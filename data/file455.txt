4550111 private industry is where the innovations need to come from
4550112 obama is a great talker but can he lead congress into the right moves to salvage the economy
4550113 no matter who wins the november election the economy will not improve overnight
4550114 we must find a way for the national government as well as state and local government to cut out the wasteful spending bring jobs back to america and find alternative energy sources
4550115 i do not like the war stance of mccain but have economic issues with more government programs and other democrat obama economics

4550119 i have been a grocery shopper for 50 years and i am dismayed at how much prices are rising

4550124 it was an effort to get input on our plan in a collaborative manner
4550125 it is important that we try to address the concerns of our neighbors the community and the town of summerfield the meeting on the 31st was the first step in that process
4550126 just how many grocery stores do we need in this area anyway
4550127 we already have a walgreens going up 100 yards from a cvs with a food lion behind it i thought this was summerfield not wendover avenue
4550128 if it were flat i would be much less concerned but that septic field slopes downward and could seep into the water systems it just doesnt stand to reason that that would work
4550129 the developer said they did a traffic study and this development wouldnt impact traffic by more than about two seconds
4550130 we are clearly taking those comments seriously thats really the stage were in now with the planning process
4550131 a quebec arbitrator has imposed a collective agreement on wal mart for the first time in the worlds largest retailers history

4550142 the democratic presidential candidates campaign issued a 40 page response to the book
4550143 derision and ridicule are the lowest form of argument suggesting the obama camp already has lost the debate
4550144 the obama camp and its supporters appear to be in disarray over the book responding almost irrationally with an endless string of epithets and insults
4550145 has intentionally manufactured a cult of personality in order to discourage any attempt to examine or comment critically upon any aspect of his background
4550146 critics such as myself are immediately branded as racists to discourage readers from reading and evaluating the book for themselves
4550147 its pretty hard to see how its anything other than a straightforward set of copyright violations
4550148 there are entire magazines with no commentary no criticism clearly not a case of classic fair use

4550158 we wanted the mansion to be restored to the way it was in the late 1800s in its prime so we used traditional techniques and materials to repair everything

4550168 its a smart move on both kanyes and fatburgers parts
4550169 kanye has a big brand and it takes someone like him to bring fatburger to chicago it just shows you that kanye west is not only a great entertainer but a smart businessman as well
4550170 im glad i got the chance to earn back some of the money ive spent on this street

4550243 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4550244 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4550245 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4550267 i apologize again today to the survivors and their families and to the whole catholic community we must continue to do everything in our power to ensure the safety of the children in our care
4550268 in the sense im responsible for this archdiocese i have to accept the blame
4550269 the children at risk were i thought protected and they were in this case by the monitoring and the restrictions i was interested in fairness the same values that permeate any legal system
4550270 he didnt call me up i never got an apology
4550271 the mediation process with the archdiocese of chicago was particularly effective because of the courage of the survivors and the personal involvement of cardinal george
4550272 cardinal george was actively involved in this process he has demonstrated his commitment to healing these survivors the release of his deposition today is a significant step toward openness and transparency and helps the survivors and the church community in healing and recovery

4550336 when classes open august 25 in harrold school buildings will be safer than normal thanks to this decision
4550337 critics of the plan will argue about liability or suggest that the school could have hired a security officer or off duty policeman but we all know that such officers cant be everywhere and in an emergency every second counts
4550338 gun control extremists despise this kind of common sense approach to the potential of school violence
4550339 but the time has come to challenge their head in the sand philosophy how many lives have been lost on public school and college campuses because of these insane victim disarmament measures how many students and teachers might be alive today if only lawmakers and school officials had acted as responsibly as the harrold administration
4550340 allowing armed staff and teachers will provide a last line of defense if other security measures at the school fail
4550341 no doubt the school board and mr thweatt will suffer some slings and arrows but if this decision one day saves the life of even one child it will have been worthwhile

4550348 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel

4550353 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4550354 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

4550362 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4550363 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources

4550368 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

4550372 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4550373 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4550374 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4550375 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4550376 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4550377 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4550378 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4550379 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

4550381 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4550382 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4550383 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4550384 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4550385 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4550386 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

4550393 if anyone is below 50 a gallon id be stunned
4550394 we have a pretty good idea on how to grow algae the biggest challenge is in the harvesting and how to extract it from the water
4550395 you arent going to find a fuel thats pennies on the dollar than what we find today
4550396 even if we were to double the volume we were to make in biofuels every year for the next 10 years were still looking at maybe this will impact 15 percent of the overall fuel supply
4550397 realistically for anything to be happening at scale enough to actually impact an airlines bottom line were years away
4550398 the presence of these aeds will add another level of safety for everyone in our school buildings students faculty staff parents and members of the community
4550399 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4550400 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4550401 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4550402 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4550403 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4550404 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4550405 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4550406 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4550407 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4550408 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4550409 the stuff they make and serve have little real mexican in the design and to be honest just doesnt taste was good as california toritilla
4550410 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4550411 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4550412 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4550413 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4550414 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4550415 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4550416 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4550417 evidently shows that the government does not want the existence of a harmonious society
4550418 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4550419 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4550420 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4550421 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

4550781 in chinas olympic moment foreign critics are focusing on all the country has failed to achieve from its abundant air pollution to scant human rights chinas citizens on the other hand see all that the country has accomplished after emerging from foreign domination and internal turmoil they are proud of those achievements and resentful of foreigners pointing out chinas shortcomings especially when those failings dont bother the alleged victims
4550782 china has a long tradition of people trying to fit into the group moderating their behaviour to avoid standing out conspicuously a culture reinforced by the man made collectivism of the past half century

4550892 i didnt know if i would bring another kicker in another running back im glad i waited the rhodes kid was here all summer and worked his butt off i know a lot of the coaches wanted to bring him in even before this
4550893 i have been reading all of the dire new rules for test taking with cisco and microsoft
4550894 will the volume of ccies start to go down with the new testing program it will be interesting to see if cisco ccies and microsoft mcse numbers start to slide
4550895 the second group of ccies are the sitting ccies they need to re certify every two years by passing the written again will that number start to drop too
4550896 if the numbers do slide downward will cisco relax the braindump filters to maintain the growth in high level certifications to support worldwide sales will end users and vars see certain numbers as weaker than others
4550897 you are a ccie 21xxx that was cisco pre braindump filtering so we
4550898 another unknown of the change in the rules is documentation cisco press focuses on what sells that is fair except if you are interested in anything other than ccie r s go to amazon com and look for ccie voice ccie security very dated ccie service provider ccie storage what will cisco do to make sure that the candidates have all of the resources necessary to pass the written and the lab
4550899 the last group is the ccie training organizations the rumors have long been that they use the braindumps ex students and their own staffs testing experience to help assure that their training material is relevant not teaching the test but understanding what is on the test
4550900 your frame relay cloud will have ospf running across it so you want to
4550901 my bet is that the number of ccies minted each year will start to drop as students cannot pass the written to even sit for the lab at 350 a pop for the written and 1 290 for the lab what do you do if you are looking at 3 written and 5 labs 7 500 without air travel hotel car food training time for each attempt etc you just might pass on the whole proposition
4550902 for sitting ccies things might be looking very rosy in the next few years cisco would have to start being nice to us again maybe some raises in the works

4550919 never ever will georgia reconcile itself with the occupation of even one square kilometre of its territory
4550920 a significant part of georgian territory remains under foreign military occupation
4550921 it is the position of the united states that that will require international peacekeeping forces that are neutral in the conflict
4550922 would never ask georgia to sign on to something where its interests were not protected
4550923 there really did have to be important clarifications in order to make sure that georgian interests are protected
4550924 i think it would be a major accomplishment for georgia to get the russians out of their country and back effectively to the status quo

4551081 this new tactic is likely to be more successful than recent single line spam campaigns because it looks like a legitimate e mail news update
4551082 they are trying to do something to regain their power

4551084 we send out hundreds of thousands of legitimate email newsletters requested by our consumers every week the key is not falling for the trickery of spammers and being able to discern what is real and what is fake

4551160 by acquiring i2 we double our addressable market in manufacturing to include discrete manufacturing complementing our current market leadership in process manufacturing and strengthening our retail and transportation management presence a major player in the supply chain space for more than 20 years i2s world class customers and employees are the perfect match for jda with the experience gained from the successful acquisition of manugistics in 2006 the addition of i2 is comparatively an incremental and logical step for jda
4551161 we are confident in our abilities to execute and deliver on projected synergies creating significant incremental shareholder value
4551162 the i2 user base which has been very loyal and i2 has delivered a lot of value to them over the years were willing to be patient while i2 sorted things out and i think there was an expectation that at the end of the process there needed to be a vision for new investment and things needed going forward
4551163 but i am just not convinced that jda is the right company we have advised our clients to have are placement plan in place if needed that they can execute it is nota panic situation but the long term plans of shippers need to look at alternatives from either their erp provider or some of the specialists that serve the needs of their industry

4551166 when i was in my 30s 50 just seemed so ancient to me
4551167 i was in high school when she hit it big
4551168 now that her first young fans are in their 30s we look at madonna as sort of a harbinger of the future for us and the future looks pretty good
4551169 is that aging is not the inevitability that we might have assumed by watching our fathers now in their 50s and 60s madonna is proof that exercising and eating right at an early age pays off
4551170 i want to know who her doctor is its really hard to believe shes 50 she looks 40 and she just keeps going at it living life and loving life
4551171 put a picture of a 50 year old woman today next to one from my mothers generation
4551172 we look at least 10 to 15 years younger than they did
4551173 also 50 really is a new beginning for so many women
4551174 many have accomplished a number of their goals already their children are getting older for the first time they can really think about themselves and ask what do i want from life
4551175 as the cliche goes i guess its better than the alternative
4551176 i just dont feel like what 50 should feel like
4551177 i remember my grandmother at 50 her hair was completely white my mother too was just at a very different place in her life than i am now
4551178 shes done a remarkable job of marketing herself and shes always been able to reinvent herself

4551193 im going to be out there in the next couple of days he said
4551194 im going to be playing the last two preseason games ill be ready
4551195 write down a lot in the meeting room you ask more questions he said
4551196 its not like being out there but it helps just having mental reps
4551197 it would be an embarrassment if they go out there monday and theres not a kicker out there

4551201 this global agreement is the latest example of how we are moving national paper bargaining forward and making a difference on behalf of our members in the industry

4551207 the sanford lab at homestake holds the potential for great scientific discovery but only if we can get our best and brightest involved in this research this new scholarship program will spark an interest in science among our own south dakota students
4551208 i feel like ive earned every at bat ive ever gotten in my life because i didnt sign for much and i wasnt a big time prospect i just plugged away and worked hard every day thats why it means a lot more to me than people might think things werent handed to me i worked hard every day to get here and im going to work harder to stay here
4551209 i go depending on how my swing is feeling its kind of like a basic job
4551210 when people go to work at a job they work at what they need to get better at if they have a problem thats how i treat it if i feel something is off i have to work on it i want to be the best i can because i want to be here when all this turns around
4551211 i would say all my family and all my coaches because everybody had their hand in it
4551212 my parents made sure i always had a good glove bats and cleats those are the little things people forget about its the dedication i had from my family in little league high school all the way through college that made me the player i am
4551213 people tell me when youre on base something good is going to happen for this team
4551214 at this time of the year every win is huge no matter who you play
4551215 i did a lot of different things this off season
4551216 we went back to the basics we worked every single day to get more consistency of technique so that no matter what situation i am in im able to get off a good punt
4551217 the appointment of kevin odea as special teams coach who is more of a punting specialist has certainly helped me out
4551218 the one on one counseling will scale because we already have a network of ex ncaa coaches in place across all sports that are recruiting experts and are ready to set up time with athletes

4551220 you can buy the beautiful decorator antiques in all the other shops around birmingham but you cant find the fun stuff that we have here
4551221 we deal in advertising toys collectables we deal in retro items from the 50s and 60s
4551222 i wanted to be a part of the renaissance of downtown birmingham the rebirth it has really taken off since we opened
4551223 those businesses bring visitors to the area people become familiar with the area choose to invest it encourages more people to live in the city center
4551224 whats good for one business is good for every business in downtown now were even getting nightlife on second avenue which is wonderful theres music all around us bars and restaurants are starting to open

4551227 mass extinction in the oceans with unknown ecological and evolutionary consequences
4551228 lobsters know when their shell is damaged and thats probably the reason when they have shell disease why they molt more quickly
4551229 but ultimately they still come down with the disease and we think the presence of alkyphenols contributes to that
4551230 plastics last a long time but breakdown products last even longer perhaps shell disease is only the tip of the iceberg of a more basic problem of endocrine disrupting chemicals in marine environments
4551231 our members are already struggling to keep up with rising food and energy costs this pay offer is an insult
4551232 in what other ways is this business falling down on the job

4551234 my personal opinion and based on my opinion of the christian faith thats not the type of expression a presidential candidate or anyone following the christian faith ought to make
4551235 know that john mccains faith and character were tested and forged in ways few can fathom
4551236 its heartbreaking to think something like that would happen here
4551237 i cannot imagine what would drive somebody to do that
4551238 very strong very determined i dont know what id do in his position im proud of him i can tell you that im proud of him
4551239 a settlement of this magnitude sends the clear message that this office takes health care fraud very seriously

4551241 cuando nos planteamos redise ar las salas dedicadas al antiguo egipto que no hab an sufrido ning n cambio en m s de 20 a os decidimos iniciar un di logo con los visitantes sobre cu l es la mejor manera de exhibir las momias
4551242 yo creo que hay que regresar las momias a sus tumbas como una muestra de respeto respeto al ser humano m s all de cualquier culto creencia o religi n respeto por personas que pidieron descansar en paz
4551243 seqenen ra ta ii llamado el m rtir es un h roe para los antiguos egipcios no es necesario mostrar su agon a al momento de morir el dolor en sus brazos en sus manos por qu estamos mostrando un hombre tan importante para nosotros de esa forma
4551244 nosotros nos hemos planteado c mo exhibir las momias de una forma correcta respetuosa protegi ndolas del deterioro pero nunca hemos pensado en dejar de exhibirlas
4551245 son personas muertas que deben ser enterradas o s mbolos de la antigua cultura egipcia nosotros pensamos que son parte de nuestra herencia no cad veres que representan la fant stica habilidad de los antiguos egipcios para preservar a estos seres queridos
4551246 para m las momias son personas muertas no son monumentos no son piedras no son estatuas no son pilares son seres humanos carne hueso sangre
4551247 existen adem s decenas de textos que nosotros llamamos maldiciones donde se amenaza a quien interrumpa el sue o de los faraones aquellos que me despierten de mis descanso eterno enfrentar n el fuego o la muerte vendr con alas r pidas contra aquellos que entren a mi tumba tomen mis cosas o manipulen mi cuerpo y hay muchos m s
4551248 la mayor a de las momias exhibidas tanto en el museo egipcio como en todo el mundo fueron movidas mucho tiempo atr s de sus tumbas originales en el pasado egipto sufri varias invasiones y los antiguos egipcios movieron las momias a ubicaciones secretas para protegerlas as que nosotros no las hemos sacado de su lugar de origen
4551249 yo no estoy de acuerdo con la excusa del estudio cient fico y le pongo como ejemplo la momia de tutmosis i desde que fue colocado en su caja de vidrio en el museo egipcio d cadas atr s tiene un signo de pregunta al lado de su nombre entonces por m s que lo han sacado de su tumba nunca hemos estado seguros de que se trate de tutmosis i
4551250 desde la perspectiva isl mica yo me tom el trabajo de preguntarle a alguna de nuestras eminencias religiosas si es correcto exponer gente muerta de esa manera y estas figuras me dijeron que desde el punto de vista isl mico no es correcto m s all de la creencia de esa persona
4551251 si uno le pregunta a cualquiera que nos muestre a su abuelo de esa forma por 100 libras egipcias alguien estar a de acuerdo yo lo dudo
4551252 desde una perspectiva isl mica o desde un enfoque basado en las creencias del antiguo egipto
4551253 si tenemos una serie de momias vinculadas a un per odo hist rico determinado mantenidas en buena condici n lo que estamos haciendo es mostrar uno de lo grandes misterios del pasado
4551254 incluso hoy es un interrogante conocemos qu elementos utilizaron sabemos c mo lo hicieron pero no lo podemos repetir actualmente no podemos momificar nada por m s de seis meses sin que empiece a deteriorarse ese es mi punto de vista sobre las momias
4551255 hitler eva braun y 13 jerarcas nazis aterrizaron en barcelona el 27 de abril de 1945 en un vuelo que parti de berl n e hizo escala en linz austria

4551259 los alemanes dejaron cad veres en los b nkers con credenciales de sus jerarcas para que el mundo creyera que se trataba de ellos incluso se utilizaron varios dobles de hitler

4551270 no jailhouse religious conversion can sufficiently alter the character of such an evil callous wanton and malignant individual
4551271 there is no excuse justification nor mitigation for the devastation that the defendants have inflicted on the park family
4551272 a decision on a piece of hardware like that would potentially be deployed conservatively to 200 000 people
4551273 you know its a big decision especially when you have an existing fleet out there
4551274 both countries should resolve all bilateral issues including the kashmir dispute through dialogue and adhere to the peace process at times harsh statements emanating from either side cast a shadow over the cordiality of relations between india and pakistan but the regular contacts at the highest level would help to dispel the uncertainties created
4551275 the greatest enemies of india and pakistan are hunger poverty ignorance disease and terrorism and both the countries needed to work together to fight these adversaries
4551276 the evidence is that no one blinked and if youre still looking for a blinker clinton blinked and agreed to what obama had first proposed in june

4551288 security problems go away by mandating independent security testing before a product is accepted not by trying to get security researchers to be quiet this is a good example of how the reactive approach doesnt work the flaws are still in the system and suing researchers has just shined a bright light on them

4551341 apa yang membuatmu berpikiran seperti itu apa yang harus aku lakukan untuk merubah pikiranmu
4551342 saya punya pertanyaan jika kau bisa menemukan jawabannya dalam hatiku aku kan merubah pikiran saya seandainya saya menyukai setangkai bunga indah yang ada di tebing gunung dan kita berdua tahu jika kamu memanjat dan mengambil bunga itu kamu akan mati apakah kau akan mengambilkannya untukku
4551343 sayang aku tidak akan mengambilkan bunga itu untukmu tapi ijinkan aku menjelaskan alasannya
4551344 kamu biasa mengetik di komputer da n biasa mengacaukan programnya di pcnya dan akhirnya menangis di depan monitor saya harus memberikan jari2 saya supaya bisa membantumu memperbaiki program2nya

4551350 tanganku akan memegang tanganmu membimbingmu menelusuri tepian pantai menikmati matahari pagi dan pasir yang indah menceritakan warna warni bunga yang indah seperti dirimu
4551351 tapi sayangku saya tidak akan mengambil bunga itu untuk mati karena aku tidak sanggup melihat air matamu mengalir menangisi kematianku
4551352 sayangku saya tahu banyak orang yang bisa mencintaimu lebih dari aku
4551353 untuk itu sayang jika tanganku kakiku mataku dan semua yang telah aku berikan untukmu tidak cukup bagimu aku tidak bisa menahan dirimu mencari tangan yang lain kaki yang lain serta mata yang lebih bisa membahagiakanmu

4551356 through nbc ge has paid hundreds of million of dollars to broadcast the olympics
4551357 will we see tough pieces on nbc news and an aggressive effort to take full advantage of these temporary media regulations or is it all going to be sweetness and light
4551358 a nation is about to put a match to the fuse of a rocket
4551359 such a tremendous heartfelt effort at hospitality by the chinese people and they would like to reach past all of the political barriers past all of the disagreements that both sides know exist and try to touch really to some degree the key things that americans and chinese have in common one of my chinese friends said to me recently where we are today would not be possible without america if we hadnt had the american example and i think more than anything they would like americans to reach through the television set and try and see to some degree what china stands for
4551360 i think china is changed irrevocably after these 17 days it is a full aware part of the international community and they know that their behavior in that community is going to have to be different than in the past
4551361 works as a managing director and partner at the beijing office of kissinger associates
4551362 im for engagement i helped to set up princetons summer program in china
4551363 wir sind gut unterwegs wir werden in diesem jahr bereits in die n he kommen insofern geht der blick hier eher nach oben als nach unten

4551365 every door seemed to require a bit more effort to open and close
4551366 you are a liar and a cad and i spit on your tears
4551367 last night i had a dream that my you know what suddenly grew to like 20 inches long
4551368 you wouldnt touch me of course but you were making a fortune by pimping me out
4551369 remember how we used to do it four or five times a day
4551370 whats so damn special about insert clive owen or similarly hot british actor here

4551373 my life would be complete if i could just find a pair of dirty socks to carry to the laundry
4551374 nope and im expecting my penis to grow in any day now because of it

4551378 please allow 2 adults and 3 children in to see walle thanx so and so the manager
4551379 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4551380 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4551381 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4551382 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4551383 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4551384 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4551385 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4551386 its pretty hard to see how its anything other than a straightforward set of copyright violations
4551387 there are entire magazines with no commentary no criticism clearly not a case of classic fair use
4551388 the first sale doctrine says that once i buy a physical copy of something i can do whatever i want with it except copy it
4551389 we take our intellectual property seriously and are considering appropriate action on this matter

4551391 presenting an exciting mix of contemporary and new plays in historic downtown lowell
4551392 because of him we use the term rhythm and blues and we hail ray charles as genius and aretha franklin as queen
4551393 how many times must you keep asking that you cant keep asking the same question
4551394 with respect my lord i will ask it as many times as i consider it necessary
4551395 to get it finished with any mistakes in the document could be clarified in court
4551396 they must at least give us until month end to sort ourselves out because now we dont have money for rent
4551397 i will try to be very clear over the barry situation everyone has been talking and it seems that the blame is put on me
4551398 i get blamed for everything for global warming to high petrol prices but in this case i want to be very clear since i talked to martin oneill about the situation in april i have not talked to anyone at aston villa
4551399 all the talks have been between our chief executive rick parry the owner and the chief executive of aston villa and those talks have all been pretty good
4551400 so if anyone wants to talk about barry in the future they must talk with the owner rick parry or the chief executive of aston villa and as i have said those talks i understand have been good
4551401 i was not involved in the talks about barry i was not involved in the talks about xabi alonso and arsenal if you want to talk about these players you must talk to the chief executive of our club who was handling the discussions
4551402 if you want to talk about players then you talk to rick parry if you want to talk about football then you talk with me
4551403 you have to be opportunistic when you have a squad like ours i would just like our olympic players back to help us
4551404 but we will probably have one player in the final the rest can return soon
4551405 the age of the squad is much lower they are good players and can be a very good team for now and the future
4551406 cheri sounded tired the pregnancy had already started wearing her out and she had not slept well since the accident
4551407 every time i throw up i think that at least it means im still pregnant
4551408 for a moment she did not recognize the sound of her own name surely they had made a mistake
4551409 with some of the small issues i have got with the front tyre the only way i can ride is brake as hard as i can and almost back it in like a supermoto
4551410 and as soon as i get full lean angle i just roll to maximum throttle opening because i cant carry lots of momentum with 250 lines like i need to i need to get the rear to come round to steer the bike
4551411 the rear tyre feels fantastic and im really happy with that
4551412 looking at the performance level now maybe yes because me and casey are a little bit faster than the other bridgestone guys and dani pedrosa has a problem with his wrist so maybe it is possible to have another battle
4551413 i think that in laguna i improved a lot with my riding style with the line because i dont know laguna like brno i had less experience
4551414 here i have raced for a lot more years i know this track also the bike is improving so we are very close
4551415 but anyway stoner is very strong and very difficult to beat
4551416 but for me i wasnt upset with him because i know he said something bad after the race just because he was very hot and upset to lose the race so for me the relationship is the same
4551417 we modified a bit the set up of the bike to try and improve the braking and the stability in the corners
4551418 in the middle of the afternoon we tried something different but i wasnt very fast
4551419 the theory is that if you place points of interest in the intersections or along the lines that your photo becomes more balanced and will enable a viewer of the image to interact with it more naturally studies have shown that when viewing images that peoples eyes usually go to one of the intersection points most naturally rather than the center of the shot using the rule of thirds works with this natural way of viewing an image rather than working against it
4551420 ok i got the concept and i can do that effectively and well designed
4551421 profiled several indian women and girls to get an idea of the reality of their daily lives
4551422 never seen anything like this in my career for software
4551423 at first i thought i had pants on apparently not
4551424 when it comes to women i just think look at them until they notice you and hope for the best
4551425 i never had any idea how to talk to girls until a year or so ago i still come out with trivial c p when im flirting but i like to think im doing it in a faintly endearing way
4551426 i ran out of my house to join 10 people trying to lift up the bus
4551427 at first we couldnt get it up so then another 10 people ran over to help and we got the bus up and the lady out
4551428 the light turned red and i couldnt stop i tried to miss her
4551429 ive not been feeling well for a few days and i felt very weak today i even felt sapped of energy just putting my gloves on
4551430 i can deal with a bit of tiredness but this afternoon i could only ride a handful of laps before i started to feel cramps in my stomach
4551431 my lap time is not too bad but i think we can improve on that we have the power and i need to work on my rhythm a bit
4551432 production has not reached the critical stage the company is very reasonable thanks to our achievements in the past so although i do normally get pressured thats not happened yet on the current project and thats something i feel gratitude for that the company gives us the opportunity to focus by giving us time
4551433 im working on a playstation 3 title thats as far as i can go
4551434 about half as many as i have been married for
4551435 ive been playing the sport for well 10 years if you mean how long
4551436 its a wasteful pursuit when its not even included in olympics the sports minister should ban such a useless sport
4551437 i was praying to the lord to make you one
4551438 have you no sense of patriotism look at the chinese what a sacrifice each one of them is making to see that the olympic is a success
4551439 you could have contributed by playing an olympic sport like shooting each small drop counts cant you see
4551440 its a historical feat a top 10 finish in a major tournament is something we all indians should be proud of with this he is already on course to win a major championship one day
4551441 who knows one day golf might be included in the olympics and then as you said each small drop would count wont it

4551445 its pretty hard to see how its anything other than a straightforward set of copyright violations
4551446 there are entire magazines with no commentary no criticism clearly not a case of classic fair use
4551447 the first sale doctrine says that once i buy a physical copy of something i can do whatever i want with it except copy it
4551448 we take our intellectual property seriously and are considering appropriate action on this matter
4551449 however i learned a lot about advertising and wish i had been older and more experienced so that i could have handled the situation as it was a most interesting position
4551450 theyve finally after all these years theyve gotten the names out all of these people had been told never to mention they were with the oss
4551451 were saying the oss was a lot bigger than they were saying
4551452 umm okay thats nice but could you call me back when you get to london because sir thomas moore is about to be executed
4551453 those french think they are so smart saying that true champagne can only come from a certain region spumante is the same thing same grape same process and far better in my humble albeit italian opinion
4551454 not exactly but i have been taking it for a year in high school
4551455 you have to have four years of french to go to france you know
4551456 freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction
4551457 we have taken the substances for which measurements have actually been obtained very few of course because its difficult to even find these chemicals in diffuse and diluted ets
4551458 we posit a sealed unventilated enclosure that is 20 feet square with a 9 foot ceiling clearance
4551459 taking the figures for ets yields per cigarette directly from the epa we calculated the number of cigarettes that would be required to reach the lowest published
4551460 our chart table 1 illustrates each of these substances but let me report some notable examples
4551461 for benzo a pyrene 222 000 cigarettes would be required to reach the lowest published
4551462 toluene would require 50 000 packs of simultaneously smoldering cigarettes
4551463 at the lower end of the scale in the case of acetaldehyde or hydrazine more than 14 000 smokers would need to light up simultaneously in our little room to reach the threshold at which they might begin to pose a danger
4551464 of course the moment we introduce real world factors to the room a door an open window or two or a healthy level of mechanical air exchange remember the room weve been talking about is sealed achieving these levels becomes even more implausible
4551465 it becomes increasingly clear to us that ets is a political rather than scientific scapegoat
4551466 the committee remains concerned that powers under the official secrets act 1989 have been exercised to frustrate former employees of the crown from bringing into the public domain issues of genuine public interest and can be exercised to prevent the media from publishing such matters
4551467 it notes that disclosures of information are penalized even where they are not harmful to national security
4551468 should investigate allegations related to transit through its territory of rendition flights and establish an inspection system to ensure that its airports are not used for such purposes
4551469 while the committee is disturbed by the extension of the maximum period of detention without charge of terrorist suspects under the terrorism act 2006 from 14 days to 28 days it is even more disturbed by the proposed extension of this maximum period of detention under the counterterrorism bill from 28 days to 42 days
4551470 if we cant even pronounce beijing correctly and consistently how can we ever hope to address deeper cross cultural misunderstandings and conflicts
4551471 ive met the old girlfriend and she is lovely she is more beautiful than she was before irresistible
4551472 i am just delighted to be back i just want to be back doing what i do and thats living the life of a bullfighter
4551473 so i thought id better go and get a checkup just to make sure
4551474 heres a woman thats successful takes care of herself looks amazing and she took the steps to get there it doesnt happen unless you take charge shes a great role model for many many women
4551475 when i was in my 30s 50 just seemed so ancient to me
4551476 i was in high school when she hit it big
4551477 now that her first young fans are in their 30s we look at madonna as sort of a harbinger of the future for us and the future looks pretty good
4551478 is that aging is not the inevitability that we might have assumed by watching our fathers now in their 50s and 60s madonna is proof that exercising and eating right at an early age pays off
4551479 i want to know who her doctor is its really hard to believe shes 50 she looks 40 and she just keeps going at it living life and loving life
4551480 put a picture of a 50 year old woman today next to one from my mothers generation
4551481 we look at least 10 to 15 years younger than they did
4551482 also 50 really is a new beginning for so many women
4551483 many have accomplished a number of their goals already their children are getting older for the first time they can really think about themselves and ask what do i want from life
4551484 as the cliche goes i guess its better than the alternative
4551485 i just dont feel like what 50 should feel like
4551486 i remember my grandmother at 50 her hair was completely white my mother too was just at a very different place in her life than i am now
4551487 shes done a remarkable job of marketing herself and shes always been able to reinvent herself
4551488 the most effective way for an enterprise to reduce the total cost of ownership of its pcs is through the implementation of management best practices across all phases of the pc life cycle

4551501 there are a lot of background talks going on whereby a way is trying to be found so that there is no impeachment
4551502 as far as the numbers game is concerned it is all over
4551503 so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4551504 we have conveyed to them that the coalition is determined for impeachment and if he wants to save himself the best way is for him to quit

4551628 los modelos pedag gicos te ricos y pr cticos utilizados en la ense anza
4551629 nota para una reflexi n epistemol gica sobre la ense anza
4551630 pedagog a nombra una disciplina en formaci n que utilizando modelos y conceptos de otras disciplinas busca plantear m todos para los problemas de la ense anza y no un m todo para la ense anza aunque su esencia como saber concreto es el m todo ste no debe pensarse como un simple procedimiento pues est soportado y las fuentes de la pedagog a dan cuenta de ello por una trama de nociones que se refieren a la formaci n del hombre al conocimiento al lenguaje a la selecci n del saber a la escuela y su funci n social a la concepci n del maestro
4551631 el discurso instruccional presupone el proceso de recontextualizaci n mediante el cual los discursos han sido hist ricamente removidos del campo de su producci n transformados y transferidos al campo educativo o de reproducci n este proceso de recontextualizaci n es relativamente complejo e implica un campo de recontextualizaci n oficial y un campo de recontextualizaci n pedag gica
4551632 en la medida que el saber educar pr ctica educativa de todos los pueblos se tematiza y se hace expl cito aparece la pedagog a hay pedagog a cuando se reflexiona sobre la educaci n cuando el saber educar impl cito se convierte en un saber sobre la educaci n sobre sus c mo sus porqu sus hacia d nde el desarrollo moderno de la pedagog a significa adicionalmente sistematizaci n de este saber de sus m todos y procedimientos y la delimitaci n de su objetivo
4551633 prescindir caprichosamente de los antiguos conocimientos en favor de novedades inferiores
4551634 ha de tomarse en consideraci n el empleo de historiadores antrop logos y soci logos cualitativos profesionalmente adiestrados la historia narrativa es una parte indispensable del informe final y en su preparaci n se deber an utilizar los mejores m todos cualitativos
4551635 hay otra raz n que acent a el valor de los m todos m ltiples otra raz n que a pesar del movimiento de sus m todos da a la ciencia moderna una feliz estabilidad es el hecho de que cualquier crisis profunda en el m todo es inmediatamente una conciencia de la reorganizaci n del m todo
4551636 cambiando de m todos la ciencia se hace cada vez m s met dica
4551637 todos tenemos que ser un poco positivistas un poco empiristas un poco marxistas y un poco de la escuela de los annales es muy dif cil escribir la historia con un criterio estrecho acogi ndose solamente a un m todo o a una sola perspectiva anal tica en la historia como en cualquier otro campo del an lisis social hay que tener y defender una visi n amplia liberal sin cortapisas intelectuales en caso contrario nuestro oficio ser una empresa poco llamativa y nada atractiva para los analistas de m s talento
4551638 una ciencia que pretende entender interpret ndola la acci n social para de esa manera explicarla causalmente en su desarrollo y efectos por acci n debe entenderse una conducta humana siempre que el sujeto o sujetos de la acci n anlacen a ella un sentido subjetivo
4551639 el desarrollo de una acci n repetida por los mismos agentes o extendida a muchos cuyo sentido mentado es t picamente homog neo ib dem p gina 23
4551640 no puede haber realidad sin historia los hechos deben complementarse con tendencias aunque stas sean categor as distintas de la l gica
4551641 la pretensi n de la investigaci n acci n de tener aplicaci n en la soluci n de problemas s lo tiene sustentaci n metodol gica si busca explicaciones o causas de los hechos estudiados porque entonces s se podr a actuar sobre ellas
4551642 al considerar la pr ctica de la ense anza como una actividad reflexiva la divisi n del trabajo entre pr cticos e investigadores se desvanece
4551643 confiere realidad a las caracter sticas t picas de la interrelaci n dial ctica traduce la teor a en una opci n concreta no solo prob ndola en la realidad sino sobre todo realizando expl citamente la opci n pol tica e ideol gica que contiene
4551644 la producci n y reproducci n el intercambio y la negociaci n la destrucci n y la lucha y los procesos de socializaci n propios de la educaci n
4551645 un m todo cient fico es un m todo que busca el riesgo se arriesga en una adquisici n el pensamiento cient fico es un pensamiento comprometido constantemente pone en juego su propia constituci n cualquiera que persevere en una investigaci n se ve obligado tarde o temprano a cambiar de m todo

4551648 el mensaje depende de la voz y el sujeto es una relaci n dial ctica entre voz y mensaje sin embargo
4551649 el discurso pedag gico resulta ser las reglas de comunicaci n especializadas a trav s de las cuales los sujetos pedag gicos se crean selectivamente
4551650 el docente la pedagog a y la organizaci n curricular como variables esenciales para el mejoramiento de la calidad la eficiencia y la equidad de la educaci n superior

4551656 conjunto de rasgos individuales y silenciadores que producen su efecto d a a d a y que resultan indicativos de unas determinadas realizaciones futuras
4551657 son estructuras que presentan ciertas potencialidades funcionales el desarrollo de esas potencialidades de cada cual depende de los factores ambientales
4551658 en general se concibe que una prueba de aptitud intenta medir ciertos rasgos psicol gicos estables unitarios y algo independientes que se estiman son requisitos para un trabajo o para el estudio de una especialidad dada ejemplos de estas caracter sticas son memoria fluidez verbal percepci n espacial razonamiento verbal etc
4551659 las pruebas de aptitud hacen uso de instrucciones y emplean un vocabulario que es necesario entender es decir haberlo aprendido previamente para poder responder
4551660 las pruebas de aptitud acad mica como ser an las pruebas de admisi n a estudios superiores miden s lo aprendizaje basado en habilidades aprendidas

4551667 la otra clase de fil sofos considera al hombre como un ser racional m s bien que activo y se esfuerza por formar su entendimiento m s que por cultivar sus maneras consideran la naturaleza humana como asunto de especulaci n y la escudri an cuidadosamente para encontrar aquellos principios que regulan nuestro entendimiento exaltan nuestros sentimientos y nos hacen aprobar o censurar cualquier objeto acci n o conducta aun cuando sus especulaciones puedan parecer abstractas e incluso ininteligibles para el lector com n buscan la aprobaci n de sabios y eruditos se creen suficientemente recompensados por el esfuerzo de toda una vida si logran descubrir verdades ocultas que puedan contribuir a la instrucci n de la posteridad
4551668 la filosof a sencilla y evidente siempre tendr dentro del com n de la humanidad mayor acogida que la precisa y abstrusa y ser recomendada por muchos no s lo por ser m s agradable sino m s til que la segunda se aviene mejor a la vida cotidiana moldea el coraz n y los afectos al tocar aquellos principios que mueven a los hombres a la acci n reforma su conducta y los aproxima a aquel modelo de perfecci n que describe la filosof a abstracta por el contrario al estar fundamentada en una actitud de la mente que dif cilmente incide en la acci n desaparece cuando el fil sofo sale de las sombras a la luz del d a tampoco consiguen sus principios ejercer mayor influencia sobre nuestra conducta y comportamiento los sentimientos de nuestro coraz n la agitaci n de nuestras pasiones la vehemencia de nuestros afectos disipan todas sus conclusiones y reducen al fil sofo profundo a la condici n de un mero plebeyo
4551669 entr gate a tu pasi n por la ciencia escribe all mismo pero por una ciencia humana tal que pueda incidir directamente sobre la acci n y la sociedad proh bo el pensamiento abstracto y las investigaciones profundas y los castigar severamente con la pensativa melancol a que inducen con la interminable incertidumbre que generan y con la fr a recepci n que hallar n sus presuntos descubrimientos cuando sean comunicados s un fil sofo pero en medio de toda tu filosof a contin a siendo un hombre
4551670 alcanzar un grado suficiente de exactitud en sus sentimientos preceptos o raciocinios un artista estar a mejor calificado para llevar a cabo con xito una tarea semejante pues adem s de un gusto delicado y de una r pida aprehensi n posee un conocimiento preciso 3 ib d p g 13 4 ib d p gs 15 16 12 slide 13 de la estructura interna de las operaciones del entendimiento del funcionamiento de las pasiones y de las diversas especies del sentimiento que discriminan entre vicio y virtud el anatomista nos presenta los objetos m s horribles y desagradables pero su ciencia es de gran utilidad para el pintor incluso cuando esboza una venus o una helena mientras que este ltimo emplea los colores m s ricos de su paleta para dar a sus figuras un aspecto gr cil y atrayente debe sin embargo atender a la estructura interna del cuerpo humano la posici n de los m sculos la estructura de los huesos el uso y aspecto de toda parte u rgano la precisi n es en todos los casos ventajosa para la belleza tanto como el justo razonamiento para el sentimiento delicado en vano exaltar amos uno de ellos si desde amos el otro

4551674 en caso de que realmente se hubiera producido una p rdida de nivel resultar a compensada con el aumento de pluralismo en los planteamientos
4551675 los pol ticos en cuestiones educativas transforman r pidamente estos diagn sticos de crisis en un intento por convertir en despreciables a las ciencias de la discusi n
4551676 nuestra poca es de modo especial la de la cr tica todo ha de someterse a ella
4551677 linguam manus naturalia praecidere quiere decir cortarle a alguien la lengua 12 j

4551679 nuestra raza taimada encuentra siempre caminos m s complicados y m todos m s violentos para transformar las fuerzas celestes en energ a
4551680 en todo caso raz n te rica es funci n de la raz n pr ctica el entendimiento es un servidor de la voluntad
4551681 la raz n no padece por ser distinguida en te rica pr ctica y est tica o lo que se quiera que ser hombre es serlo en un sentido teleol gico
4551682 si no me equivoco comienza a trat rsele como un gran pensador esto es como prestidigitador de un paradigma falso de cuya fascinaci n intelectual hemos de liberarnos
4551683 el concepto de libertad en cuanto realidad queda demostrado por medio de una ley apod ctica de la raz n pr ctica constituye la piedra angular de todo el edificio de la raz n pura incluso la e s p e c u l a t i v a
4551684 cuando la filosof a se atribuye un conocimiento antes del conocimiento establece un terreno propio entre ella misma y las ciencias en el cual ejerce sus funciones de dominaci n
4551685 en magazine litt raire no 309 par s avril 1993 p gs
4551686 primer curso del a o 1983 foucault interpreta el texto de kant was ist aufkl rung
4551687 la raz n humana tiene el destino singular en uno de sus campos de conocimiento de hallarse acosada por cuestiones que no puede rechazar por ser planteadas por la misma naturaleza de la raz n pero a las que tampoco puede responder por sobrepasar todas sus facultades
4551688 la perplejidad en la que cae la raz n no es debida a culpa suya alguna
4551689 de libros y sistemas sino la de la facultad de la raz n en general en relaci n con los conocimientos a los que puede aspirar prescindiendo de toda experiencia se trata pues de decidir la posibilidad o imposibilidad de una metaf sica en general y de se alar tanto las fuentes como la extensi n y l mites de la misma todo ello a partir de principios
4551690 la religi n y la legislaci n pretenden de ordinario escapar
4551691 la primera a causa de su santidad y la segunda a causa de su majestad sin embargo al hacerlo despiertan contra s mismas sospechas justificadas y no pueden exigir un respeto sincero respeto que la raz n s lo concede a lo que es capaz de resistir un examen p blico y libre
4551692 nos queda a n por intentar despu s de haber sido negado a la raz n especulativa todo avance en el terreno suprasensible si no se encuentran datos en su conocimiento pr ctico para determinar aquel concepto racional y trascendente de lo incondicionado y sobrepasar de ese modo seg n el deseo de la metaf sica los l mites de toda experiencia posible con nuestro conocimiento a priori aunque s lo desde un punto de vista pr ctico
4551693 si se echa una ligera ojeada a esta obra se puede quiz entender que su utilidad es s lo negativa nos advierte que jam s nos aventuremos a traspasar los l mites de la experiencia con la raz n especulativa y efectivamente sta es su primera utilidad pero tal utilidad se hace inmediatamente positiva ello se ve claro cuando se reconoce que la raz n pura tiene un uso pr ctico el moral absolutamente necesario uso en el que ella se ve inevitablemente obligada a ir m s all de los l mites de la sensibilidad negar a esta labor de la cr tica su utilidad positiva equivaldr a a afirmar que la polic a no presta un servicio positivo por limitarse su tarea primordial a impedir la violencia que los ciudadanos pueden temer unos de otros a fin de que cada uno pueda dedicarse a sus asuntos en paz y seguridad
4551694 pero si la cr tica no se ha equivocado al ense arnos a tomar el objeto en dos sentidos a saber como fen meno y como cosa en s si la deducci n de sus conceptos del entendimiento es correcta y por consiguiente el principio de causalidad se aplica nicamente a las cosas en el primer sentido es decir en cuanto objetos de la experiencia sin que est n sometidas en cambio esas mismas cosas en el segundo sentido si eso es as entonces se considera la voluntad en su fen meno en las acciones visibles como necesariamente conforme a las leyes naturales y en tal sentido como no libre pero por otra parte esa misma voluntad es considerada como algo perteneciente a una cosa en s misma y no sometida a dichas leyes es decir como libre sin que se d por ello contradicci n alguna
4551695 si los gobiernos creen oportuno intervenir en los asuntos de los cient ficos ser a m s adecuado a su sabia tutela tanto respecto de las ciencias como respecto de los hombres el favorecer la libertad de semejante cr tica nico medio de establecer los productos de la raz n sobre una base firme que el apoyar el rid culo despotismo de unas escuelas que levantan un griter o sobre los peligros p blicos cuando se rasgan las telara as por ellas tejidas a pesar de que la gente nunca les ha hecho caso y de que tampoco puede sentir su p rdida
4551696 llamo trascendental todo conocimiento que se ocupa no tanto de los objetos cuanto de nuestro modo de conocerlos en cuanto que tal modo ha de ser posible a priori
4551697 la experiencia s lo es posible mediante la representaci n de una necesaria conexi n de percepciones
4551698 la inclinaci n natural de la raz n a la metaf sica
4551699 hay pues una natural e inevitable dial ctica de la raz n pura no una dial ctica en la que se enreda un ignorante por falta de conocimiento o que haya inventado artificialmente alg n sofista para confundir a la gente sensata
4551700 introducen la unidad en la diversidad pero la una opera sobre los fen menos y no va m s all de la unidad multiplicada de los objetos emp ricos la otra opera sobre los conocimientos ya elaborados por el entendimiento y se esfuerza en introducir en ellos una unidad m s alta cuyo tipo ideal no es otro que la unidad absoluta
4551701 en la base de este edificio se despliega la diversidad incesantemente enriquecida de la experiencia en la cumbre fuera del alcance del entendimiento sospechamos cual una flecha que se afila en las nubes la unidad suprema e incondicionada entre la base visible y la cumbre adivinada suben unas l neas convergiendo que despuntan ya en el plano del entendimiento toda vez que la diversidad sint tica del objeto es ya una unificaci n de la diversidad confusa de los fen menos pero las l neas que reclaman aqu nuestra atenci n son aquellas que se elevan por encima incluso de la diversidad de los objetos emp ricos sigamos a estas ltimas en su convergencia hacia la unidad
4551702 tesis la causalidad seg n leyes de la naturaleza no es la nica de la que pueden derivar los fen menos todos del mundo para explicar stos nos hace falta otra causalidad por libertad
4551703 ant tesis no hay libertad todo cuanto sucede en el mundo se desarrolla exclusivamente seg n leyes de la naturaleza
4551704 s lo en la naturaleza debemos pues buscar la interdependencia y el orden de los sucesos
4551705 la filosof a que parte del campo de la experiencia y 60
4551706 si el fil sofo emp rico no pretendiera con su ant tesis m s que anular la impertinencia y osad a de una raz n que desconoce su verdadera funci n que presume de conocer y saber all donde precisamente se acaban el conocer y el saber que pretende hacer pasar por fomento del inter s especulativo lo que s lo posee validez respecto del inter s pr ctico que rompe seg n le conviene el hilo de las investigaciones relativas a la naturaleza para atarlo con la pretensi n de ampliar el conocimiento a ideas trascendentales con las que precisamente se conoce tan s lo que no se conoce nada si el fil sofo empirista digo se contentara con esto entonces su principio ser a una m xima que impondr a moderaci n en nuestras pretensiones modestia en nuestras afirmaciones y a la vez la mayor extensi n posible de nuestro entendimiento por medio del nico maestro de que en realidad disponemos a saber por medio de la experiencia
4551707 ahora bien cuando el empirismo se vuelve a su vez dogm tico en relaci n con las ideas cosa que sucede a menudo y niega insolentemente lo que se halla m s all de la esfera de sus conocimientos intuitivos es l mismo el que incurre en la falta de modestia falta que es tanto m s reprochable cuanto que en este caso ocasiona al inter s pr ctico de la raz n un da o irreparable
4551708 el nico resultado al que pod amos llegar y lo nico que quer amos conseguir era dejar claro al menos que esa antinomia reposa sobre una mera ilusi n que naturaleza y causalidad por libertad no son incompatibles
4551709 dado que en este caso la ilusi n dial ctica no s lo es enga osa en lo que se refiere al juicio sino que es adem s tentadora y natural como lo ser siempre incluso en lo que toca al inter s puesto en este juicio me ha parecido aconsejable redactar detalladamente las actas de este proceso por as decirlo y archivarlas en la raz n humana con el fin de prevenir errores de esta clase en el futuro
4551710 admitir que los principios puros del derecho poseen una verdadera realidad objetiva o sea que pueden llevarse a buen fin y que en consecuencia el pueblo en el estado y los estados en sus relaciones con otros estados han de comportarse de acuerdo con esos principios digan lo que digan los pol ticos 50 cf
4551711 seg n l kant se puede delimitar el campo de esta filosof a en sentido universal mediante estas cuatro preguntas 1 qu puedo saber 2 qu debo hacer 3 qu me cabe esperar 4 qu es el hombre p g 12 la cuesti n cuarta ser a pues la que pregunta por la finitud del hombre pero ya no se trata de una cuesti n antropol gica puesto que preguntamos por la esencia de nuestra existencia en lugar pues de la antropolog a tendr amos como fundamento la ontolog a fundamental
4551712 sobre la situaci n de las ciencias sociales y humanas geisteswissenschaften en alemania una mirada a su evoluci n en la postguerra
4551713 no hay nada en el mundo que sin limitaci n pueda ser tenido por bueno sino la buena voluntad
4551714 por ejemplo es debido en cualquier caso que el tendero no enga e a un cliente inexperto donde existe gran concurrencia el comerciante inteligente se ajusta a esta norma estableciendo un precio general fijo para todo el mundo de forma que un ni o puede comprarle en iguales condiciones que cualquier otra persona
4551715 sup ngase que alguien pretende que su inclinaci n voluptuosa es totalmente irresistible para l cuando se le presentan el objeto deseado y la ocasi n si se levantara una horca en la casa donde se le presenta esa ocasi n para ser colgado en ella inmediatamente despu s de haber gozado de su voluptuosidad no dominar a entonces su inclinaci n no es necesario pensar mucho para saber qu contestar a pero preguntadle si amenaz ndole con la misma pena de muerte en el acto su pr ncipe le obligara a dar un falso testimonio contra un hombre honrado a quien ste quisiera perder con pretextos aparentes considerar a posible vencer su amor a la vida por m s grande que fuera tal vez no se decida a asegurar si lo har a o no pero confesar sin reserva que es posible para l por lo tanto juzga que puede hacer algo porque tiene conciencia de que debe hacerlo y conoce que tiene en s la libertad que de lo contrario ser a desconocida para l si no fuera por la ley moral
4551716 inter s que se toma la raz n en su acci n sin obrar por inter s
4551717 revela solamente dependencia de la voluntad de los principios de la raz n
4551718 dependencia de los principios de la misma en beneficio de la inclinaci n
4551719 el deber es la necesidad de una acci n por respeto a la ley
4551720 sostiene que el valor tico de una vida su xito en el sentido cr tico depende enteramente del valor de sus consecuencias para el resto del mundo y es medido por l
4551721 al valor que puedan tener las situaciones objetivas del mundo
4551722 que la vida es el reto m s importante y global al que nos enfrentamos y que nuestros intereses cr ticos consisten en los logros los acontecimientos y las experiencias que dan testimonio significativo de que hemos superado bien ese reto
4551723 en el modelo del desaf o el autointer s cr tico y la igualdad pol tica van de la mano
4551724 vivir bien tiene una dimensi n social y no vivo tan bien si vivo en una comunidad en la que otros consideran que mis esfuerzos por llevar una buena vida son empe os que carecen de importancia
4551725 obra s lo seg n aquella m xima de la que al mismo tiempo puedas querer que se convierta en norma universal
4551726 obra tal como si la m xima de tu acci n hubiera de convertirse por tu voluntad en ley universal de la naturaleza
4551727 obra de modo que en cada caso te valgas de la humanidad tanto en tu persona como en la persona de todo otro como fin nunca s lo como medio
4551728 no realizar ninguna acci n por ninguna otra m xima sino por aquella que pueda al mismo tiempo ser una ley general y por lo tanto de forma tal que la voluntad mediante su m xima pueda al mismo tiempo considerarse como legisladora universal
4551729 el juicio de gusto no es un juicio de conocimiento un juicio l gico sino est tico un juicio cuyo motivo determinante s lo puede ser subjetivo
4551730 actitud de quienes al crear o valorar obras literarias y art sticas conceden importancia primordial a la belleza anteponi ndola a los aspectos intelectuales religiosos morales sociales etc
4551731 la ciencia de todos los principios de la sensibilidad a priori la llamo est tica trascendental
4551732 los alemanes son los nicos que emplean hoy la palabra est tica para denominar lo que otros denominan cr tica del gusto
4551733 las m ximas que del entendimiento humano com n vamos a exponer son las siguientes 1o pensar por s mismo 2o pensar poni ndose en lugar de otro y 3o pensar de acuerdo consigo mismo
4551734 un hombre abandonado en una isla desierta no engalanar a para s solo su caba a ni su persona ni buscar a flores y menos plantar a para adornarse con ellas antes bien s lo en sociedad se le ocurre ser no s lo hombre sino tambi n a su manera hombre cort s el principio de la civilizaci n pues de tal se juzga quien desea y sabe participar su agrado a los dem s y a quien no satisface un objeto si no puede compartir con otros el placer que le cause
4551735 el cielo estrellado que est sobre m y la ley moral que hay en m
4551736 dos cosas llenan el esp ritu con renovados y crecientes respeto y admiraci n cuanto m s reiterada y persistentemente se ocupa de ellas la reflexi n el cielo estrellado que est sobre m y la ley moral que hay en m
4551737 aquellas culturas que hasta ahora han compartido menos el programa de la modernizaci n y la empresa de la racionalizaci n rigurosa impuesta tanto a la econom a como a la vida social y a la misma existencia individual si lo moderno estuvo guiado por las culturas anglosajonas no podr a la posmodernidad ser la poca de las culturas latinas
4551738 una posmodernidad que se realizara como forma de racionalidad social m s ligera menos l bregamente dominada por el realismo de la raz n calculadora y de la asc tica capitalista burocr tica o revolucionario leninista propone una utop a digna del m ximo respeto y capaz quiz de estimular tambi n nuestro empe o tico pol tico
4551739 sta es la caracter stica respecto de la cual todos somos iguales todos estamos en la misma situaci n y todos tenemos el poder de pensar por nosotros mismos respecto a la pregunta c mo vivir
4551740 nuestras im genes morales est n en un proceso de desarrollo y reforma
4551741 mi padre ten a muchos libros y me permit a leerlos a mi gusto
4551742 acerca del uso tico pragm tico y moral de la raz n pr ctica
4551743 por un concepto cr tico de libertad en la filosof a pr ctica de kant
4551744 la herencia kantiana de la tica discursiva y la paz
4551745 el papel de la identidad en la constituci n de la moralidad
4551746 es evidente que la fecundidad de la fenomenolog a no procede de aquellos que contra la investigaci n cient fica del hombre retoman por su cuenta los argumentos insulsos e irrisorios de la teolog a y de la filosof a espiritualista la riqueza de la fenomenolog a su lado positivo es su esfuerzo por volver a aprehender al hombre mismo por debajo de los esquemas objetivistas de que no puede sino revestirlo la ciencia antropol gica y evidentemente sobre esta base debe discutirse con ella la recuperaci n comprensiva de los datos neuro y psico patol gicos etnol gicos y sociol gicos ling sticos hist ricos etc en la medida en que no constituye ni un grosero oscurantismo ni un eclecticismo carente de solidez te rica responde bastante bien a las exigencias de una filosof a concreta
4551747 la urgencia ardiente de formaci n el esfuerzo por la reforma filos fica del sistema 81 en husserl edmund
4551748 la posibilidad de una realizaci n continuamente progresiva de la idea de eternidad de la humanidad no del hombre individuo
4551749 el orden tico del mundo como principio creador del mundo
4551750 el dominio de esta filosof a la del idealismo sobre los esp ritus fue reemplazada por el dominio de las nuevas ciencias exactas y de la cultura t cnica determinada por ellas
4551751 qu inoportuna es la farisaica autojustificaci n de las ciencias exactas qu injustos los juicios despreciativos acerca de la filosof a por parte de quienes han sido educados en las ciencias rigurosas de nuestro tiempo
4551752 un tiempo de renovaci n de todas las fuentes ideales de fortaleza que ya desde antes flu an en el mismo pueblo y desde lo m s profundo de su esp ritu conservando toda su fuerza salvadora
4551753 y puede ser definitiva para los fines superiores de la vida personal y debe serlo
4551754 que al obrar es libre a saber ciudadano libre en una sociedad destinada a la libertad
4551755 comprendimos escribe a arnold metzger esta actitud radical que est totalmente decidida a no mirar ni llevar la vida como un negocio
4551756 lo que ha puesto al descubierto la guerra es la indescriptible miseria no s lo moral y religiosa sino filos fica de la humanidad
4551757 todo ciencia arte y cuanto siempre ha podido ser considerado como bien espiritual absoluto se convierte en objeto de apolog tica nacionalista de mercado y de mercanc a nacionalista de instrumento de poder
4551758 la fraseolog a y la argumentaci n pol tica nacionalista y social tienen tanto y m s poder que la argumentaci n de la m s humanitaria de las sabidur as
4551759 renovaci n es el clamor generalizado en nuestra actualidad lamentable y lo es en el mbito general de la cultura europea la guerra que la ha desolado desde el a o 1914 y que desde 1918 s lo ha cambiado los medios de coacci n militar por los m s refinados de las torturas espirituales y de las necesidades econ micas moralmente depravantes ha develado la falsedad interior la falta de sentido de esta cultura y precisamente esta develaci n significa la interrupci n de su impulso motriz
4551760 por cultura no comprendemos otra cosa que el conjunto de producciones que tienen lugar en las actividades continuas de los hombres colectivizados y que tienen su existencia espiritual permanente en la unidad de la conciencia de la comunidad y que su tradici n sigue conservando sobre la base de su corporalizaci n f sica y de su expresi n que desprende a dichas producciones de su autor originario son aptas de ser experimentadas en su sentido espiritual para su comprensi n ulterior por cada cual en el futuro siempre ellas pueden nuevamente devenir los puntos de irradiaci n de efectos espirituales sobre nuevas generaciones en el marco de una continuidad hist rica y justamente all tiene su modo esencialmente propio de existencia objetiva lo que el t tulo cultura abarca y que funciona por otro lado como fuente estable de la colectivizaci n
4551761 filosof a escribe husserl es el rgano de una nueva forma de existencia hist rica de la humanidad de un modo de ser desde el esp ritu de la autonom a la forma originaria de la autonom a es la de la autorresponsabilidad cient fica la forma originaria de las culturas que proceden de este esp ritu son las ciencias a su vez miembros dependientes de una ciencia plena y total la filosof a la autorresponsabilidad filos fica se realiza necesariamente en la comunidad de los que filosofan consider ndolo en principio la comunidad filos fica y la filosof a son el protofen meno y al mismo tiempo la fuerza operante en continua vida la cual partiendo de la mera internacionalidad por la fuerza ha creado y cultiva una totalmente nueva internacionalidad a saber una uni n mediante el esp ritu de autonom a
4551762 el tecnificarse y el especializarse de la ciencia si falta un movimiento en contra hacia la clarificaci n de sentido hasta lo m s profundo y englobante el universo filos fico es decadencia
4551763 el hombre moderno de hoy d a no ve en la ciencia y en la nueva cultura formada por ella como el hombre moderno de la ilustraci n la autoobjetivaci n de la raz n humana ni la funci n universal creada por la humanidad para hacer posible una vida verdaderamente satisfactoria una vida individual y social basada en la raz n pr ctica
4551764 podemos adoptar ahora una actitud por dem s cr tica y esc ptica respecto de una cultura cient fica convertida en asunto hist rico pero no podemos abandonarla sin m s simplemente porque no podamos comprenderla cabalmente ni dirigirla mediante esa comprensi n en otras palabras porque seamos incapaces de explicar racionalmente su sentido y de determinar su alcance verdadero dentro del cual podamos justificar y realizar ese sentido en un trabajo progresivo ya que no nos basta la alegr a de crear una t cnica te rica de descubrir teor as con las que pueden hacerse tantas cosas tiles y ganar la admiraci n del mundo puesto que no podemos separar la aut ntica condici n humana de la vida vivida con radical responsabilidad propia y por ende tampoco podemos separar la propia responsabilidad cient fica de la totalidad de responsabilidades de la vida humana en general debemos colocarnos por encima de toda esa vida y de toda esa tradici n cultural y buscar nosotros mismos individualmente y en comunidad por medio de reflexiones radicales las posibilidades y necesidades ltimas a partir de las cuales podamos tomar posici n acerca de lo que existe efectivamente juzg ndolo valor ndolo actuando sobre ello
4551765 la crisis de la existencia europea tiene solamente dos salidas o la decadencia de europa en un distanciamiento de su propio sentido racional de la vida el hundimiento en la hostilidad al esp ritu y en la barbarie o el renacimiento de europa por el esp ritu de la filosof a mediante un hero smo de la raz n 87 que triunfe definitivamente sobre el naturalismo el peligro m s grande que amenaza a europa es el cansancio
4551766 en nuestra penuria vital o mos esta ciencia no tiene nada que decirnos
4551767 hay entonces un enlace de voluntades que constituye una unidad de ellas sin que se trate de una organizaci n imperialista de voluntades se trata m s bien de una especie de voluntad central en la que confluyen las voluntades particulares a la cual se someten voluntariamente todos y se consideran como particulares sus funcionarios
4551768 aqu podr amos tambi n hablar de una unidad comunista de voluntades en oposici n a una unidad imperialista
4551769 si la comunidad filos fica era por as decir comunista y la idea conductora no era manejada por ninguna voluntad social englobante as ahora la comunidad correspondiente la de los sacerdotes es imperialista dominada por una voluntad unitaria
4551770 husserl ve como tarea de la filosof a ante todo la realizaci n de la certeza de s del hombre respecto de su tema que es el mundo
4551771 hay coincidencia en que el ente en el sentido de lo que ud
4551772 el mundo de la vida como tema de la fenomenolog a
4551773 la primera irrupci n de este a priori universal de correlaci n entre objeto de experiencia y formas de daci n durante la elaboraci n de mis logischen urtersuchungen aproximadamente en el a o 1898 me sacudi tan profundamente que desde entonces toda mi vida de trabajo estuvo dominada por la tarea de una elaboraci n sistem tica de este a priori de correlaci n
4551774 la actitud fenomenol gica total implicada en la correlaci n y la epoj que le pertenece est n llamadas a provocar una completa mutaci n personal que cabr a comparar en principio con una conversi n religiosa pero que por encima de ello esconde en s la m xima mutaci n existencial que se encomienda a la humanidad en tanto que humanidad
4551775 el factum es el a priori suena contradictorio pero es aut ntico descubrimiento fenomenol gico el a priori es lo primero por su naturaleza por su esencia por su modo de ser y qu puede ser esto 109 slide 110 la fenomenolog a y las ciencias sociales primero sino precisamente la conciencia de mundo es decir la intencionalidad ese factum originario
4551776 toda intuici n en que se da algo originariamente es un fundamento de derecho del conocimiento todo lo que se nos brinda originariamente por decirlo as en su realidad corp rea en la intuici n hay que tomarlo simplemente como se da pero tambi n dentro de los l mites en que se da
4551777 la conciencia tiene una estructura teleol gica universal una inclinaci n a la raz n y a n una tendencia continua hacia ella tiende en efecto a comprobar la correcci n
4551778 mundo en que siempre hemos vivido y que ofrece el terreno para toda funci n conocitiva y para toda determinaci n cient fica
4551779 terreno univesal de la creencia predada para toda experiencia de objetos individuales
4551780 este terreno universal siempre est presupuesto por toda praxis tanto por la praxis de vida como por la praxis teor tica del conocimiento
4551781 en la medida en que el mundo circundante intuitivo meramente subjetivo fue olvidado en la tem tica cient fica fue olvidado el propio sujeto operante y el cient fico no lleg a convertirse en tema
4551782 la naci n de la grecia antigua hacia los siglos vii y vi a
4551783 la vida natural se caracteriza como vivir ingenuo directamente orientado hacia el mundo un mundo que como horizonte universal se halla en cierta manera siempre presente a la conciencia pero que no es enfocado tem ticamente
4551784 vida atenta contin a husserl siempre es un estar dirigido a esto o aquello dirigido a ello como a un fin o un medio como a algo relevante o irrelevante a algo interesante o indiferente a algo privado o p blico a lo diariamente necesario o a algo nuevo que aparece
4551785 la filosof a en la crisis de la humanidad europea
4551786 son necesarios motivos especiales para que quien est en tal horizonte mundano se oriente y lo convierta de alguna manera en tem tico tomando en ello un inter s persistente
4551787 orientado as el hombre contempla ante todo la diversidad de las naciones las propias y las ajenas cada una con su mundo circundante propio considerado con sus tradiciones sus dioses demonios potencias m ticas como el mundo absolutamente evidente y real
4551788 mas ahora debemos prestar atenci n a los malentendidos y escr pulos seguramente muy apremiantes que seg n mi opini n derivan su fuerza sugestiva de los prejuicios de moda y de sus fraseolog as lo que aqu ha sido expuesto no es una rehabilitaci n precisamente en nuestro tiempo 117 slide 118 la fenomenolog a y las ciencias sociales muy poco oportuna del racionalismo de la ilustracionitis aufk rerei del intelectualismo que se pierde en teor as divorciadas de la realidad con sus consecuencias necesariamente desastrosas de la huera man a cultural del snobismo intelectualista no significa esto querer volver otra vez al error fatal de que la ciencia hace sabio al hombre que la ciencia est llamada a crear una genuina humanidad feliz y due a de su destino qui n tomar a n en serio hoy en d a tales pensamientos

4551791 se trata ntegramente de problemas que proceden de la ingenuidad en virtud de la cual la ciencia objetivista toma lo que ella denomina el mundo objetivo por el universo de todo lo existente sin considerar que la subjetividad creadora de la ciencia no puede hallar cabida en ninguna ciencia objetiva al que ha sido formado en la ciencia natural le parece evidente que todo lo meramente subjetivo debe ser eliminado y que el m todo cient fico natural determina en t rminos objetivos lo que halla su figuraci n en los modos de representaci n subjetivos as pues busca tambi n para lo ps quico lo objetivamente verdadero al mismo tiempo se supone con ello que lo subjetivo eliminado por el f sico ha de ser investigado precisamente como algo ps quico por la psicolog a y naturalmente por una psicolog a psicof sica pero el investigador de la naturaleza no se da cuenta que el fundamento permanente de su trabajo mental subjetivo es el mundo circundante vital que constantemente est presupuesto como fondo como el terreno de la actividad sobre el cual s lo tienen sentido sus preguntas y sus m todos de pensamiento ahora bien d nde se somete a la cr tica y al esclarecimiento la enorme adquisici n metodol gica que lleva desde el mundo circundante intuido a las idealizaciones de la matem tica y a la interpretaci n del mundo circundante como ser objetivo la revoluci n de einstein concierne a las f rmulas en las cuales es tratada la physis idealizada e ingenuamente objetiva pero c mo las f rmulas en general c mo la objetivaci n matem tica en general cobra sentido sobre el mundo de la vida y del mundo circundante intuido de ello nada se nos dice y as einstein no reforma ni el espacio ni el tiempo en los cuales se desarrolla nuestra vida real concreta

4551808 todos los fil sofos ling sticos hablan acerca del mundo por medio de un hablar sobre el lenguaje apropiado ste es el giro ling stico la t ctica fundamental a manera de m todo sobre el que est n en acuerdo los fil sofos del lenguaje ordinario e ideal
4551809 nadie como wittgenstein fue consciente de los l mites del lenguaje aunque se empe ara en vaciar la realidad de racionalidad ese continente del silencio o del olvido
4551810 los l mites de mi lenguaje significan los l mites de mi mundo 5
4551811 la filosof a tal como nosotros utilizamos la expresi n es una lucha contra la fascinaci n que ejercen sobre nosotros las formas de expresi n quiero que recuerden ustedes que las palabras tienen los significados que nosotros les hemos dado y nosotros les damos significados mediante explicaciones
4551812 lo que hay que aceptar lo dado podr amos decir son formas de vida127 imaginar un lenguaje significa imaginar una forma de vida128 la expresi n juego de lenguaje debe poner de relieve aqu que hablar el lenguaje forma parte de una actividad o de una forma de vida ten a la vista la multiplicidad de juegos de lenguaje en estos ejemplos y en otros

4551815 los participantes en la interacci n no pueden ejecutar actos de habla que tengan efectos coordinadores sin suponer a todos los implicados un mundo de la vida intersubjetivamente compartido cuyos hilos afluyen en cada caso a la situaci n de habla y c ntricamente anclado en el propio cuerpo
4551816 trazar unos l mites al pensamiento o mejor no al pensamiento sino a la expresi n de los pensamientos porque para trazar unos l mites al pensamiento tendr amos que ser capaces de pensar ambos lados de ese l mite y tendr amos que ser capaces de pensar lo que no se puede pensar
4551817 de lo que no se puede hablar mejor es callarse
4551818 tengo que destacar pues que mis an lisis del juego o del lenguaje est n pensados como puramente fenomenol gicos
4551819 ste es el motivo por el que el concepto de los juegos ling sticos de l wittgenstein me result muy natural cuando tuve noticia de l
4551820 el concepto del juego extra do por m hace decenios de la esfera subjetiva del instinto l dico schiller para utilizarlo en la cr tica de la distinci n est tica implica un problema ontol gico
4551821 al hablar podemos referirnos a un objeto se al ndolo
4551822 nuestro error es buscar una explicaci n all donde deber amos ver los hechos como protofen menos es decir donde deber amos decir ste es el juego de lenguaje que se est jugando
4551823 llamar tambi n juego de lenguaje al todo formado por el lenguaje y las acciones con las que est entretejido
4551824 el proceso de nuestro juego de lenguaje se basa siempre en una presuposici n impl cita no existe una presuposici n donde existe una duda y la duda puede faltar por completo la duda tiene un final
4551825 el g nero de certeza es el g nero de juego de lenguaje
4551826 quien hace tal pregunta se olvida de que la duda sobre la existencia s lo tiene lugar en un juego de lenguaje
4551827 la certeza por as decirlo un tono en el que se constata c mo son las cosas pero del tono no se sigue que uno est justificado
4551828 quien quisiera dudar de todo ni siquiera llegar a a dudar el mismo juego de la duda presupone ya la certeza
4551829 el ni o aprende al creer al adulto la duda viene despu s de la creencia
4551830 no identifico ciertamente mi sensaci n mediante criterios sino que uso la misma expresi n
4551831 no se puede atribuir ser al elemento pues si no fuese no se podr a siquiera nombrarlo y as no se podr a decir nada en absoluto de l
4551832 si llamamos a una tal tabla la expresi n de una regla del juego de lenguaje se puede decir que lo que llamamos regla de un juego de lenguaje puede tener muy diferentes papeles en el juego

4551834 la filosof a que piensa encontrar descanso en s misma en alguna verdad no tiene que ver nada con la teor a cr tica
4551835 comunicaci n y emancipaci n reflexiones sobre el giro ling stico de la teor a cr tica
4551836 la lucha contra el liberalismo en la concepci n totalitaria del estado
4551837 la teor a cr tica de la sociedad es en su totalidad un nico juicio de existencia desarrollado este juicio afirma dicho en t rminos generales que la forma b sica de la econom a de mercanc as hist ricamente dada sobre la cual reposa la historia moderna encierra en s misma los antagonismos internos y externos de la poca los renueva constantemente de una manera agudizada y que tras un per odo de ascenso de desarrollo de fuerzas humanas de emancipaci n del individuo tras una fabulosa expansi n del poder del hombre sobre la naturaleza termina impidiendo la continuaci n de ese desarrollo y lleva a la humanidad hacia una nueva barbarie
4551838 afirma no debe ser as los hombres pueden cambiar el ser las circunstancias para ello est n ahora presentes
4551839 la falla fundamental de todo el materialismo precedente incluyendo el de feuerbach reside en que s lo capta la cosa la realidad lo sensible bajo la forma de objeto o de contemplaci n no como actividad humana sensorial como pr ctica no de un modo subjetivo de ah que el lado activo fuese desarrollado de un modo absoluto en contraposici n al materialismo por el idealismo el cual naturalmente no conoce la actividad real sensorial en cuanto tal
4551840 es en la pr ctica donde el hombre debe demostrar la verdad es decir la realidad y el poder la terrenalidad de su pensamiento

4551845 la transformaci n de los poderes relaciones personales en materiales por obra de la divisi n del trabajo no puede revocarse quit ndose de la cabeza la idea general acerca de ella sino haciendo que los individuos sometan de nuevo a su mando estos poderes materiales y supriman la divisi n del trabajo y esto no es posible hacerlo sin la comunidad solamente dentro de la comunidad con otros tiene todo individuo los medios necesarios para desarrollar sus dotes en todos los sentidos solamente dentro de la comunidad es posible por tanto la libertad personal en los substitutivos de la comunidad que hasta ahora han existido en el estado etc la libertad personal s lo exist a para los individuos desarrollados dentro de las relaciones de la clase dominante y s lo trat ndose de individuos de esta clase la aparente comunidad en que se han asociado hasta ahora los individuos ha cobrado siempre una existencia propia e independiente frente a ellos y por tratarse de la asociaci n de una clase en contra de otra no s lo era al mismo tiempo una comunidad puramente ilusoria para la clase dominada sino tambi n una nueva traba dentro de la comunidad real y verdadera los individuos adquieren al mismo tiempo su libertad al asociarse y por medio de la asociaci n

4551858 estamos tomando una predecisi n en favor de ese concepto de racionalidad cognitivo instrumental

4551863 la escritura y la argumentaci n como formalizaci n de la investigaci n
4551864 c mo pueden ser abiertas sin que se lastime su propio sentido de racionalidad las esferas de la ciencia de la moral y del arte que se encuentran como encapsuladas en formas de culturas de expertos c mo se puede relacionar de nuevo estas esferas con las tradiciones empobrecidas del mundo de la vida de modo que las reas disociadas de la raz n vuelvan a encontrar en la pr ctica comunicativa cotidiana un equilibrio
4551865 la filosof a podr a por lo menos ayudar a animar el juego equilibrado que ha llegado a total quietud entre lo cognitivo instrumental lo moral pr ctico y lo est tico expresivo como quien pone de nuevo en movimiento un m vil que se ha trabado persistentemente

4551868 iii tica del discurso notas sobre un programa de fundamentaci n
4551869 el objeto de estos lugares comunes es tratar de mantener frente a nuestras mentes algo que f cilmente se olvida cuando estamos comprometidos en filosof a especialmente en nuestro fr o y contempor neo estilo a saber lo que significa estar realmente envuelto en relaciones interpersonales ordinarias ya sea desde las m s ntimas hasta las m s casuales
4551870 la actitud o gama de actitudes de estar envuelto o participar en una relaci n humana y lo que deber a llamarse la actitud objetiva o gama de actitudes hacia otro ser humano adoptar la actitud objetiva hacia otro ser humano es verlo tal vez como un objeto de pol tica social como un sujeto al que en el amplio sentido del t rmino deber a someterse a tratamiento la actitud objetiva podr a ser emocionalmente matizada de muchas maneras pero no de todas no puede incluir el rango de sentimientos de reacci n y actitudes que pertenecen al compromiso y la participaci n con otros en relaciones humanas interpersonales no puede incluir resentimiento gratitud perd n angustia o la clase de amor que algunas veces dos adultos dicen sentir rec procamente el uno por el otro si su actitud hacia alguien es completamente objetiva entonces aunque usted pudiera pelear con l usted no podr a re ir con l y aunque pudiera hablar con l inclusive negociar usted no podr a razonar con l usted puede a lo sumo pretender que ri e o que razone con l
4551871 es claro que los sentimientos tienen una significaci n para la justificaci n moral de formas de acci n semejante a la que tienen las percepciones para la explicaci n te rica de hechos
4551872 en lugar de proponer a todos los dem s una m xima como v lida y que quiero que sea ley general tengo que presentarles a todos los dem s mi m xima con el objeto de que comprueben discursivamente su pretensi n de universalidad

4552035 i could not interpret that other than a deliberate intake
4552036 it is regretful for ngan thuong because she is an athlete trained in china since her childhood and she has seized many achievements for vietnam s gymnastics
4552037 we do not know why thuong has such a thought to have a slimmer body so she made that mistake
4552038 my interpretation is that it is a problem resulting from poor information of the athlete not enough knowledge what to take
4552039 i know i m going to win for sure otherwise i d be sitting at home watching it on tv

4552049 it doesn t matter if the victories are easy or difficult the important thing is the gold medal
4552050 i thought the team s target should be around 270 making 200 on my own wouldn t have been easy but i am happy with the team s performance
4552051 there s always the motivation to score runs whether you miss out on tests or you not you always want to perform at your best the pitch was a little double paced and the ball wasn t coming on my intention was to spend time in the middle because i hadn t played for a while
4552052 murali and mendis will be different this was also an international class attack the knock gave me a lot of confidence i had prepared well before coming here and i hope i can continue this form i prepared keeping in mind the conditions in sri lanka the targets of the team and it s nice that i succeeded immediately in the practice match
4552053 it s better now so hopefully i ll be fully fit before the first match on monday winning this match was very important because we were the favourites the conditions in dambulla will be different from here and it s important we play according to the conditions and not to people s expectations
4552054 political equations have undergone a sea change after 2004 and therefore chief minister karunanidhi should weigh his political options more carefully

4552081 the thing we must remember is that god chose to use todd to stir up the hunger in the body of christ therefore as i prayed the lord took me to the life of samson he is a mystery he had a nazarite vow on his life yet he had many character flaws his character flaws did not stop god from using him i think this is the biggest misunderstanding that the body has when it comes to the anointing that is why you see anointed men and women being used so mightily by the lord and then falling into sexual sin or monetary impropriety

4552105 as for the one who is weak in faith welcome him but not to quarrel over opinions one person believes he may eat anything while the weak person eats only vegetables let not the one who eats despise the one who abstains and let not the one who abstains pass judgment on the one who eats for god has welcomed him who are you to pass judgment on the servant of another it is before his own master that he stands or falls and he will be upheld for the lord is able to make him stand
4552106 one person esteems one day as better than another while another esteems all days alike each one should be fully convinced in his own mind the one who observes the day observes it in honor of the lord the one who eats eats in honor of the lord since he gives thanks to god while the one who abstains abstains in honor of the lord and gives thanks to god for none of us lives to himself and none of us dies to himself for if we live we live to the lord and if we die we die to the lord so then whether we live or whether we die we are the lords for to this end christ died and lived again that he might be lord both of the dead and of the living
4552107 why do you pass judgment on your brother or you why do you despise your brother for we will all stand before the judgment seat of god for it is written

4552142 there is a tendency to make fun of people who get involved in these sorts of things brad went there builds houses he can do a lot of other things with his time he and angie really put their money where their mouth is im always very impressed by them
4552143 this is just incorrect i was never his agent or manager
4552144 theyre trying to take my salary and say i was the agent i wasnt
4552145 he has made gratuitous ridiculous and outrageous statements about his former clients mr krutonog was fired more than two years ago after he refused to work on the series

4552156 combining the lithography techniques traditionally used to pattern microelectronics with novel self assembling materials called block copolymers
4552157 initial causes of the numerous problems during the 2007 election and its myriad failures were the actions of then minister of internal affairs rien morris and contributing causes includes the actions or inactions of the psc and chief electoral office carl alik
4552158 the psc further doomed the 2007 election by allowing former minister morris to interfere with the psc selection process and by ignoring its own selection committees recommendation that laju sawej be appointed as the chief electoral officer
4552159 once the improper selection was made chief electoral officer carl alik insured through his incompetence and inexperience that the 2007 election would be a debacle of the worst magnitude

4552268 no one really knew how to make a record when i started
4552269 you simply went into the studio turned on the mike and said play
4552270 in the early sessions i just sat there watching ertegun while i was cowering in fright
4552271 but as time went on we proved to be a very successful team we went on the road together we hung out together
4552272 wrote many of the songs in the early days and he drew upon his knowledge of jazz and the blues because songs always have to have a source this is not to say that there is not great originality
4552273 when it came to the studio you could say the two of us were joined at the hip
4552274 among my favorite sessions i feel the things we did together were dynamite
4552275 i was only familiar with warhols more popular and commercial prints
4552276 but these photographs capture a unique and personal glimpse into warhols world
4552277 i feel extremely fortunate to be able to have this valuable opportunity to study warhols original photographs with my senior thesis my in depth research should provide a foundation for curating and shaping the exhibition for the spring
4552278 we are greatly appreciative of the warhol foundations gift the photographs provide a rare opportunity to view and study warhols creative process and work the photographs have already sparked much interest among our faculty staff and students
4552279 warhols profound and frank engagement with the personality in front of the lens his eye for detail and his compulsive desire to document the world around him
4552280 a good picture is one thats in focus and of a famous person doing something unfamous
4552281 i think its being killed by lack of originality most publishers are pushing crappy clones quickly made for little money and thats having a detrimental effect on the public because the public doesnt know what to choose doesnt find any good titles so it tends to go to established known titles and games nintendo games basically but its not necessarily the publishers fault i think distribution is largely responsible for that because retailers have basically selection companies that decide what theyre buying and how many quantities theyre taking from the publishers and how theyre exposing it on the racks
4552282 i think his view was that warner music should be compensated the way they might for a performance on itunes but this is an entirely different business that is very technically complex were going to favour those publishers that recognize and appreciate how much we can add value to their artists were introducing a whole new group of artists to new audiences that is resulting in their itunes downloads being exponentially higher than they would otherwise be as well as new album sales and new merchandising opportunities
4552283 on friday we had a lot of support saturday was quiet which made it difficult but on sunday afternoon there were loads of people and the players went from playing at a snails pace to probably harder than most matches the adrenalin was pumping and the play so intense that everyone was going for every ball and every goal was going in

4552385 we cannot tolerate the democratic process in which a terrorist muslim probably born in indonesia or africa or somewhere whose real name is obviously barry soretos and doesnt even qualify to run for president under the constitution slayed our goddess hrc in the primaries and expects to get away with it were not angry or resentful even though we didnt get our way and were not unduly obsessed as our detractors claim

4552394 merrill will have to be able to say that the uk subsidiary was the owner of those securities
4552395 it does not matter where the derivatives unit is based or where the trades were executed
4552396 the only thing that matters is who was the owner of the securities
4552397 it obviously makes commercial sense though it would be subject to certain legal and tax law restrictions no company wants the mismatch by losing money on one unit while paying tax on another profitable operation

4552410 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4552411 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4552412 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4552413 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4552414 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4552415 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4552416 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4552417 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4552418 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4552419 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4552420 i can tell you what they better not be doing
4552421 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4552422 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4552423 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4552424 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4552425 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4552426 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4552427 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again

4552430 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4552431 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4552432 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4552433 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4552434 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4552435 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4552436 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4552437 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4552438 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4552439 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4552440 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4552441 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4552442 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4552443 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4552444 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4552445 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4552446 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4552447 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4552448 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4552449 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4552450 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4552451 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4552452 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4552453 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4552454 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4552455 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4552456 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4552457 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4552458 after consulting with investigators it became clear to me that they are pursuing certain technical lines of investigation which could be severely compromised if too much information is divulged to the public at this stage
4552459 very shortly we will be able to provide more information as it pertains to arrests but now for the benefit of the investigation it is more prudent if the information is kept until those lines of the investigation are fully exhausted
4552460 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4552461 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4552462 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4552463 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4552464 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4552465 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4552466 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4552467 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4552468 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4552469 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4552470 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4552471 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4552472 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4552473 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4552474 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4552475 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4552476 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4552477 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4552478 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4552479 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4552480 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4552481 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4552482 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4552483 recognizes an individual who has advocated for the future of the lgbt community and lives with the vision that investing in todays potential will produce a brighter tomorrow
4552484 recognizes a corporation or organization that champions respect and inclusion of the lgbt community and operates with the vision that investing in todays potential will produce a brighter tomorrow
4552485 not only does kristin chenoweth lead a phenomenally successful career as an actress and singer she is an outspoken supporter of the lgbt community often taking unpopular stances with conservative media outlets and it is with great pleasure that we will present her with the point courage award as a public figure with the integrity to speak her convictions she is an extremely visible source of hope and inspiration to our current and potential point scholars
4552486 i am deeply honored to receive the point courage award through point foundations scholarships and community the organization empowers its scholars and gives them the support and encouragement to excel both academically and personally the knowledge i gained as a student provided me with the essential tools to lay the foundation for my career i believe deeply in the power of education and applaud all students who continue to pursue their educational goals in the face of obstacles

4552490 my lord this woman and i dwell in the same house and i gave birth to a child while with her in the house on the third day after i gave birth she also gave birth we live together there is no outsider with us in the house only the two of us were there the son of this woman died during the night because she lay upon him she arose during the night and took my son from my side while i was asleep and lay him in her bosom and her dead son she laid in my bosom when i got up in the morning to nurse my son behold he was dead but when i observed him later on in the morning i realized that he was not my son to whom i had given birth
4552491 it is not so my son is the live one and your son is the dead one
4552492 it is not so your son is the dead one and my son is the living one
4552493 this woman 2 claims my son is the live one and your son is the dead one and this woman 1 claims your son is the dead one and my son is the living one
4552494 cut the living child in two and give half to one and half to the other
4552495 please my lord give her the living child and do not kill it
4552496 give her 2 the living child and do not kill it for she is his mother
4552497 bismillah as salaamu alaikum brother you are soooooooo vain btw i like your default pic
4552498 i think one of the great things to come out of this week and the week ahead were only halfway through the olympics is that people will continue to understand how important the company is to ge
4552499 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4552500 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4552501 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4552502 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4552503 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4552504 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4552505 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4552506 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4552507 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4552508 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4552509 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4552510 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4552511 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4552512 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4552513 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4552514 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4552515 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4552516 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4552517 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4552518 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4552519 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4552520 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money

4552596 he who is awake to this world is actually more asleep his wakefulness is worse than his sleep when our soul is not awake with god our wakefulness is like being in a prison
4552597 how can it be that you rarely come in front of the caravan while i am always forced to walk in front

4552615 pemerintah nampaknya berharap banyak dari kampanye sunset policy tempo hari kalau perekonomian rakyat kuat alias tak bermasalah target kenaikannya bahkan bisa lebih besar tetapi dengan kelesuan ekonomi di dalam negeri sekarang target itu bakal sulit diwujudkan
4552616 dan tampaknya pemerintah akan sulit untuk tidak menerima permohonan pengampunan pajak
4552617 itu artinya saat ini banyak pemodal belum berniat merealisasikan usahanya hingga pilpres usai berarti potensi penerimaan pajak akan mengecil

4552620 sekarang rakyat untuk mendapat dan menilai si kandidiat tidak mesti harus berkumpul yang sudah tentu cara seperti itu menyita waktu aktivitasnya tetapi dengan bersantai atau sambil beraktivitas dengan menonton televisi atau radio mereka akan mendapat informasi program yang disampaikan kandidat tersebut

4552652 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4552653 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4552654 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4552655 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4552660 but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of god deceitfully but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every mans conscience in the sight of god
4552661 by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every mans conscience in the sight of god
4552662 the husband and i both liked the cantaloupe milk we also both agreed that it was better over ice itd also be really great with a shot of vodka in it but im not even going there right now the flavor is delicate and refreshing exactly what we needed on this hot southern california morning
4552663 the effects of war remain long after our brave men and women return home to their families and friends and we at home cannot come close to comprehending what our service members have seen in the battle zone
4552664 but what we can do is make sure that help is available so they dont have to turn to alcohol or drugs the illinois warrior assistance program helps returning veterans suffering from substance abuse problems depression or ptsd get the confidential help they need day or night
4552665 in the military you are trained to be physically mentally and emotionally tough but the thing that our service members need to know is that mental and psychological wounds can be just as debilitating as external physical injuries and they need to seek help for these wounds
4552666 i want to urge all veterans who are having difficulty transition back to everyday life and may be self medicating with alcohol or drugs to call illinois warrior assistance program
4552667 our country owes a debt of gratitude that we can never repay to our veterans and their families supporting these brave men and women and their families when they return home requires action not just empty rhetoric
4552668 i will proudly honor the wounded warriors workplace initiative pledge and i urge dick durbin to do the same
4552669 dick durbin can personally help our veterans and their families by honoring this pledge
4552670 its one thing to talk about protecting veterans and its another thing to actually do something about it
4552671 our illinois veterans and their families deserve better than career politicians making empty promises about their health care benefits and jobs instead of rewarding government jobs as political giveaways politicians should honor our veterans by implementing the wounded warriors workplace initiative
4552672 while i greatly appreciate the efforts of fema in delivering the needed federal assistance to people following several other disasters in illinois over the past year the people in southern illinois who are most in need of disaster assistance that can only be provided by fema continue to wait
4552673 our state is still waiting for a response to the appeal and request that i made nearly three months ago i urge the president to take action on these requests so that the people of southern illinois can finally know what they may expect
4552674 teenagers across illinois have really stepped up and gotten involved in
4552675 thanks to some tough new laws and the efforts of so many young people across the state we have seen a historic decline in fatal crashes involving teenagers now as we approach a new school year we want to build on our success and work to save even more young lives
4552676 illinois strengthened teen driver safety law which resulted from the recommendation of my teen driver safety task force has been in effect since january 1 2008 and is having an immediate impact
4552677 i am encouraged that teen crash fatalities have dropped from 82 over the first 6 months in 2007 to 39 over the same time period this year this statewide program will continue to draw even more attention to the issue of teen driving and to the new law by utilizing the creativity of teens to develop effective safe driving messages for their peers
4552678 we are greatly pleased to continue our commitment to this important initiative focused on teen safe driving
4552679 the 2008 operation teen safe driving campaign was a major success and this innovative program continues our ongoing commitment to safety
4552680 the allstate foundation is proud to be a part of a campaign that has helped to save the lives of so many teens here in illinois our goal is to ensure that we have an even greater impact this year
4552681 under the leadership of governor blagojevich illinois has made remarkable progress in increasing safety belt use and reducing traffic fatalities to the lowest level since 1924
4552682 but teen drivers account for more than their share of crashes in 2007 teen drivers made up approximately seven percent of the population but were involved in 16 5 percent of the fatal crashes operation teen safe driving tackles this problem head on
4552683 the illinois state police understands the challenges teenagers face as they begin driving
4552684 the operation teen safe driving initiative provides an avenue for young drivers to use their creativity and innovation in their schools and community to reduce the number of teen motor vehicle crashes and fatalities
4552685 idots division of traffic safety continues to pioneer groundbreaking ways to reduce dangerous behavior behind the wheel by teens
4552686 the ilcc is committed to equipping teens with the knowledge attitude and skills necessary to resist teen drinking the most effective teen drinking prevention programs encompass coordinated school family and community efforts the program is an outstanding way to bring those components together and t he ilcc is proud to be part of this innovative peer led program

4552807 to begin a discussion of the consequences of what russia has done this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics

4552819 students use their computers for much more than just writing papers and research
4552820 its a way to stay connected with family and friends watch movies listen to music play games and more all these applications many of which will be used simultaneously generate a lot of demand for computing power so they need a lot of ram a substantial hard drive and the fastest processor available and they need to be mobile the device needs to be light small enough to fit in the classroom and able to run on battery power for several hours
4552821 sophisticated elegant design is the number one priority among students
4552822 i speculated on self assembling nanotechnology paints that integrate solar cell technology into the paint and include a back layer that comprises a battery where it can store the electricity generated

4552833 if we cant even pronounce beijing correctly and consistently how can we ever hope to address deeper cross cultural misunderstandings and conflicts
4552834 television networks should be setting a higher standard of pronunciation and fulfilling their role of informing and educating the viewing public
4552835 mispronunciations are misinformation the casual attitude of the networks towards this matter is at best negligent and at worst bordering on disrespect for china and the chinese

4552837 when i was in my 30s 50 just seemed so ancient to me
4552838 i was in high school when she hit it big
4552839 now that her first young fans are in their 30s we look at madonna as sort of a harbinger of the future for us and the future looks pretty good
4552840 is that aging is not the inevitability that we might have assumed by watching our fathers now in their 50s and 60s madonna is proof that exercising and eating right at an early age pays off
4552841 i want to know who her doctor is its really hard to believe shes 50 she looks 40 and she just keeps going at it living life and loving life
4552842 put a picture of a 50 year old woman today next to one from my mothers generation
4552843 we look at least 10 to 15 years younger than they did
4552844 also 50 really is a new beginning for so many women
4552845 many have accomplished a number of their goals already their children are getting older for the first time they can really think about themselves and ask what do i want from life
4552846 as the cliche goes i guess its better than the alternative
4552847 i just dont feel like what 50 should feel like
4552848 i remember my grandmother at 50 her hair was completely white my mother too was just at a very different place in her life than i am now
4552849 shes done a remarkable job of marketing herself and shes always been able to reinvent herself
4552850 im sure shes happy to be an inspiration to women and men of any age

4552863 but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups you could actually save just as much
4552864 theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption
4552865 efficiency experts say that keeping tires inflated can improve gas mileage 3 percent and regular maintenance can add another 4 percent many drivers already follow their advice but if everyone did we could immediately reduce demand several percentage points in other words obama is right

4552875 for much of the modern scientific era following copernicus galileo and newton belief in general reverted to the idea of a universe infinite in both age and extent thereafter from the middle of the nineteenth century this view began to come under increasing pressure to the point that it has completely lost its domination for belief in a beginning is once again the majority view of contemporary scientists evidence from the red shift in the light from distant galaxies the cosmic microwave background and thermodynamics has led scientists to formulate the so called standard big bang model of the universe stephen hawking adopts a similar view many people do not like the idea that time has a beginning probably because it smacks of divine intervention one such was sir arthur eddington 1882 1944 who reacted as follows philosophically the notion of a beginning of the present order of nature is repugnant i should like to find a genuine loophole that repugnance was shared by others in the mid twentieth century for example gold bondi hoyle and narlikar advanced a series of steady state theories in which it was argued that the universe had always existed and that matter was continuously being created in order to keep the density of the admittedly expanding universe uniform the creation rate they needed was incredibly slow one atom per cubic metre in ten billion years this meant incidentally that there was no real possibility of testing the theory by observation it is rather ironical that in the sixteenth century some people resisted advances in science because they seemed to threaten belief in god whereas in the twentieth century scientific ideas of a beginning have been resisted because they threatened to increase the plausibility of belief in god

4552934 i think the bigger concern for them should be if you have government dictating content policy which by the way would have a big first amendment problem
4552935 then whoever is in charge of government is going to determine what is fair under a so called fairness doctrine which wont be called that itll be called something else
4552936 so will web sites will bloggers have to give equal time or equal space on their web site to opposing views rather than letting the marketplace of ideas determine that
4552937 the fairness doctrine has not been raised at the fcc but the importance of this election is in part has something to do with that
4552938 so you know this election if it goes one way we could see a re imposition of the fairness doctrine there is a discussion of it in congress i think it wont be called the fairness doctrine by folks who are promoting it i think it will be called something else and i think itll be intertwined into the net neutrality debate
4552939 portland transportation officials say that their own surveys show that actually 6 of the citys residents are pedaling to work tops in the nation for a large city
4552940 the funny thing about portland is that the area really doesnt have a tremendous number of miles of separated bike paths instead the city has put bike lanes and routes on streets with lower volumes of traffic and emphasized connections
4552941 i rented a bike on the northwest side of portland the citys bike map helped me easily navigate to the riverfront bike path to the hawthorne bridge which has bike lanes on both sides of it when a cyclist arrives at the east side of the willamette river the bike lane within several blocks peels off busy hawthorne and instead puts cyclists on parallel residential streets again there were plenty of signs and street markings and again there were a ton of cyclists on the street going both directions
4552942 the funny thing is that many cities here have designated bike routes you see those little green signs everywhere in pasadena for example i think the difference in portland is the emphasis on connectivity its also a geographical and cultural thing commutes are shorter and residents clearly are into cycling
4552943 cheryl kuck a spokesperson for the citys transportation bureau said that as more people have taken to biking the city is mandated to keep spending money to keep improving facilities

4552978 after you talked to us about how you approached random people because you felt like god was pushing you i felt like that was what god was trying to do with me i prayed about it and i was able to confront one of my former best friends i think i helped her because she seemed better but it might be for the time being she was going through alot and i felt like i should talk to her about it instead of cooing her and telling her stuff that would make her feel better we have a pretty strong bond i suggested she talk to god about it because i know that he listens even though it doesnt seem like it at first i felt alot better after i talked to her about it hopefully it helped her too i want god to give me more of these pushes now

4553029 ilocano bagnet is one of the key things i remember most from our trip to vigan ages ago its crispy though not as crunchy or light as your regular we were tempted to try one of their cakes for dessert but i remembered one of my favourite places in baguio i cannot say just how much i adore this place enough whenever we head up to baguio it is imperative that chocolate de batirol before our return to manila they also have a branch in serendra but theres nothing quite like drinking piping hot chocolate de batirol in cool baguio weather for those of you not yet familiar with what exactly it is im going to cheat a little and provide you an excerpt from my own blog from almost a year back best thing you can have when youre cold its a very thick sweet rich chocolate drink made from tablea which are chunks of blended cacao and ground peanuts which give it its trademark gritty texture and hints of nuttiness you can get them either sweetened or unsweetened at supermarkets and in the palengke wet market i particularly love the ones from the palengke since the texture from their tablea are thicker and grittier yum if youre visiting someone and your host requests their help to make you some chocolate eh it means that they like you if they request for chocolate ah to be prepared then it means quite the opposite as im sure you can deduce preparation it is thick rich and sweet while chocolate ah is much more watery that was back during the time of the spanish colonization i dont think anyone still has ah for that matter prepared for their guests anymore thats a pity you prepare it by taking a cup of evaporated milk or regular or low fat milk for those of you who dont wish to be that sinful p for every 1 2 tablea you use once youve mixed the paste tablea milk you pour it into a mixing bowl or a traditional whip it into a foam using the batidor by rubbing your hands together with the batidor between them thus rolling the batidor of course if you dont have a batidor you can use a whisk or a fork but you wont get it all nice and foamy thats okay tho will still taste v good bibingka to snack on but it was late in the afternoon already and they had a great many customers by then a good lot of whom apparently also had the same freshly cooked bibingka craving instead i ordered us a plate of suman sa lihia which came to us still steaming

4553101 newly obtained documents prove that in 2003 barack obama as chairman of an illinois state senate committee voted down a bill to protect live born survivors of abortion even after the panel had amended the bill to contain verbatim language copied from a federal bill passed by congress without objection in 2002 explicitly foreclosing any impact on abortion obamas legislative actions in 2003 denying effective protection even to babies born alive during abortions were contrary to the position taken on the same language by even the most liberal members of congress the bill obama killed was virtually identical to the federal bill that even naral ultimately did not oppose

4553105 in a bit of historical revisionism swift boat veterans for truth founder and unfit for command co author john oneill distorted jerome corsis role in co authoring the book
4553106 simply an editor and not really any sort of co author
4553107 unfit book materials show corsi more than just an editor
4553108 one of the authors of a new anti john kerry book frequently posted comments on a conservative web site describing muslims and catholics as pedophiles and pope john paul ii as senile in chat room entry last year on freerepublic com corsi writes islam is a peaceful religion just as long as the women are beaten the boys buggered and the infidels are killed in another entry he says so this is what the last days of the catholic church are going to look like buggering boys undermines the moral base and the lawyers rip the gold off the vatican altars we may get one more pope when this senile one dies but thats probably about it

4553110 the late great usa the coming merger with mexico and canada
4553111 any more worthy of being taken seriously than those who think jews rule the world or the truthers who think president bush is responsible for 9 11
4553112 yesterday jerome corsi was prattling on about the north american union again after michael medved deservedly spanked him for spreading conspiracy theories while i dont think corsi is any more worthy of being taken seriously than those who think jews rule the world or the truthers who think president bush is responsible for 9 11 i thought i would respond to him one last time i think thats about the fourth time ive said that now why respond again whats the point well unfortunately a lot of conservatives consider this conspiracy theory to be so preposterous that they believe its beneath them to even bother discussing it and that leaves corsi and his ilk to dominate the debate and since there are a lot of conservatives being taken in by this north american union nonsense somebody has got to step up to the plate
4553113 i guess there are people who believe in the plan for a north american union but there are people who believe in bigfoot
4553114 all his life jerome corsis been told that were running out of oil
4553115 i remember driving with my dad in a 1952 plymouth and listening to him talk about the end of oil
4553116 im at the point where the dinosaur theory seems silly
4553117 you take a pile of cats and you bury them dig them up 10 years later and you dont get oil
4553118 the truth is that there is so much oil around the world that its been easy to find

4553229 first the company paid 20 000 to become a member of the national gay and lesbian chamber of commerce and to have a seat on the board of directors next mcdonalds refused a request to remain neutral in the culture war by choosing to promote the gay agenda then mcdonalds accused those opposing the gay agenda including same sex marriage of being motivated by hate
4553230 now we learn that mcdonalds sponsors training for homosexuals on how to promote their agenda among corporations from the inside out amp equal workplace advocates is a national organization devoted to the lesbian gay bisexual and transgender lgbt community in the workplace one of its primary purposes is to train employees how to aggressively promote homosexuality within the company they work for all the way to the corporate boardroom
4553231 part of last years out amp equal summit in washington d c sponsored by mcdonalds was an organized march into congressional offices demanding same sex marriage laws be passed
4553232 after afa exposed it it was removed by the mcdonalds employee
4553233 mcdonalds says they stand by and support our people to live and work in a society free of discrimination and harassment
4553234 here is what they wont tell you mcdonalds helped sponsor the san francisco gay pride parade
4553235 it continues to amaze me that corporations like mcdonalds continue to publicly and financially support things that alienate their consumer base
4553236 shareholders as well as customers should be outraged at the blatant position this company has taken on this issue mcdonalds corporation has a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders to continue to earn profits and expand their company by alienating such a large consumer base the christian community they are undoubtedly neglecting this responsibility
4553237 we have gotten good responses from some other christians about spreading the boycott picketing of mcdonalds elsewhere
4553238 america is tired of corporations and organizations twisting the free speech and actions of its citizens into hatred when we simply oppose the corporations or organizations involvement in areas where we dont want our money going
4553239 we love your fries but we will not compromise truth you have taken money that our family and millions of others have contributed to the success of the mcdonalds corp and chosen to use it for an agenda that defies the foundation of our nation the family as created by a man and woman
4553240 i will take my 10 great grand children to wendys burger king or some other place you are not the only game in town
4553241 this is not about hate mcdonalds but about good people opposed to a lifestyle we believe is immoral
4553242 i have been a mcdonalds customer since your burgers cost 15 cents since you have decided to advocate and support the destruction of traditional marriage and by extension the family i will no longer patronize your stores
4553243 i dont buy any more from you neither will my friends here in my nation uruguay
4553244 marriage between a man and a woman is the norm throughout the world
4553245 its a shame that mcdonalds would tarnish their family friendly image but the company has ramped up its support of the gay agenda and it leaves us no option but to call for a boycott

4553250 since islam prohibits proselytism by other religions foreign religious workers will in effect be denied entry to conduct religious work
4553251 deporting christians for worshipping in their private homes shows that king abdullahs speech is mere rhetoric and his country is deceiving the international community about their desire for change and reconciliation
4553252 the mere fact that rabbis would be openly invited to the kingdom a country where in principle jews are not permitted to visit would have constituted a turning point
4553253 this gives us a better picture of what countries discriminate against us based on religion
4553254 while i am not claiming that this technology couldnt be made to work its just not going to be pretty i dont believe it will scale anywhere near effectively and the bandwidth requirements alone are going to cause some very tough questions to be asked about whether this will run at all
4553255 the whole aim of our work last month on the ruby demo for amd was to show that the quality of offline and real time work is identical starting with this generation of gpus the following presentations this month are just introducing lightstage and how it makes characters or any cg object look 100 real in those real time environments
4553256 the virtual worlds these technologies are going to be applied to was not meant to be discussed until later this year after one further announcement regarding the server side platform being developed for otoy we had nothing to do with editing or leaking this video and cant comment on anything other than the otoy technology since this project is still under nda

4553269 las indemnizaciones por antig edad en los casos de despidos las indemnizaciones por despidos por causa de maternidad o embarazo las indemnizaciones por despidos por causa de matrimonio la indemnizaci n especial prevista en el art culo 52 de la ley 23
4553270 el principio de la interpretaci n estricta que rige en derecho tributario ha llevado a algunos tribunales a interpretar la exenci n del art culo 20 inciso i como aplicable nicamente a la indemnizaci n por antig edad excluyendo as tanto a las indemnizaciones por maternidad y matrimonio como a la prevista en el art culo 52 de la ley de asociaciones gremiales
4553271 el tfn ha realizado una extensi n interpretativa de la ley que forz su esp ritu al encuadrar la indemnizaci n por despido por maternidad en el supuesto de la exenci n que se refiere expresamente a la indemnizaci n por antig edad
4553272 si el legislador hubiera querido incluir el caso en examen en esa exenci n lo hubiera previsto en forma expresa de modo que la resoluci n contradice el criterio con que deben interpretarse las normas y fundamentalmente el car cter restrictivo que prima en la consideraci n de las exenciones impositivas
4553273 la finalidad de la indemnizaci n por despido es siempre la misma pues con ellas se intenta entre otras cosas proveer al sustento del trabajador hasta tanto pueda obtener nuevos ingresos
4553274 ello se ve agravado en el caso de la mujer embarazada pues en raz n de su estado es altamente probable que demore m s tiempo que otro trabajador en conseguir un empleo rentable y adem s porque se presume que deber proveer no s lo a su sustento sino tambi n al de su hijo y que perder las asignaciones familiares previstas con motivo de su embarazo incluso la correspondiente al nacimiento

4553314 when ms karen hughes was appointed as undersecretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs she set the tone to continue a disastrous policy of outreach with islamist partners
4553315 publicly challenged the designation of hezbollah and hamas as terrorist organizations
4553316 is suspected of being a pivotal cog in the muslim brotherhoods high command in america
4553317 disturbing considering the radical divisive positions of many of its leaders and the unbalanced views espoused by fellows of the organization
4553318 legitimizes islamism to the world and sends mixed messages to our allies
4553319 sending a terrible message to moderate muslims who are thoroughly disenfranchised by the funding

4553321 a muslim brotherhood affiliated organization which was an unindicted co conspirator in last years terrorist financing trial against the holy land foundation
4553322 held private meetings with organization leaders and delegates including representatives of the muslim students association
4553323 the question is why should the state department spend u s taxpayer dollars to work with islamists who actively oppose the foreign policy goals of the united states and subscribe to a supremacist oppressive ideology
4553324 to make sure that the state department is not giving u s tax dollars to those on the other side in the war on terrorism
4553325 i know there are many in our community so desperate for peace that they want us to sweep under the rug the pro terrorism positions of some groups

4553354 as como el hijo del hombre no vino para que se le ministrara sino para ministrar y para dar su alma en rescate en cambio por muchos
4553355 por medio de l tenemos la liberaci n por rescate mediante la sangre de ese s el perd n de nuestras ofensas seg n las riquezas de su bondad inmerecida
4553356 adem s los bendijo dios y les dijo dios sean fruct feros y h ganse muchos y llenen la tierra y soj zguenla y tengan en sujeci n los peces del mar y las criaturas voladoras de los cielos y toda criatura viviente que se mueve sobre la tierra
4553357 y tambi n impuso yehowah dios este mandato al hombre de todo rbol del jard n puedes comer hasta quedar satisfecho
4553358 y dios procedi a crear al hombre a su imagen a la imagen de dios lo cre macho y hembra los cre
4553359 dios es un esp ritu y los que lo adoran tienen que adorarlo con esp ritu y con verdad
4553360 y a ad n dijo porque escuchaste la voz de tu esposa y te pusiste a comer del rbol respecto del cual te di este mandato no debes comer de l maldito est el suelo por tu causa
4553361 por medio de un solo hombre es decir ad n el pecado entr en el mundo y la muerte mediante el pecado y as la muerte se extendi a todos los hombres porque todos hab an pecado
4553362 porque sabemos que la ley es espiritual pero yo soy carnal vendido bajo el pecado
4553363 ni uno de ellos puede de manera alguna redimir siquiera a un hermano ni dar a dios un rescate por l y el precio de redenci n del alma de ellos es tan precioso que ha cesado hasta tiempo indefinido
4553364 y tu ojo no debe sentirse apenado alma ser por alma ojo por ojo diente por diente mano por mano pie por pie
4553365 que se dio a s mismo como rescate correspondiente por todos de esto ha de darse testimonio a sus propios tiempos particulares
4553366 por esto el amor de dios fue manifestado en nuestro caso porque dios envi a su hijo unig nito al mundo para que nosotros consigui ramos la vida mediante l 10 el amor consiste en esto no en que nosotros hayamos amado a dios sino en que l nos am a nosotros y envi a su hijo como sacrificio propiciatorio por nuestros pecados
4553367 no antes bien se despoj a s mismo y tom la forma de un esclavo y lleg a estar en la semejanza de los hombres
4553368 as tambi n est escrito el primer hombre ad n lleg a ser alma viviente el ltimo ad n lleg a ser un esp ritu dador de vida
4553369 porque as como mediante la desobediencia del solo hombre muchos fueron constituidos pecadores as mismo tambi n mediante la obediencia de la sola persona muchos ser n constituidos justos
4553370 pues dado que la muerte es mediante un hombre la resurrecci n de los muertos tambi n es mediante un hombre porque as como en ad n todos est n muriendo as tambi n en el cristo todos ser n vivificados
4553371 por lo tanto en aquel momento pilato tom a jes s y lo azot por lo tanto en aquel momento l se lo entreg a ellos para que fuera fijado en un madero entonces se encargaron de jes s y cargando el madero de tormento para s mismo l sali al llamado lugar del cr neo que en hebreo se llama g lgota y all lo fijaron en el madero y con l a otros dos hombres uno de este lado y uno de aquel pero a jes s en medio pues bien cuando hubo recibido el vino agrio jes s dijo se ha realizado e inclinando la cabeza entreg su esp ritu
4553372 s sabio hijo m o y regocija mi coraz n para que pueda responder al que me est desafiando con escarnio
4553373 por dicha voluntad hemos sido santificados mediante el ofrecimiento del cuerpo de jesucristo una vez para siempre
4553374 porque cristo entr no en un lugar santo hecho de manos el cual es copia de la realidad sino en el cielo mismo para comparecer ahora delante de la persona de dios a favor de nosotros
4553375 porque todos han pecado y no alcanzan a la gloria de dios y es como d diva gratuita que por su bondad inmerecida se les est declarando justos mediante la liberaci n por el rescate pagado por cristo jes s
4553376 l nos libr de la autoridad de la oscuridad y nos transfiri al reino del hijo de su amor 14 por medio de quien tenemos nuestra liberaci n por rescate el perd n de nuestros pecados
4553377 si hacemos la declaraci n no tenemos pecado a nosotros mismos nos estamos extraviando y la verdad no est en nosotros si confesamos nuestros pecados l es fiel y justo para perdonarnos nuestros pecados y limpiarnos de toda injusticia
4553378 porque si la sangre de machos cabr os y de toros y las cenizas de novilla rociadas sobre los que se han contaminado santifica al grado de limpieza de la carne 14 cu nto m s la sangre del cristo que por un esp ritu eterno se ofreci a s mismo sin tacha a dios limpiar nuestra conciencia de obras muertas para que rindamos servicio sagrado a l dios vivo
4553379 visto por lo tanto que tenemos un gran sumo sacerdote que ha pasado por los cielos jes s el hijo de dios tengamos asida nuestra confesi n de l porque no tenemos como sumo sacerdote a uno que no pueda condolerse de nuestras debilidades sino a uno que ha sido probado en todo sentido igual que nosotros pero sin pecado
4553380 pero el don que dios da es vida eterna por cristo jes s nuestro se or
4553381 con eso o una voz fuerte desde el trono decir mira
4553382 tanto am dios al mundo que dio a su hijo unig nito
4553383 nadie tiene mayor amor que este que alguien entregue su alma a favor de sus amigos
4553384 esto significa vida eterna el que est n adquiriendo conocimiento de ti el nico dios verdadero y de aquel a quien t enviaste jesucristo
4553385 pues esto es lo que el amor de dios significa que observemos sus mandamientos y sin embargo sus mandamientos no son gravosos
4553386 el que ejerce fe en el hijo tiene vida eterna
4553387 en verdad como el cuerpo sin esp ritu est muerto as tambi n la fe sin obras est muerta
4553388 porque yo les he puesto el modelo que as como yo hice con ustedes ustedes tambi n deben hacerlo
4553389 por esto cuando se juntan en un mismo lugar no es posible comer la cena del se or
4553390 mientras continuaron comiendo jes s tom un pan y despu s de decir una bendici n lo parti y d ndolo a los disc pulos dijo tomen coman
4553391 y con ruego a favor de ustedes ellos sienten anhelo por ustedes a causa de la sobrepujante bondad inmerecida de dios sobre ustedes a dios vayan las gracias por su indescriptible d diva gratuita

4553408 allowing ample opportunity for discussions before the partners leave niue at 9 40pm
4553409 there is therefore no basis to any suggestion that new zealand is somehow preventing the participation of the fiji interim government delegation in either the forum or the post forum dialogue

4553416 45 then goeth he and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last state of that man is worse than the first even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation
4553417 22 let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water
4553418 8 and god which knoweth the hearts bare them witness giving them the holy ghost even as he did unto us 9 and put no difference between us and them purifying their hearts by faith
4553419 17 that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love
4553420 15 and let the peace of god rule in your hearts to the which also ye are called in one body and be ye thankful 16 let the word of christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with grace in your hearts to the lord
4553421 10 for this is the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days saith the lord i will put my laws into their mind and write them in their hearts and i will be to them a god and they shall be to me a people
4553422 11 and such were some of you but ye are washed but ye are sanctified but ye are justified in the name of the lord jesus and by the spirit of our god
4553423 1 but there were false prophets also among the people even as there shall be false teachers among you who privily shall bring in damnable heresies even denying the lord that bought them and bring upon themselves swift destruction
4553424 20 for if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the lord and saviour jesus christ they are again entangled therein and overcome the latter end is worse with them than the beginning
4553425 the latter end is worse for them than the for if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the lord and saviour jesus christ they are again entangled therein and overcome the latter end is worse with them than the beginning 21 for it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than after they have known it to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them 22 but it is happened unto them according to the true proverb the dog is turned to his own vomit again and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire
4553426 14 having eyes full of adultery and that cannot cease from sin beguiling unstable souls an heart they have exercised with covetous practices cursed children
4553427 1 but there were false prophets also among the people even as there shall be false teachers among you who privily shall bring in damnable heresies even denying the lord that bought them and bring upon themselves swift destruction
4553428 12 take heed brethren lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living god 13 but exhort one another daily while it is called to day lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin
4553429 26 for if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins 27 but a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation which shall devour the adversaries 28 he that despised moses law died without mercy under two or three witnesses 29 of how much sorer punishment suppose ye shall he be thought worthy who hath trodden under foot the son of god and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing and hath done despite unto the spirit of grace
4553430 the last state of that man is worse than the first
4553431 15 but sanctify the lord god in your hearts and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear
4553432 1 if ye then be risen with christ seek those things which are above where christ sitteth on the right hand of god 2 set your affection on things above not on things on the earth
4553433 16 let the word of christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with grace in your hearts to the lord
4553434 3 i will set no wicked thing before mine eyes i hate the work of them that turn aside it shall not cleave to me 4 a froward heart shall depart from me i will not know a wicked person
4553435 8 finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things
4553436 wherefore laying aside all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envies and all evil speakings 2 as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that ye may grow thereby
4553437 16 let the word of christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with grace in your hearts to the lord
4553438 14 be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion hath light with darkness
4553439 1 having therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit perfecting holiness in the fear of god

4553515 minutes before the official announcement of pope benedicts election cardinal macharski points to the liberal reporters assembled in st
4553516 bring it i still help elect the popes around here last time i checked
4553517 macharski emboldened by the felicitous election of ratzinger jumps the gun and announces gaudium magnum annuntio urbi orbi et universo
4553518 it took some effort to get that check i had my mom send me my checkbook and i walked to the post office in camp liberty in baghdad with an envelope addressed to barack obama in chicago illinois
4553519 he was right on iraq long when others were jumping into the sea like lemmings and thats hard to do were soldiers and we respect courage
4553520 we would never do anything to hurt one of the movies or the series we love our fans
4553521 if i cant see it now then i will just never watch it
4553522 his words inspired me to vote and ive been voting ever since
4553523 im not a particularly thrifty person but theyve got me watching pennies right now
4553524 we are in idaho lets start walking and someone will pick us up in a few minutes
4553525 are both committed to winning back the white house and to ensuring that the voices of all 35 million people who participated in this historic primary election are respected and heard in denver
4553526 to honor and celebrate these voices and votes both sen obamas and sen clintons names will be placed in nomination
4553527 this wasnt something she was itching for looking for but so many of her supporters said it was important to them and the obama people got how important it was to smooth over any tensions and that it was the right thing to do
4553528 i am convinced that honoring sen clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4553529 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect sen obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4553530 following a brief conversation between dj vlad and ross in which ross said we got beef ross accomplices who had surrounded dj vlad while he spoke with ross proceeded to strike and beat dj vlad in ross presence and without any protest on ross part
4553531 we made sure we gave ourselves as many chances down their end they had three chances down in our end and they executed for three tries
4553532 we fought pretty hard and they put 30 on us we know where we are
4553533 i just think the minor premiership whoever wins it halfway through the next week its forgotten i dont know what you should get but its a good achievement and this is a tough competition i just think its a tribute to a teams consistency
4553534 hopefully it will be us but like i say were just worried about the week in week out and well worry about the end of competition then
4553535 von der d sseldorfer wahl erhoffen sich viele im land einen fingerzeig
4553536 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4553537 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4553538 the bath bomb softened my skin and relaxed my sore muscles the pumice stone smoothed out my flip flop ravaged heels
4553539 the fizzy bubbles were delightful the fragrant soup quite relaxing it was as if i was bathing in an ice cream soda i did feel the need to rinse off in the shower though which kind of defeats the skin nourishment and enrichment benefits as for the sandwich pumice is pumice but my feet did feel softer
4553540 the ice cream scoop made my skin feel like velvet and it wasnt overly perfumey while the sandwich made my feet silky and smooth
4553541 hopefully it will only be not even a week ive got to wait until i get the scans
4553542 he got a headknock there too but its his ankle thats the problem im not quite sure how bad it is they think it could be a couple of weeks if not worse
4553543 to be completely honest im not really sure what happened
4553544 i know i had a head clash with dallas because i had a ton of claret around the head
4553545 i got dizzy and fell back and my ankle got caught underneath me i just remember trying to get up and not being able to push off my foot im feeling very positive hopefully the scans come up positive as well

4553554 hey pal i hear you on the safety issue my point is that the way to meaningfully improve safety conditions especially on the bridges is to address the abysmally poor crossing designs
4553555 re electric bikes and speed limits most e bikes out there require that the cyclist be pedaling before the motor will add boost and the bikes are speed limited thats not to
4553556 zeldab i fear my first assumption may have been wrong reflectors alone do not meet the night time running requirements for riding a bike at night in new york or most
4553557 i want to get a little fresh air and exercise and cut my carbon footprint and spend less money on gas and where i live i can ride my bike seven months out of the year
4553558 if youve got a date you go to meet friends you go out on a conventional bike youre gonna sweat up you go out in an electric bike its great its terrific youre not gonna sweat up and you ride home fine
4553559 fifty percent of that increase is probably because of gas prices and the rest is that theres just more bikes out there
4553560 when i started there was only one bike that had a nickel metal hydride battery everything else was lead acid and was 80 or 90 pounds
4553561 the new designs that weve seen in the marketplace are going to inure to the benefit of the electric bike companies
4553562 a year ago when you mentioned the word electric bike people looked at you and they really werent sure what it was
4553563 today what were finding is were actually having dealers call us seeking an electric bike to meet the demand
4553564 did you know there are 70 million electric bikes on the road today in china and they are selling at the rate of 2 6 million electric bikes a year
4553565 the public at large needs to understand that it is the right thing to do to move to electric transportation and electric bikes and electric scooters will allow you to do that to get that familiarity
4553566 the entire nation is watching to see how we handle this
4553567 this is a question of character as well as one of finance
4553568 im just really disgusted with the incompetency of these officials
4553569 i am firmly convinced that bankruptcy or default would irreparably harm this county
4553570 musharraf is going to fight these charges on a moral ground to try to disprove them but when it comes to the numbers i think hes lost it
4553571 they dont know what they are getting into they have pushed him into a corner maybe before he might have thought about stepping down but not now
4553572 i think he feels that his replacement at this stage would compromise pakistan
4553573 negotiations are going on between the coalition and the army for a safe exit to be given to musharraf
4553574 i think the americans and the army are demanding he be given safe passage for the army impeachment would mean a huge distraction from the war on terror and may even be seen as the army being impeached
4553575 weve said he can have what he wants his house his security
4553576 the time has come for the military leadership to go and have a quiet word with mr musharraf

4553600 the rhino incident has had a devastating impact on my life
4553601 my right leg was crushed by the rhinos roll bar the pain has been unbearable for over a year i was confined to bed while having to undergo seven surgeries i will never again be able to hike ski or participate in other outdoor activities that i enjoyed
4553602 the design flaws make the rhino dangerously susceptible to tipping and rolling even when being driven at slow speeds
4553603 i hope that my lawsuit sends yamaha a clear message that it must recall the rhino and fix its stability flaws before more riders are severely injured or worse killed
4553604 while its retrofit program was a step in the right direction yamaha has neither acknowledged nor addressed the rhinos core stability problems
4553605 the tip overs and terrible accidents will continue to occur so long as the stability problems are not fixed

4553620 wrote many of the songs in the early days and he drew upon his knowledge of jazz and the blues because songs always have to have a source this is not to say that there is not great originality

4553629 even though its pop culture thrown straight in there it definitely shows a relaxed approach by the north korean government
4553630 we were living in real time on the web and then we get to north korea and were in the dark
4553631 through this we really open doors and have these unique opportunities and that kind of scares politicians
4553632 it would just suck to wind up in a situation you dont want to be in a place like that
4553633 the last place i would want to be is in a north korean police station trying to explain myself

4553649 with some of this sharp price collapse in commodities you would think the market would be up a lot more
4553650 the underlying factor is that credit continues to appear to be very weak
4553651 at the beginning of this year earnings expectations started to drop precipitously and the stock market dropped with them
4553652 those expectations got built into the stock market and to an excess a lot of stocks discounted all of the bad news that was out there
4553653 its a fabulous market for trader types that play off all this volatility but long term investors are still scared

4553660 the immediate and orderly withdrawal of russian armed forces and the return of those forces to russia
4553661 the minister general st bonaventure said to us here are some anecdotes that brother illuminato who accompanied st francis on his visit to the sultan of egypt told us
4553662 your lord taught in his gospels that evil must not be repaid with evil that you should not refuse your cloak to anyone who wants to take your tunic etc mt 5 40 in that case christians should not invade our land
4553663 that you have not read the gospel of our lord jesus christ completely in another place we read if your eye causes you sin tear it out and throw it away mt 5 29 here he wanted to teach us that every man however dear and close he is to us and even if he is precious to us as the apple of our eye must be repulsed pulled out expelled if he seeks to turn us aside from the faith and love of our god that is why it is just that christians invade the land you inhabit for you blaspheme the name of christ and alienate everyone you can from his worship but if you were to recognize confess and adore the creator and redeemer christians would love you as themselves
4553664 the dollar is on fire again so thats causing people to re evaluate everything
4553665 it means oil prices could fall dramatically we could see prices get to double digits if this continues
4553666 theyre basically saying we could have an oil glut because demand is slowing

4553668 with this signature by georgia this must take place and take place now
4553669 you are dealing with a people who despise anything human
4553670 we need to do our utmost to deter such behavior in the future
4553671 to begin a discussion of the consequences of what russia has done this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics
4553672 its clearly a very emotional time but i think that it should still be seen that this was a productive day i hope now that peace can return to georgia and georgians can return to a normal life
4553673 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4553674 the united states would never ask georgia to sign onto something where its interests were not protected
4553675 when tsunami hit thailand we received all kind of help from all over the world and this is our turn
4553676 were small but we will do our best and what ever the out come will be the contributions will do on behalf of thai community in the city of angles
4553677 as to the t mobile rumor i really cant comment but android has been due for sometime now
4553678 q4 delivery of an android product would make sense and htc does seem to be the most likely device manufacturer to deliver a first android device
4553679 htc is good at developing uis user interfaces and touchscreen interfaces and also at working with a complex operating system like windows mobile i have pretty strong faith in htcs ability to work with linux and android and roll out a device that t mobile htc google and the open handset alliance will be happy with
4553680 there have been complaints on the developer side around the sdk software developer kit it is also facing competition from other oses operating systems namely the limo foundations flavor of mobile linux the no 1 seller of smartphones has also announced its intent to offer the os royalty free and we cant forget about blackberry the iphone and windows mobile devices
4553681 android is late to the party and will have a tough time gaining significant market share in this crowded marketplace but at the end of the day google wants more openness in wireless networks with greater access to the internet from mobile devices this is happening
4553682 with android you dont have one device that you can use as a frame of reference
4553683 a large number of developers dont know what it an android phone is going to look like or how popular its going to be i dont see or hear a large number of developers that are developing for android yet
4553684 its something that weve wanted to do and we want it to be legal and we are very very excited
4553685 how do i feel about it i obviously feel like its long overdue i think someday people will look back on this like women not having the right to vote and segregation and anything else that seems ridiculous that we dont all have the same rights
4553686 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4553687 working closely with our partners in europe and other members of the g7 to bring a resolution to this crisis
4553688 there will be a time and place to deal with
4553689 regional countries are capable to do it we all need to protect the iraqi state
4553690 i have never said iran would move in to iraq when america left the country i have just said america is aggressive and it is cruel and it will have to exit from iraq soon
4553691 this issue was underlined during our talks yesterday natural gas and oil agreements take time because they need investment

4553696 in this hour of crisis divisive politics will lead us nowhere
4553697 it is my conviction that all issues can be resolved only through dialogue and peaceful means
4553698 i make a sincere appeal to the people of the state to maintain peace and calm in this difficult hour
4553699 hey theres some guy out here trying to steal your stuff
4553700 i am irritated and angry that our government is really willing to open up diplomatic relations while gadhafi is still in power since he is responsible for the murders of american citizens
4553701 i would gladly forego the money to have libya remain on the state sponsored terrorism list so long as gadhafis in power
4553702 i dont think we should be doing this in exchange for libya getting a free ride
4553703 are running out of places to go and basic necessities
4553704 the tamil tigers are keeping them in harms way and the government is not doing enough to ensure they receive essential assistance
4553705 these measures seem designed in part to use civilians as a buffer against government forces a serious violation of international humanitarian law the tamil tigers have also engaged in forced recruitment
4553706 when i look at aidens friends and i see some of them married and have a family i would imagine that would have been the way aiden was
4553707 life would have been very different for all of us
4553708 it sort of brought it all back to the surface at the same time i had got on with my life i suppose i had to you see having older children but especially for the younger children

4553710 the world is gonna get every bit of dade county i got in me if you dont understand what that means watch the hurricanes of the 90s
4553711 we have had employees assaulted before by people in the last several years
4553712 i think that safety is big concern we are seeing a lot of anger in society
4553713 when you make schools gun free zones its like inviting people to come in and take advantage
4553714 if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them
4553715 we want them to pay attention to their school work

4553722 the more liberal camp just assumes that pastor warren is going to make this a christian litmus test of the presidency others who are more conservative fear he is going to wimp out on some of the issues
4553723 he says neither group understands or knows me hes going to ask tough questions fair questions not gotcha questions
4553724 its a great way for him to do what he can to make connections with not only moderate evangelicals but also the many people out there who read the purpose driven life
4553725 you just wonder is he trying to shoot himself in the foot
4553726 obama is going to make real inroads for people who want to be satisfied that this is a pretty religious guy but that hes not a lunatic
4553727 i think rick is in an unenviable position in that he stands to get attacked from the right and the left based on what direction he takes
4553728 as an evangelical i am much more interested in his list of questions than in either of their answers
4553729 i do not have any trust in this legal farce
4553730 i think he thinks this circus has gone on long enough
4553731 the fact that an act is undertaken to prevent a threatened terrorist attack rather than for the purpose of humiliation or abuse would be relevant to a reasonable observer in measuring the outrageousness of the act
4553732 the cumulative effect in my interpretation is to put american troops at risk
4553733 five or six nasty squabbles is not that much over 19 years
4553734 i could never never pay you back for these 19 years
4553735 the deployment of new anti missile forces in europe has as its aim the russian federation
4553736 the moment has been chosen well and therefore any fairy tales about deterring other states fairy tales that with the help of this system we will deter some sort of rogue states no longer work
4553737 it is sad for europe and for everyone living on this densely populated continent but it is not dramatic
4553738 we will continue to work on this and we are ready to continue discussions with all participants but it is clear this decision will not create any sort of calm
4553739 a shameless attempt to push the homosexual agenda on the american people by exploiting american soldiers who are currently in harms way around the world
4553740 todays olympic moment is about two young gymnasts who are the best the world has to offer and not just when theyre performing either
4553741 were both incredibly strong athletes and gymnasts and she won worlds last year and shes a phenomenal athlete and i couldnt speak any more highly of her heart its been amazing and its been a great journey and its been a really cool ending
4553742 but im going to have to really study obama i personally think he lacks a lot of experience
4553743 its pretty hard to see how its anything other than a straightforward set of copyright violations

4553757 modern agriculture will have to change radically if the world is to avoid social breakdown and environmental collapse
4553758 to argue as we do that continuing to focus on production alone will undermine our agricultural capital and leave us with an increasingly degraded and divided planet is to reiterate an old message if those with power are now willing to hear it then we may hope for more equitable policies that do take the interests of the poor into account
4553759 the right to a fair and public trial is a bedrock principle of democracy
4553760 unfortunately in this regard members of the armed services have fewer rights than those granted to criminal defendants in civilian courts
4553761 we believe that at a minimum the armed services should create an easily accessible docket of information listing those charged details regarding the charges against them and the date and time of their trials and pre trials

4553807 first i thought well theyre going to make some announcement or there is going to be movement of some kind people are going to evacuate
4553808 i really wanted to get deeper inside how our brain operates in disasters
4553809 one of the biggest surprises for me is that the behavior is the same in very different kinds of disasters big and small whether youre on an airplane or in a honda civic or in a house fire
4553810 the thing that we most expect to happen is very rare
4553811 most people seem to go through three phases in almost every kind of disaster
4553812 we can end up wasting a lot of time and moving extraordinarily slowly
4553813 where we get really social and talk to each other

4553829 fda is the government agency we rely upon to assess food contact products theyve assessed this issue in great detail and their conclusion is very reassuring
4553830 its ironic fda would choose to ignore dozens of studies funded by the national institutes of health this countrys best scientists and instead rely on flawed studies from industry

4553843 its quite possible h9n2 is infecting humans quite a lot much more than we appreciate merely because it is beyond the radar
4553844 in humans it is very mild so most of the time its probably not even recognised or biologically tested
4553845 its quite a silent virus its not highly pathogenic and sometimes it causes some morbidity in poultry but by and large it is just there and its unnoticed
4553846 there are other viruses out there besides h5n1 that could be the next pandemic
4553847 but i suspect h9n2 will not be so severe in its outcome

4554088 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4554089 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4554090 critics lament how much corn goes into ethanol but often ignore the coproducts and calculate too high a figure

4554097 a great bond with the community something were trying to achieve
4554098 and that wouldnt be right for the people that work there if they want to unionize obviously theres something not going well with management but as far as professional ethics go these people have rights and they should be voiced
4554099 the earths solid inner core started to form over a billion years ago when the liquid iron core that surrounds it became cool enough to begin solidifying it has now grown to a radius of around 1200 km but the difficulty in studying it is the thousands of kilometers of rock in the way as a result we know more about the surfaces of other planets than we do about the deep interior of our own however we have a powerful tool for studying the inner architecture of the earth
4554100 a side benefit of this network is that the data can also be used to study the deep earth looking for extremely faint vibrations passing through the very center of the planet one such subtle signal is the seismic wave called pkjkp the properties of this wave contain a wealth of information about the earths inner core

4554108 paul designed that the habit of doing good with their money should be constant
4554109 in a bit of historical revisionism swift boat veterans for truth founder and unfit for command co author john oneill distorted jerome corsis role in co authoring the book
4554110 simply an editor and not really any sort of co author
4554111 unfit book materials show corsi more than just an editor
4554112 one of the authors of a new anti john kerry book frequently posted comments on a conservative web site describing muslims and catholics as pedophiles and pope john paul ii as senile in chat room entry last year on freerepublic com corsi writes islam is a peaceful religion just as long as the women are beaten the boys buggered and the infidels are killed in another entry he says so this is what the last days of the catholic church are going to look like buggering boys undermines the moral base and the lawyers rip the gold off the vatican altars we may get one more pope when this senile one dies but thats probably about it
4554113 the real reason behind president bushs push for immigration reform says author jerome r
4554114 the late great usa the coming merger with mexico and canada
4554115 any more worthy of being taken seriously than those who think jews rule the world or the truthers who think president bush is responsible for 9 11
4554116 yesterday jerome corsi was prattling on about the north american union again after michael medved deservedly spanked him for spreading conspiracy theories while i dont think corsi is any more worthy of being taken seriously than those who think jews rule the world or the truthers who think president bush is responsible for 9 11 i thought i would respond to him one last time i think thats about the fourth time ive said that now why respond again whats the point well unfortunately a lot of conservatives consider this conspiracy theory to be so preposterous that they believe its beneath them to even bother discussing it and that leaves corsi and his ilk to dominate the debate and since there are a lot of conservatives being taken in by this north american union nonsense somebody has got to step up to the plate
4554117 i guess there are people who believe in the plan for a north american union but there are people who believe in bigfoot
4554118 all his life jerome corsis been told that were running out of oil
4554119 i remember driving with my dad in a 1952 plymouth and listening to him talk about the end of oil
4554120 im at the point where the dinosaur theory seems silly
4554121 you take a pile of cats and you bury them dig them up 10 years later and you dont get oil
4554122 the truth is that there is so much oil around the world that its been easy to find
4554123 were awash in oil theres more oil today in proven reserves than ever before in human history
4554124 after their bitter campaign 2004 experience with the swift boat veterans for truth john kerry and his fellow dems arent waiting to be shot at again yesterday aides to sens kerry hillary clinton joe biden and ted kennedy jumped all over literary mugger jerome corsi co author of the kerry bashing best seller unfit for command they knocked him to the ground and kicked him in the face metaphorically anyway over his next democrattrashing tome atomic iran how the terrorist regime bought the bomb and american politicians the book which nashvilles cumberland house publishing wont release till next month claims democratic pols are being corrupted by iranian money and helping the nuke seeking mullahs in tehran
4554125 lets see exactly why it isnt the case that islam is a worthless dangerous satanic religion wheres the proof to the contrary
4554126 islam is like a virus it affects the mind maybe even better as an analogy it is a cancer that destroys the body it infects
4554127 first lets undermine the us in vietnam then we can go for gay marriage when you get to be pres jfk lite there will be no end to how much of america we can destroy

4554139 forget it the only thing these islamonazis understand is force time to nuke the temple of the dome and send this
4554140 go for the oil fields set the mad dog lawyers loose lets roll take even the diapers from their heads remember according to the koran islam approves of lying as long as it is to non believers saudis are lying killers who harbor killers
4554141 islam is like a virus it infects the minds of the believers
4554142 good plan raise obl from the dead every time we get ready to ice another islamonazi on to baghdad lets roll
4554143 nuke the islam nazis and lets move on no more muslamo fascists
4554144 islam has declared world war iii against everything non muslim
4554145 when will the liberal media wake up to see that islam has declared a world war against everyting non muslim may allah be damned to the hell muslims wish to create on earth
4554146 may islam join the garbage heap of worthless religions we have grown beyond any believers of hermes out there
4554147 all arab muslims lie the koran endorses lying to infidels namely us none of these names are real abdallah is really mohammad mohammad mohammad readily altered to include atta or haj or whatever else they decide to call themselves for the moment
4554148 gotta love this stupid religion islam makes the nazis look like a sunday stroll in the park islam its gotta be straight from hell just the devil in disguise that seems to about sum it up
4554149 arabs lie islam preaches lying to infidels fingerprints dont lie boo hoo time to demand ids to check into hotels and passport registration for all foreign nationalists who want hotel rooms also id checks and passport registrations for anyone renting an apartment

4554154 lets see who is it not politically correct to profile
4554155 finally a way to end jihad maybe the whole arab world will blow itself up live by the sword die by the sword seems an ancient formula bye bye jihad
4554156 i repeat muslims cancer cells its hard to tell the difference no doctor worries about the first amendment rights of cancer cells the therapy is to eliminate cancer cells so the body can go on living great to repeat it keeps the thread going let the muslims stop preaching terror and ill revise my view meanwhile muslims cancer cells is an equation that works
4554157 may all these arab maniacs explode and kill themselves next time maybe they will take arab rat with them best solution to the homicide bombers is that they eliminate themselves with as little loss to civilians as possible
4554158 i repeat muslims cancer cells its hard to tell the difference no doctor worries about the first amendment rights of cancer cells the therapy is to eliminate cancer cells so the body can go on living
4554159 muslims cancer cells its hard to tell the difference no doctor worries about the first amendment rights of cancer cells the therapy is to eliminate cancer cells so the body can go on living
4554160 we find there is even uncertainty whether stanley ann and obama senior were ever married in a church
4554161 on feb 2 1961 several months after they met obamas parents got married in maui according to divorce records
4554162 other sources say divorce papers confirm that a civil ceremony was held on maui on february 2 1961 when ann was three months pregnant with obama
4554163 senator obama could claim to be a citizen of kenya as well as of the united states obama can trace his heritage back to his mother who was born in the united states and was an american citizen when he was born and to his father who was born in kenya and was a kenyan citizen when obama was born

4554168 its a privilege to have the leadership of such a reputable club
4554169 our greatest ongoing success as a club is keeping it going after all these years
4554170 the best thing about the team was the friendly camaraderie after the games both within our own team and with the opposition
4554171 after games we used to retire to the bel air street armoury for a few drinks
4554172 my best single experience so far was my first full game it was hard work but very rewarding at the end
4554173 after the first practice you have 20 new friends we make players feel welcome and we get them drunk
4554174 i have won gold in the world championships many times but i was expecting something really special at the olympics and i got it im delighted
4554175 i havent decided whether i will run the 5000m yet
4554176 its pretty hard to see how its anything other than a straightforward set of copyright violations
4554177 there are entire magazines with no commentary no criticism clearly not a case of classic fair use
4554178 the first sale doctrine says that once i buy a physical copy of something i can do whatever i want with it except copy it
4554179 we take our intellectual property seriously and are considering appropriate action on this matter
4554180 simple solution is to return the device to the store provider from which it was purchased and demand repair or replacement
4554181 i will be out of the office until next monday if this is an emergency please call my colleague
4554182 immediately and unconditionally cease military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory the consequences of euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4554183 us should immediately work with the e u and put diplomatic pressure on russia to reverse this perilous course that it has chosen
4554184 we should immediately call a meeting of the north atlantic council to assess georgias security and review measures nato can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation
4554185 a convicted sexual felon should not be able to live next door to your college student
4554186 theyre living away from home for the first time theyre staying out late i know theyre drinking we need to ensure their safety
4554187 its a real problem to find them a place to live
4554188 people end up living under bridges or in cars we would prefer they have a roof over their heads
4554189 for people to say this isnt a priority because its based on the possibility of harm is just wrong
4554190 for the most part these people have done their time
4554191 were better off educating students and preparing them to take accountability for their own public security
4554192 i think its just a knee jerk reaction to a problem that doesnt exist its going to make things 10 times worse
4554193 i have once again become a medium of violence in the world
4554194 inflicted by an evil demon that is nurtured by our so called criminal justice system
4554195 i dont know what god wants for me i just dont know
4554196 in heaven there may be some evidence down in the lolo forest because thats where we were
4554197 the entire nation is watching to see how we handle this
4554198 this is a question of character as well as one of finance
4554199 im just really disgusted with the incompetency of these officials
4554200 i am firmly convinced that bankruptcy or default would irreparably harm this county
4554201 la gente empez a gritar y a correr por todos lados pidiendo ayuda hab a dos pelados tirados vueltos nada y unos ni os heridos

4554206 a company will incorporate offshore where there are no taxes
4554207 that parent company charges the u s company lots of money for things like the trademark for the company logo the u s company says i made 50 million but my stupid parent company charged me 50 million for the logo the u s company gets to deduct the royalty fees as an expense and move profits to the parent company offshore in a tax free haven
4554208 weve talked to a potential partner at company x and they said they were interested and would be a beta site
4554209 weve held some 3rd party focus groups of our target audience and the feedback was
4554210 our top three nearest competitors are x y and z although all of them are trying to be destination sites and the teams behind them dont have a history in the target market we on the other hand are multimodal being a website mobile application and social web application and weve been living and breathing this space for the past 3 years
4554211 our plan calls for 3mm which gets us from beta product through a 1 0 launch and an early partner business model over the coming 12 months
4554212 vi har f rdiggjort de sidste dr ftelser og har fremlagt anklageskriftet for justitsministeren dern st vil det blive pr senteret for lederne af regeringskoalitionen enten s ndag eller mandag for slutteligt at blive fremlagt for underhuset

4554221 si empezamos mal con pleitos en el tema energ tico podemos tener un mal periodo
4554222 d monos cuenta todos queremos sacar a pemex pero en el fondo el pan quiere abrir a privados eso est muy claro el pri no quiere meterse con las corrupciones del sindicato por una raz n evidente nosotros no estamos de acuerdo con ninguna de esas dos cosas queremos que se eliminen la corrupci n tanto en el sindicato como en las filiales y que hacienda deje de comerse a pemex como se lo ha venido comiendo
4554223 hemos tenido discusiones muy fuertes pero con un cierto objetivo fundamental
4554224 tranquilos no somos v ndalos lo que pasa es que stos se quieren robar el pa s entonces qu tame a mouri o juan camilo mouri o de encima y entonces empezamos a hablar porque el se or sigue haciendo contratos despu s de ser nombrado secretario de gobernaci n tiene como tesorero de todas sus empresas contratos con pemex
4554225 nos parece que son gente que conoce y nosotros vamos a defender la constituci n sin ninguna duda
4554226 sea un periodo como el del septiembre diciembre del a o pasado donde la c mara resolvi much simos problemas no sin dificultades pero resolvimos muchas cosas
4554227 si se van a tomar decisiones concretas estoy absolutamente de acuerdo las fotos ya no nos interesan lo importante es que se tomen decisiones concretas
4554228 when in the fresh mornings i go into my garden before anyone is awake i go for the time being into perfect happiness
4554229 if you have a garden and a library you have everything you need
4554230 he who owns a garden however small it be whose hands have planted in it flower or bush or tree he who watches patiently the growth from nurtured sod who thrills at newly opened bloom is very close to god
4554231 like a big mountain a small garden stimulates restores and delights us just as it poses challenges promotes mastery provides exercise and relieves monotony
4554232 though an old man i am but a young gardener
4554233 a garden is never so good as it will be next year
4554234 gardening is the art that uses flowers and plants as paint and the soil and sky as canvas
4554235 hey i think that boys got talent we need him on our side
4554236 back in the reagan years the national endowment for democracy was created as a cold war tool today the ned is a neocon controlled agent for us world hegemony its main function is to pour us money and election rigging into former constituent parts of the soviet union in order to ring russia with american puppet states
4554237 the neoconservative bush regime used the ned to intervene in ukrainian and georgian internal affairs in keeping with the neoconservative plan to establish us friendly and russia hostile political regimes in these two former constituent parts of russia and the soviet union
4554238 during the late 1970s there was new thinking at the highest levels of the u s foreign policymakers and they reconsidered whether these ugly murderous military dictatorships of the 1970s were really the best way to preserve u s interests in these countries
4554239 this new thinking led to the establishment in 1983 of the national endowment for democracy they had chosen the german pattern in which the major political parties in germany have foundations financed by the federal government they did more or less the same thing with the establishment of the ned as a private foundation there is really nothing private about it and all its money comes from the congress
4554240 a lot of what we ned do today was done covertly 25 years ago by the cia
4554241 a propaganda scam that is attempting to present an aggression on the part of the georgian army against its own citizens as a conflict between georgia and russia
4554242 a century of war anglo american oil politics and the new world order
4554243 what washington is literally playing with here is nuclear war by miscalculation thinking they can outflank the russians psychologically and militarily
4554244 there are more than 1 000 us military special forces in georgia doing exercising training georgian troops before georgia launched the attack on ossetia on 8 august there are 1 000 israeli troops at least private security firms and military advisors including advisors who are upgrading the georgian air force in an installation near tbilisi thats what the russian airplanes hit and they essentially made the military strike on south ossetia militarily impossible by making incursions inside georgian territory before they announced that they were calling a halt to their military operations
4554245 young adult women who undergo induced abortion may be at increased risk for subsequent depression
4554246 a large contingent of georgia army national guard soldiers flew to the republic of georgia on sunday for joint military exercises at a time when tension is brewing in the region
4554247 theres no accountability how do you manage or supervise in an environment where theres no accountability
4554248 gina works well with her fellow employees gina is a very good employee
4554249 you may not know why you cried now but youll learn
4554250 honesty joy openness to listening to ones neighbor the capacity to forgive generosity goodness and cordiality
4554251 are indicative of the fact that faith is truly present
4554252 the picture is completely absolutely 100 on schedule on time there were no delays ive seen the movie it is fabulous we would have been perfectly able to have it out in november
4554253 the royal film performance has been around for a long time and has a tradition of showcasing the best films we are confident we will be able to do that again this year
4554254 i dont think theres a great overlap in the audiences for bond and potter
4554255 theyre different films aimed at different markets so i dont see them as competitors or rivals
4554256 you want to put your biggest releases on as many screens as possible
4554257 if there is a scenario where theyre being hogged by a film that is lingering around why not wait
4554258 im not kidding myself that everything is perfect but i said after the doncaster game on saturday that we had to get a result from somewhere and when we did we would go on a bit of a roll obviously a result from anywhere for us is great given the situation weve been in its the first time weve come into training after weve won a match ok we beat sheffield wednesday but on penalties i was asking for a touch of reality after the doncaster defeat and theres no difference now its only one result but its the one result everyone has been talking about and about how we hadnt won a game weve won now and ok its a cup match but weve got to take that positive feeling into the league
4554259 once we scored you could see the spring in the step of our players
4554260 the fitness levels were excellent and we could have run out even more confident winners
4554261 i thought sav did ok but i also thought the three subs had an impact on the game so it is a dilemma for me
4554262 they are all in the frame for saturday its something for me to sleep on and im not quite sure of my team yet
4554263 its always a worry when you lose in a play off final but they have bounced back with a good win against blackpool and another win against peterborough
4554264 its an atmospheric ground ashton gate its on tv and we can go there knowing we can win a game of football
4554265 we are keeping our fingers crossed but there are concerns about him
4554266 well know more about the long term on monday and whether hes going to be fit quickly or be out for a while
4554267 competition in there is not as strong as i would like
4554268 weve got good competition up front at the back and in the wide areas but we are light on competition in midfield we are looking at one or two and there might be something next week
4554269 perlas patra as disparates y trapacer as en los medios de comunicaci n
4554270 perlas patra as disparates y trapacer as en los medios de comunicaci n
4554271 ya que hay una gran cantidad de personas mayores que habitan en esta zona que se ven obligadas a trasladarse sin medios propios al centro de salud de los gladiolos o al de la avenida de venezuela los m s cercanos
4554272 ya que en estos momentos se ven obligados a utilizar como tal el local de la asociaci n de vecinos un lugar poco adecuado para velar a sus difuntos
4554273 la necesidad de que se potencien las actividades deportivas y los juegos aut ctonos para que los j venes ocupen su tiempo de manera sana y positiva
4554274 i have been using post header images on almost every posts on this blog
4554275 perlas patra as disparates y trapacer as en los medios de comunicaci n
4554276 people who already have existing cardiovascular disease may want to talk to their physician before they drink red bull in future
4554277 how can you expect to learn unless you first empty your cup
4554278 aquele que oculta suas transgress es n o ter sucesso mas aquele que as admite e abandona receber miseric rdia
4554279 se ele tardar espere por ele pois certamente vir sem demora
4554280 why not show us the human side of jesus life on earth
4554281 its becoming almost like an arms race as to who can ban more things
4554282 san francisco bans plastic bags then la bans plastics then everyone else has to its ironic because the us was founded as a reaction to the colonists telling them what to do i mean hey when are we gonna start banning alcohol again
4554283 we are taking a strong step toward creating a healthier future for california
4554284 the government here in california is banning a food product simply because its not healthy
4554285 what do you ban next bacon fat the possibilities are limitless
4554286 an activist government that thinks it knows whats best for us
4554287 theyre banning fast food restaurants in parts of la because they think were too fat and therefore theyre gonna help us
4554288 trans fat raises bad cholesterol and lowers good cholesterol so yeah its a double whammy
4554289 but in two years time its gonna be a thing of the past not because of the government but because consumers are voting with their feet you dont need to criminalise it the government has created a dangerous precedent

4554405 para nadie es desconocido que bucaramanga se ha vuelto una especie de estaci n para estos individuos los narcos y eso incentiva el crimen pero tambi n en la ciudad hay desplazados y reinsertados y eso tambi n podr a estar generando homicidios casi a diario

4554421 so are my other two brothers i have a rabbinical degree though i do not practice when i lived in montreal my smicha rabbinical certification was gathering dust on the bookshelf while a poster of elisha cuthbert hung from my wall i would explain to visitors that if my rabbinical degree had thighs like ms cuthbert it too would be hanging from the wall

4554428 well i dont know a lot about john mccains family history i do know however that as recently as last week i think it was the senator made a comment in south dakota regarding his wife entering some buffalo chips contest which is this topless deal and if she were to enter she would probably win it and my personal opinion and based on my understanding of the christian faith thats not not n o t not the type of expression that a presidential candidate or anyone for that matter who is a follower of the christian faith ought to make
4554429 i dont know if that is a perfect case in point but it surely does help to juxtapose the dna of senator obama if you would versus the dna of senator mccain
4554430 and as recently as yesterday i think it is our pastor from saddleback rick warren indicated that he would not feel comfortable voting for an adulterer and i dont know exactly to whom he was referring but i think the data speaks for itself and again at the end of the day and i really appreciate you raising this because at the end of the day again i think the american public deserves full revelation of the candidates character and competency character and competency so whatever questions that should be asked that would give the voting public an indication as to who they are and what theyve done should be fair game

4554463 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf

4554500 i was something of a daydreamer and a dawdler so they would only let me be the friendly voice that greeted you when you entered the restaurant

4554514 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4554516 one of the most important urban spaces since the renaissance
4554517 people enjoy it whether its running water or still water its something that you can just sit and reflect on it has a cooling effect maybe psychologically or something plus youve got all concrete and asphalt over that and having something that you can stick your feet in or get the mist off of its a nice break from all the hard surfaces
4554518 theres a fear that the whole commodity boom is going to end that the bubble is going to burst
4554519 the u s was the first economy to hit trouble
4554520 now people are realizing that the problems arent limited to the u s in some places they might even be worse
4554521 the usds upward momentum is developing freight train like qualities shredding those who attempt to fade the move but rewarding those on board
4554522 primarily the notion that the rest of the world is finally following the u s down the tubes
4554523 we have seen the lows of this multiyear cycle but i dont see the dollar going on a long bull run at this point
4554524 the cornerstone of technical analysis is that history repeats itself
4554525 in that case this could be the start of the bull run that leads us up to a strong point at the end of the decade
4554526 my advice to the obama people proceed with extreme caution they dont want to get into a discussion of character and background they are opening a door that they will not be able to close they are putting on the table issues and personalities that they do not want to discuss
4554527 i really love the self sufficiency of it that i know where the produce started and what the process is
4554528 especially in the winter when i go down in the basement to get the jars its a nice feeling
4554529 so many things are unknown with the way food is produced that it feels really good to keep control of it
4554530 it fits with what weve seen historically from the 1970s and even before then when people tighten their belts they focus a little bit less on convenience items and convenience foods and focus a little bit more on staying home and making their own whether youre talking about food or fun
4554531 the straw that broke the camels back was the economy
4554532 but the underlying reason is healthier food were tired of food that has tons of sodium preservatives and all the nasty stuff they put in food that you dont have to be eating
4554533 what i hear is the words the economy and weve started growing a garden because we dont know whats going to happen to the economy in the future
4554534 if i had 1 000 acres i dont think i would have been able to accommodate all the phone calls i had

4554623 can books be better than television you bet they can when lee goldberg is writing them get aboard now for a thrill ride
4554624 top billing should go to michael connellys harry bosch story suicide run and to lee goldbergs jack webbs star the former for the detection and the latter for biggest laughs
4554625 as dark and twisted as anything hammett or chandler ever dreamed up leaving travis mcgee in the dust
4554626 its funny with some great monkisms and tightly plotted the characters are expanded beyond their tv confines and theres even a clever twist at the end how tv tie ins should be
4554627 goldberg makes adrian monk much more interesting than the tv version
4554628 goldbergs succinct writing style with an emphasis on witty dialogue laugh out loud hijinks and nonstop action will make a devoted monk fan of anyone who picks up this surprisingly entertaining read

4554643 while consumers may want a smaller more fuel efficient vehicle they dont want to compromise on the feature and option content
4554644 nearly all consumers want the same or greater number of features and options in their next vehicle
4554645 that consumers are looking for better fuel efficiency today is not surprising
4554646 that they are unlikely to give up the features they currently have and may want even more features and options has strong implications for automotive manufacturers and dealers

4554662 the prime requisites to becoming a clamper are a sense of humor an interest in western history an open mind and a cast iron stomach if a man has those qualities and strikes up a friendship with a clamper or two he may find himself taken in to and by the ancient and honorable order
4554663 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
4554664 many of britains towns and cities have failed and been failed by policy makers for too long it is better to tell uncomfortable truths than to continue to claim that if we carry on as we are then things will turn out well just as we cant buck the market so we cant buck economic geography either places that enjoyed the conditions for creating wealth in the coal powered 19th century often do not do so today
4554665 was applied to someone with no sense of humor or someone who looked down on others usually in reference to the expression on their faces it seems that this might be where she coined the term

4554675 as a consultant in china for 4 years mind set culture in business is your toughest climb to smooth and efficient enterprise there is some emergence in the new social middle class who have been foreign educated and well aware of international cultural regimes networking is the way to succeed in global enterprises and this is very true in china it is who you know and your expertise is secondary
4554676 whats more important is how the dual role of executive party leader impacts on business decisions with western firms many chinese ceos party officials are in the executive party position of privileged elite job perks such car amp driver vacation houses etc become the expected norm this view of privilege perks carries over into negotiations and contract terms with western firms politics outrank business a project with government approval or direction will swamp out business issues and profits
4554677 they chinese ceos are dealing with more stakeholders than just shareholders they carry out much more responsibilities than maximizing shareholder value i think chinese government and communist party did a wonderful job in designing their organization which can pass along their policies optimized at nation wide level
4554678 interesting article i had never really thought that ceos in china had to deal carefully with the political system as well as dealing with the company but that would explain why chinese ceos behave more like little chairman maos at times than business strategists trying to maximize the benefits of team work and trying to improve the efficiency of the company this article tells me that they are in fact being concerned with navigating a political system
4554679 when foreign executives found themselves baffled in doing business in china they might not shoot themselves an excuse of politics or government they should spend more time to understand and master the situation it may be very different between doing business in china and other countries but that is what we call diversity

4554722 my right leg was crushed by the rhinos roll bar the pain has been unbearable for over a year i was confined to bed while having to undergo seven surgeries i will never again be able to hike ski or participate in other outdoor activities that i enjoyed

4554725 while its retrofit program was a step in the right direction yamaha has neither acknowledged nor addressed the rhinos core stability problems
4554726 the tip overs and terrible accidents will continue to occur so long as the stability problems are not fixed

4554831 we needed our online system to extend the complexities built into our core business systems out to the web without making the process too complicated for our customers the websphere commerce solution did this without having to completely rewrite our back end systems

4554833 using ibm software and soa companies like vantage can make it easier and less expensive for consumers to book vacations while reducing the time and money it takes to manage a complex business and web site like this

4554867 failure to replicate findings can be explained in a number of ways either the phenomenon does not exist and the initial positive finding was a random event or perhaps there were differences in the samples used one study may have tested higher functioning or older individuals while another used those with lower iq many studies have small sample sizes and as a consequence have insufficient statistical power to reveal between group differences procedural differences may also yield different outcomes
4554868 the speculations in the last paragraph bring us back to the question of what it must be like to be autistic see frith and happe 1999 ultimately the psychology of asd must provide an answer to this question but it must also provide an explanation readers who have made it this far as well as those who have skipped straight to here may be expecting such descriptions and explanations as well as a punchy take home message without wishing to be unkind to colleagues in the field or perhaps wishing to be unkind to those who often misinterpret their ideas the message is probably that we are sometimes too quick to generate quick snappy messages and that we are often too uncritical of the work we ourselves do autism spectrum disorder is now known to be a set of conditions that should not be reduced to a simple dichotomy of presence and absenc when present the conditions are multidimensional and complex and although they share the common characteristics of social impairment and repetitive behaviours at least from the perspective of a typically developed person they often exhibit additional features that are not necessarily defining features of the spectrum such complexity requires a more subtle explanation than a simple reduction to an absent theory of mind a failure of affective appreciation diminished sense of self of fragmented perception the complexity of asd requires us to take a more distanced view and to go beyond simply trying to find new ways of describing the fact that people with asd are autistic science is about the reduction of complexity to simpler sets of entitities and processes that interact in ways that are controlled descriptions of the behavioural manifestations of asd the challeng that faces us now is to step outside our own narrow conception of the issue and to work out how they fit together and why

4554985 in de winter van 1937 werd in vlissingen een ouder echtpaar vermoord de uitbaters van het caf keersluis ondanks een uitgebreide speuractie van de politie werd het misdrijf nooit opgelost de schrijver heeft een minutieus onderzoek uitgevoerd naar alles wat met de zaak te maken had afkomst achtergronden geruchten doodlopende sporen buren en relaties alles wat maar enigszins in verband met het echtpaar kon worden gebracht daarbij krijgt de lezer een goed beeld van de vlissinger samenleving in de jaren dertig van de 20e eeuw de schrijver had niet de pretentie de moord te kunnen oplossen het was hem onder andere te doen om duidelijk te maken wat voor impact zon moord heeft op een toch vrij gesloten gemeenschap jaren later werd er nog over gepraat de schrijver is zeker geslaagd op boeiende en prettige wijze wordt verslag gedaan van het onderzoek waarbij men zich erover kan verbazen dat er nog zo veel bewaard is gebleven vele functionele fotos verluchtigen het geheel dat vooral voor mensen uit de stad en uit de streek interessant is

4554995 you can only connect them looking backwards so you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart even when it leads you off the well worn path and that will make all the difference
4554996 youve got to find what you love and that is as true for work as it is for your lovers your work is going to fill a large part of your life and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work and the only way to do great work is to love what you do if you havent found it yet keep looking and dont settle as with all matters of the heart youll know when you find it
4554997 death is very likely the single best invention of life your time is limited so dont waste it living someone elses life dont let the noise of others opinions drowned out your own inner voice and most important have the courage to follow your heart and intuition they somehow already know what you truly want to become everything else is secondary

4555002 my personal opinion and based on my opinion of the christian faith thats not the type of expression a presidential candidate or anyone following the christian faith ought to make
4555003 helps to juxtapose the dna of sen obama with dna of sen mccain
4555004 at the end of the day again i think the american public deserves full revelation of the candidates character and competences
4555005 many in the christian community have not forgotten sen mccain leaving his first wife for his second wife one month after a disfiguring car accident
4555006 those facts are still there they are in the background
4555007 thats not what their mccain campaign wants to bring up before this forum
4555008 these smears on john mccains character and faith expose the utter hypocrisy of barack obamas claim to represent a new kind of politics its disgraceful
4555009 know that john mccains faith and character were tested and forged in ways few can fathom

4555014 a prenup requiring long term care insurance makes sense for any couple concerned about protecting their assets careers or ways of life
4555015 the bride should be especially concerned since women live longer than men and tend to inherit the care giving chores
4555016 i love the guy but im not signing up to be his nurse or purse
4555017 like millions of other women over 40 sarah knows first hand what caring entails
4555018 she spent countless hours caring for her now deceased stepmother and father and for a friend who died of cancer and now wants a life of her own
4555019 with her husband to be covered by long term care insurance sarahs assets will be protected
4555020 her time and lifestyle will also be protected also she has children and grandchildren whose inheritance will be protected should the need for care materialize she can spend quality time with her husband letting others perform the nursing chores and she can relax knowing that her own financial future will be secure
4555021 by getting married instead of staying single he can get a discount on his long term care policy
4555022 and of course he can also enjoy the benefits sarah enjoys with her policy protection of his own assets and peace of mind knowing he will not burden his children with future care expenses or chores
4555023 he wont have to worry about becoming her nurse or wallet should she require care before he does

4555100 o objetivo dos estados unidos era empurrar a r ssia a uma resposta militar o escandaloso n o a atua o da r ssia mas a dos estados unidos
4555101 ao declarar que o c ucaso uma regi o localizada a milhares de quil metros do continente americano pertence a sua esfera de interesse os estados unidos cometeram um grave erro

4555105 os dirigentes georgianos s fizeram isso porque tiveram o sentimento de serem apoiados e incentivados por uma for a bem maior

4555115 while pets are mere property in the eyes of the law the difference between a cat and a stereo is self evident
4555116 before this law a lot of well meaning peoples hands were tied when they found pets in empty homes of course the most important thing is for folks not to abandon their pets in the first place but at least now these unlucky animals will have a chance to get the life saving care they need

4555134 in texas i think the connection is to the song and thats what im about
4555135 texas music is about the songwriting the story as opposed to the picking i took that attitude to nashville where i was around a bunch of hot pickers and that was good for me too i was playing beside a bunch of great sidemen while i strummed along with my three chords and sang
4555136 texas had some circles of musicians and if you were in them it was great but if you werent you were real hungry for music
4555137 here its more americana more song friendly and more attuned to the americana style than the nashville new country kind of thing
4555138 im lucky to be in east tennessee and im real blessed to be in this very impressive circle of friends
4555139 i came from texas to nashville just to get around music
4555140 west texas at the time was kind of dry musically its not always that way but it was at the time so i went to nashville and tried to break into studio work
4555141 you just learn as you go and songwriting works the same way as anything else
4555142 i started listening to bluegrass and americana a lot and got a batch of songs for my horse is drunk ive learned how to craft a song better since then i just feel like my songwritings gotten more compact i can say what i want to say with less words and dead air
4555143 when you hear them you cant tell whether theyre happy or sad because theyre funny and tragic at the same time
4555144 my favorite writers do that their songs have enough humor to where theyre almost pathetic because theyre so funny and if you listen to one of those songs you dont know if theyre serious or not
4555145 you dont know if its some goof telling a story or the most important thing youve heard and you dont figure out if its happy or sad until youve heard it five or six times thats what i go for is it an optimistic or pessimistic kind of song
4555146 every day you wake up and go through these things and youve got to laugh at yourself but you also say man its hard to get through this
4555147 its about the challenges of life but youve also got to see how funny it is to be a human being if you can laugh your way through hard times thats good song material
4555148 for this kind of truth what good will come of it

4555157 if anyone is below 50 a gallon id be stunned
4555158 we have a pretty good idea on how to grow algae the biggest challenge is in the harvesting and how to extract it from the water
4555159 you arent going to find a fuel thats pennies on the dollar than what we find today
4555160 even if we were to double the volume we were to make in biofuels every year for the next 10 years were still looking at maybe this will impact 15 percent of the overall fuel supply

4555171 wenn sich die nato auf ihrem gipfel in bukarest nicht auf dr ngen von frankreich und deutschland von uns abgewandt h tte w ren die russen jetzt nicht einmarschiert

4555179 russlands einfluss auf die ffentliche meinung in europa ist gewaltig der kreml arbeitet mit den alten instrumenten aus sowjetzeiten und kgb methoden
4555180 wenn das alte europa nicht einschreitet wird es selbst verlieren denn ohne georgien wird es noch abh ngiger von russischem l und gas und der kreml wird es gnadenlos in die zange nehmen und seine bedingungen diktieren
4555181 europa ist als n chstes dran in nicht allzu ferner zukunft wird der kreml es behandeln wie uns

4555200 but as you look further out this correction in commodity prices is decreasing inflation risks which takes the interest rate risks away for investors and gives the economies and the financial system more time to heal and ultimately a stronger rebound in the economy when it comes rather than short circuiting it with inflation fears and rate hikes that risk coming out is significant

4555220 people can get hurt when they get into a hot car

4555225 id say most drivers are not aware of it if its hot they might crack the window a little bit or leave their sun roof open a little bit but i think thats where it ends

4555227 they can actually lower the temperature in your car by 50 degrees and that can make all the difference
4555228 if you dont like going into your car when its all hot and stuffy and you dont like touching your steering wheel when its already 110 degrees or waiting for the ac to finish cooling your car before you can drive it window tinting is an excellent choice
4555229 with window tinting you get an add on because your ac is not working as hard when your car isnt as hot and you can save maybe one or two miles per gallon
4555230 some people dont want to do a list because they dont want to make a menu
4555231 the time you take to plan your meals before heading to the store will pay for itself in results at the end of the week first make a list of healthy meals that fit your diet and are highly appealing

4555251 on the contrary we should intensify our contacts and our meetings to stop the suffering of our people

4555264 the casinos ameristar in particular its a very clever attempt by them to hide behind the children of this state
4555265 its very deceptive because at first glance it looks like its going to help elementary and secondary education in the state
4555266 its a mystery as to why they tried to pick so many issues and put them into one ballot issue

4555292 barack obama has voted in support of higher taxes 94 times in just 3 years including higher taxes for americans making just 42 000 a year if voters consider barack obamas record of opposing tax cuts and his outspoken proposals to raise taxes on family savings social security and small businesses this latest campaign promise lacks a single shred of credibility
4555293 this ad is just more of the same old false and discredited attacks that senator mccain knows arent true senator mccain will say or do anything to hide the truth while obama will cut taxes for the middle class mccain will give a billion dollars in new tax breaks to americas eight largest corporations while his plan provides no direct relief for more than 100 million american families and despite his rhetoric hes refusing to support the bipartisan senate proposal to expand production and invest in renewable energy because he wants to protect tax breaks for oil companies weve seen what happens when we put the oil companies and their lobbyists ahead of working families and thats exactly what americans want to change in this election

4555313 highlights starkly the extreme risks faced by all those promoting the right to education in conflict areas and the urgent need for the international community and all those involved in this and similar conflicts to put a stop to such attacks
4555314 do not simply fail to value education they deliberately target it
4555315 their attacks on schools teachers and others working on education are systematic not random they are part of a deliberate attack on human rights on equality for women and on any attempt by their fellow citizens to control their own destiny

4555445 cameras are fixed at an intersection and there is a timing sensor
4555446 one second after the red light turns red the camera takes a photo if a car runs a yellow light no photo is taken the photos capture the car and the license plate the officers come into the office and download the video reviewing it to determine which incidents are citations they then issue citations based upon what they see
4555447 the number of accidents has decreased with photo enforced traffic monitoring
4555448 a falling accident rate also gives us an overall time savings in the department since two officers have to investigate every incident that is not automated
4555449 we started looking at red light technology in late 2005 and began to set it up in january of 2006
4555450 signs with traffic fine notices were posted on all four corners of each intersection using the technology so that motorists would be warned in advance of automated monitoring we also publicized the plan in the newspaper and over the radio tv news after 25 days of warning the general public we began to issue citations from the system
4555451 we simply show them the photos of their vehicles with the time stamped times and dates
4555452 they dont have any idea about all of the images we can capture and quickly drop their challenges when they see the evidence
4555453 there is a review process back at the office of photographic evidence captured by the system
4555454 at that time we make sure the necessary information is added for citations in some cases we do not see an infraction in a given photo so there is also a review and approval process for photos taken at all of our 17 intersections now using red light technology
4555455 we also anticipate that biometrics capability will be added to field units for identification in the next five to seven years
4555456 the people who dont run red lights are all for the automated systems
4555457 those who get caught are not too happy although some people who have been issued citations have written us letters afterwards and thanked us for slowing them down

4555475 cancer cells thrive by disabling the molecular machinery that tells sick cells to die
4555476 by removing the ring we wanted to see whether we would trick the machinery to turn back on and thats what happened cells die more readily making it much more difficult for cancer to be established
4555477 we need to use genetics to sort out which individual iaps contribute to tumors and which iaps we need to target in order to cure cancer
4555478 this was a very big step in understanding what role iaps play in cancer but it isnt the last

4555492 these product enhancements are more evidence of the additional customer benefits we are creating through our collaboration with edelweiss air
4555493 edelweiss air is already well established in the swiss market and will now also be offering our swiss customers its top class product in the leisure travel field
4555494 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services as a result this business agreement will create positive outcomes for our customers shareholders employees and the communities we serve
4555495 this strategic relationship strengthens competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies we are applying for eu u s antitrust immunity in a changed regulatory world where london heathrow is open to any u s or eu airline that wants to fly to the united states and where rival alliances have immunity
4555496 customers will benefit the most from this relationship as they will have better connections to more destinations around the world it will increase competition as the three global airline alliances will play under the same rules we are taking a very important step towards consolidation which is necessary in todays aviation industry

4555500 these additional next generation 737s will enhance americans fleet with newer more efficient airplanes lowering fuel costs and lessening the environmental impact of flying
4555501 the flights could not operate if these strikes go ahead it would effectively shut down the airlines operations
4555502 the airlines and swissport will attempt to draft in management and where possible use non unionised workers there will be a risk of delays and this is worst time of year for it to happen at the peak of the summer season when flights are their fullest
4555503 our members are already struggling to keep up with rising food and energy costs this pay offer is an insult to professional hard working men and women who have to operate in extremely difficult conditions our members have had enough
4555504 this strike is totally unjustified union chiefs should be grateful that they are getting any increase at all at a challenging time for the global economy

4555522 it just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect meldrum said the dna test likely wont prove anything and at best might yield a gene sequence that doesnt match any other known primates whitton an officer on medical leave from the clayton county police department and dyer a former corrections officer announced the discovery in early july the picture they sent out in a news release and on their web site shows what appears to be a hairy corpse crammed into a chest freezer the accompanying announcement describes the creature as a 7 foot 7 male weighing 550 pounds with 16 inch human like feet and reddish hair messages left for whitton and dyer early today on their bigfoot tipline were not returned they have so far offered three different tales so far about how they came to find the creature in one the animal was shot by a former felon and the men followed it into the woods in a second version they found a family of bigfoot
4555523 its clear kilpatrick knew who detective white was he had previous contact with him through his other case
4555524 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started
4555525 why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4555526 it is a very big game i think it is a massive game
4555527 and i think it is a game when youre at home and youre a football player and you see the game on the tv and think i wish i could be involved in a game like that
4555528 there is a rich history to the civil war especially in terms of covert military tactics
4555529 american warfare in the 1860s was brutal yet surprisingly sophisticated so it was essential for us to capture this duality
4555530 primary goal is digital equity improving learning opportunities for all students
4555531 develop technology rich science curriculum modules for grades 3 6 which acknowledges that students learn in different ways
4555532 i know i shouldnt care but if i get called fag one more time im sick of it do you know what its like
4555533 i heard that he was even sneaking out to shelly allens house in the middle of the night dude i better kiss a girl before school starts you too were falling behind
4555534 kinda hard to sleep with all this you dont wanna go inside do ya
4555535 well um i cant believe we uh woke up last night
4555536 i mean in the storm we were cold and you know
4555537 we were playing some drinking game called thumper and now im tipsy
4555538 it was hard at first but i came out five years ago i was raised catholic so my family had a hard time with it but theyre getting better im really glad i did it it was like freeing a part of myself
4555539 i need to tell you something and i think you know what it is
4555540 dont say it i dont want to hear it son its late son and im tired
4555541 i dont what i wouldve done youre totally my hero
4555542 eli you know you want him come on pull the trigger its his year first round be a man
4555543 these oh thats just what i brought theres a lot more at home
4555544 is it the third round already damn i forget all about picks when the chick can do that with her tongue show magazine i mean seriously you think thats real shes got to be some kind of gymnast or something oh and give me willis mcgahee
4555545 oh that bothers you i guess you should read the rules on how long weve got to pick or are you too fast on the draw in everything
4555546 hey you got a second i wanted to talk to you about something
4555547 hey i really want to draft hines ward with my pick hes my dads favorite player and dads well hes not well you know could you do me a big favor and not take him please
4555548 drew brees nice pick he was a big key in last years championship especially after we drafted him in the 6th round
4555549 its not a revenue issue because weve already sold the ticket but the biggest thing to me is an atmosphere issue for the athletes and the other people in the venue
4555550 we have a responsibility to put some work into facilitating that process
4555551 weve got a few sort of steps in our planning but the first is to minimize the size of the sections for olympic family to really as small as it needs to be for those different groups to be able to do their jobs
4555552 those sections need to be big enough for them to do their jobs but no bigger
4555553 everybodys objectives are to have full venues its more fun for everybody and the atmosphere is better for everyone
4555554 so i think its just a matter of being proactive leading up to the games and just communicating with people well and having a place where they know who to contact and we have the ability to make changes quickly
4555555 hopefully we can set some trends make sure early we can intercept people who arent showing up find out if theres a reason and hopefully find a solution
4555556 the prime minister described russias incursion into georgia as a completely unjustified violation of georgias territorial integrity russian forces must withdraw immediately
4555557 the waxing itself is not an issue the bigger issue is whether they are encouraged to engage in risky behaviors

4555560 i can say nothing about mechanisms to banish the warships from sevastopol we just made public our official position
4555561 we condemn the powers that be for irreparably damaging ukraines national interests by unequivocally taking one side in the georgian ossetian russian conflict
4555562 for tasks incompatible with the status of its deployment in ukraine
4555563 to move on the ocean of life one has to open his sails at the appropriate time and take advantage of the wind
4555564 corruption in the government spreads into the ngo sector too ministries representatives allocate foreign grants to their relatives with fictional ngos
4555565 political attempts to change the demographics of kirkuk in favor of one ethnic group kurds have been continuing
4555566 if the kurds control the oil fields it would lead to a civil war in iraq
4555567 given the fact that some states the united states and groups the kurdish leadership in northern iraq do not take effective measures against the pkk terror before finding a solution for the kirkuk problem we should develop strategies to force them
4555568 i was a junior officer when the events of 1963 1964 and 1967 were taking place in cyprus i was a captain at the operation center in ankara during the turkish militarys cyprus operation in 1974 we consider the cyprus problem a national problem our goal is to maintain the development of the turkish republic of northern cyprus trnc its sovereignty and its peoples prosperity
4555569 without maintaining the structure of nation state it is not possible to maintain the unity of the state www
4555570 a prime member of congress responsible for 4 a gallon gas
4555571 i cannot say how many of us were there or the exact number killed but i will say this three days ago the bodies of six of our guys who died in the conflict zone were taken back to chechnya in our group only half survived a commander was also killed many were wounded if reinforcements hadnt arrived in time the georgians would have destroyed all of us
4555572 it would be wrong to make them out to be complete cowards and dilettantes they know how to and can fight the georgians have their heroes and their cowards just like in any army it would be wrong to lump them all together
4555573 we had only two possibilities either go to the war or be discharged
4555574 not to mention the fact that everyone knows what it means to remain today in chechnya where 80 percent of the population is unemployed so thats why we are fighting
4555575 by the way rumors that he has been removed from his job are putting it mildly contrary to fact true they have said that some sort of high position in the north caucasus military district is being prepared for him but so far anyway hes still our commander
4555576 the georgians put up fierce resistance with massive support from grad missile systems that hit a column of russian infantry and paratroopers
4555577 the russian armed forces incurred losses but then with close air support from helicopters assumed the offensive and after cleaning out the area went back behind the administrative borders of south ossetia
4555578 they are killing people there the chechens and the ossetians
4555579 when a person serving a sentence in a prison on the order of a court suddenly ends up being commander of an armed group not to mention a group of servicemen of the defense ministry of the russian federation this at minimum raises questions
4555580 i think that this happened with the connivance of the leadership of the 42nd motor rifle division to which the vostok battalion is subordinated
4555581 some mass media and journalists have at times wrongly interpreted my statements concerning the vostok battalion groundlessly asserting that i supposedly spoke out in favor of its disbandment i dont understand why demands to obey the law arouse such loose talk and attempts to stir things up by various media in fact i noted that all the members of a military unit should not suffer because of certain individuals the backbone of the servicemen is conscientiously fulfilling its military obligations but a criminal should be in prison i dont know a more precise way to say it the public also knows about crimes committed by the former commander of the vostok battalion sulim yamadaev who not only covered for a criminal i e badruddi yamadaev but has himself participated in the kidnapping and murder of citizens of the chechen republic the investigative committee recently launched a criminal case against him and put him on the federal wanted list we have received appeals from citizens of the republic who claim that their relatives were kidnapped by the yamadaev brothers we are simply obligated to get to the bottom of this the criminal actions of the yamadaev brothers and a number of persons operating together with them were a black mark on the entire russian defense ministry and discredited the local authorities it is completely natural that doubts arose among citizens of the republic who suspect that the authorities are simply covering up the crimes of battalion servicemen i have already said that i as guarantor of the constitution cannot allow a criminal whatever his regalia and position to stroll around in freedom i will again repeat that i am not calling for the disbandment of the vostok and zapad battalions although there are questions concerning the latter as well there are complaints from citizens about unlawful actions by zapad battalion servicemen
4555582 first of all i generally believe that war should be the last argument in resolving such conflicts
4555583 chechens have in full measure experienced and seen what armed conflicts bring ruin hunger death and destruction secondly the chechen republic is a subject of the russian federation and we do not have the right to make such political decisions in this connection i note the country russia has a political leadership and if it makes a decision we are to carry it out undeviatingly and in any form whether it is in the role of peacekeepers or the role of negotiators or in any other form i want to call attention to the fact that in that region despite difficult conditions russian peacekeepers the only guarantors of peace are effectively and responsibly fulfilling their duties
4555584 georgia carried out an attack on south ossetia on the first day of the olympic games on a day on which it has been on the contrary customary to halt any wars that in and of itself says a lot this is aggression the situation in the region is genuinely dangerous and has already reached unprecedentedly dramatic bounds and arouses extreme concern now the main thing is to take immediate action to defuse the situation and restore at least relative stability in my view it is not too late to avert mass bloodletting and new victims the georgian leadership needs to come to its senses and return to civilized means for resolving difficult political problems i also think that the international community should not remain uninvolved when the fate of hundreds of thousand of people is being decided and that it is simply obligated to express its fundamental view of the current situation in the region
4555585 only the websites editors can decide on it being shut down but they were not involved in the trial so they are not planning to abide by it
4555586 an attempt to silence the last independent voice in the republic
4555587 the accusation of extremism is just a pretext for gagging a website that reports allegations of corruption implicating national figures its editor was forced to flee russia after being threatened by the authorities we condemn this harassment and we call for the immediate reopening of the site
4555588 malsagova contacted us through the internet and said she was in france and would ask for political asylum
4555589 i do not know at what stage the process is now she has already submitted some papers
4555590 she figured out that it would be better for her and her three children whom she is raising all by herself to leave the country
4555591 so far neither tbilisi nor washington have turned to us with any requests or proposals
4555592 russia has been firing up hostility between georgia abkhazia and south ossetia for the last several years
4555593 the russian leadership also acts like fascist thugs that kill caucasians on the streets of russian cities
4555594 we should concentrate on driving the russian colonialists who killed us for centuries out of the caucasus
4555595 only then will real peace be restored in the caucasus
4555596 governmental crisis due to criminal acts related to the redistribution of assets
4555597 the threat of terror in russia presently is very high
4555598 where we have four suppliers we will go to two where we have two we will go to one
4555599 if we used to build 7 500 trucks a day and we are now building 3 750 we need to adjust
4555600 if anyone can save the struggling fashion house its the man they just signed to be creative director of the companys flagship brand you can be sure he didnt come cheap but hes just what they need after all this is the guy who actually managed to make tgt a cool place to shop for clothes

4555603 while there are a few older players still available in the free agent market right now were hesitant to make any more moves until we see where we are at training camp
4555604 im 100 percent more optimistic about our chances as i was going into last season
4555605 last season i came in here and the goal was just to make us respectable again and establish a positive work ethic and weve done that the culture has changed here on and off the ice
4555606 to me this is a playoff team we expect to make it this year and thats not just a wish or a dream weve addressed our two biggest needs acquiring a no 1 center brian mcgrattan and were ready to go
4555607 hes got to come in hungry and show us hes had enough of playing in the american league
4555608 im going to go to training camp with the mind set that i can play at this level
4555609 im in good shape and i know i can play at this level and i want to prove to the coaching staff that im ready for a full season in the nhl
4555610 dont think youre going to find a sweet little chicago deal out here they dont exist
4555611 i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
4555612 i dont know why he feels that he has to exaggerate and make some of this stuff up
4555613 he didnt look good to me and i knew this could be it
4555614 i said hey bernard how are you and i kissed his forehead
4555615 he shrugged his shoulders like im tired and i said i know youre tired later on that night it took a turn for the worse
4555616 i got a letter from a girl who said she was listening to one of my songs and every time i hit a particular high note the garage door would open or close
4555617 have i ever been totally and completely intimidated by another person yes my husbands mother
4555618 theres brilliant jazz miles davis and theres brilliant rock coldplay and theres brilliant rap jiggaman
4555619 im thinking of getting a tattoo of him on my chest
4555620 ive got to suggest his voice and his speech without making a fool of myself
4555621 ive been working out really hard lately cause im single now and ive gotta look good
4555622 when i come home from a club my wish is to have a huge bowl of frosted flakes i only have it once in a blue moon because i cant have just one bowl
4555623 the doctor came in and i said hes gone isnt he

4555626 all you can do is admit that youre wrong and know that shes always right

4555631 with photoshop elements im able to capture memories that are very special to me in my life and create beautiful works of art
4555632 i suspected something when i found the first bird in gabon since it didnt exactly match any of the species descriptions in the field guides
4555633 once i was able to compare them side by side to other specimens in our collections it was clear that these birds were special you of course have to be cautious but i was still very excited at the prospect of possibly having found a new species of bird
4555634 finding the olive backed forest robin strongly underscores the importance of our research this helps us show the conservation importance of the area
4555635 although finding an unknown species like the olive backed forest robin was not the goal of the mab project
4555636 it is definitely a reminder that the world still holds surprises for us
4555637 i suspected something when i found the first bird in gabon since it didnt exactly match any of the species descriptions in the field guides
4555638 once i was able to compare them side by side to other specimens in our collections it was clear that these birds were special
4555639 companies like hostess and nestle are perpetuating rainforest destruction and human rights abuses by using palm oil in their products
4555640 our goal is to educate consumers and work with companies who use palm oil in their products to stop destroying rainforests if americans knew the extent to which their food and common household items were contributing to rainforest destruction theyd probably think twice before buying them
4555641 there were many times i didnt pray for another day and i didnt pray for another hour i prayed for another minute to keep going
4555642 theres no doubt that my faith was strengthened and reinforced and tested because sometimes you have a tendency to say why am i here
4555643 we knew we had to have some belief greater than ourselves
4555644 we decided we needed to be all on the same sheet of music at least one time during the week
4555645 yea though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death we will fear no evil
4555646 we agreed that we were going to have a church service and told the vietnamese and they said no
4555647 the vietnamese broke in and seized the people who were standing against the wall doing the service
4555648 they marched them out of the room at gunpoint so i stood up and started singing the star spangled banner god bless america my country tis of thee and every song we could think of
4555649 we wanted to actually just have a chance to do what we felt was a fundamental human right and we got spiritual comfort from being able to worship together
4555650 we thought look if were going to be together then were going to stand up theyd done so many bad things that we werent nearly as afraid of them as maybe we would have been if a lot of us hadnt gone through what wed gone through
4555651 render unto caesar what is caesars and render unto god what is gods
4555652 what i was trying to tell my fellow prisoners is that we were doing caesars work when we got into prison so we should ask for gods help to do the right thing and for us to get out of prison if it be gods will for us to do so
4555653 the god we had come to know wasnt going to wave a magic wand and poof we would all be free the god we knew would give us the strength to endure what we had to do and it was up to us to take that strength and knowledge and do what we had to do
4555654 i recall it as if it happened an hour ago
4555655 it was cold the guards were looking through the windows at us the room was dimly lit because of the light bulbs that were in each corner these guys had beautiful voices im telling you one was a bass one was a tenor it was one of the most beautiful experiences i ever had
4555656 it was because they were so happy to be able to celebrate christmas with fellow americans
4555657 te occidere possunt sed te edere non possunt nefas est
4555658 while at linuxworld at the moscone center in san francisco i chaired the panel on what the oems original equipment manufacturers that are pre installing linux on their pcs are up to and i attended another panel on what the linux desktop architects have planned
4555659 what does linux need to do to compete more successfully on the desktop
4555660 one thing i didnt talk much about in my recent feature article about the future of linux was whether consumers will be paying for linux apps in four years truth is i dont think most of them will if even any at all
4555661 cara o varian poderia se chamar star wars epis dio vii a vingan a dos agentes racionais que num ia fazer diferen a nenhuma
4555662 i was lucky to come back and find this competition which presented an opportunity as the idea i had for a film fit nicely into the competition theme eighteen years in windhoek
4555663 then i formed a partnership with horst and we decided to link our common ideas for story telling and create a company dedicated to telling namibian stories
4555664 the moment i finished the script we started to work on how we would shoot the film seeking out locations the moment we got the grant it sped up our efforts to plan the production we are looking at possibly shooting in the first week of september at this point we are in the process of casting the film
4555665 art direction is very important for this production because we are showing one location over a period of 18 years so we have to make sure that we stay true to each period it will be quite challenging
4555666 i am getting the best help i can get because of productions like the nujoma film and the nbc ties that bind series there are people gaining skills and experience
4555667 its important for us to work with as many different people in the industry as possible its important that we continue to create jobs for each other as there are not that many of us within the industry
4555668 dissatisfied with the health care status quo and rightfully so
4555669 for too many families is unstable and the provision of health care is often inefficient bureaucratic and of low quality
4555670 still have good insurance and ready access to some of the finest medical institutions in the world
4555671 first rule of health legislation like medicine should be do no harm
4555672 moreover our health care system is too big too complex and too dynamic for washington politicians to fix in one piece of legislation
4555673 impose a job killing play or pay tax on every american employer require all insurance to meet federally imposed standards stand up a government run insurance option built on arbitrary price controls with tens of millions of enrollees and pile massive new federal entitlements on top of the unaffordable ones he does nothing about
4555674 too much centralized government control would put quality care at risk
4555675 favors a decentralized reform with families exercising more power and control over their health care decisions
4555676 would convert todays tax preference for employer paid premiums into a refundable tax credit which would foster the competition to deliver better coverage and services at a lower cost
4555677 even if mr mccain wins the presidential election it will be difficult to pass a market oriented plan in a democratic congress
4555678 offer realistic options for covering segments of the uninsured even as they continue to push for the mccain reform vision
4555679 employers arranged for the coverage to be funded in advance well before the financial distress of unemployment hits
4555680 believed to be the nations only chinese centric autistic focused center
4555681 help fellow asians who were raised to feel ashamed of disabilities
4555682 provide a fun cultural and helpful experience for predominantly autistic kids and their parents of chinese heritage
4555683 i think weve really changed the mindset of the chinese community theyre more open to come out and stop being closet families with special needs children
4555684 if internet access is sketchy work around it if the american speed skater and activist joey cheek has his visa revoked on the eve of the games deal with it if there is evidence against the chinese gymnasts beyond the usual olympic suspicions dont believe it
4555685 jerry brought a rare combination of creativity intelligence wit artistic sensibility and business savvy to the evolution of atlantic from a small independent label into a major industry force
4555686 this is unreal youd think that the only things in life that mattered were that a woman was speaker of the house and that democrats were gaining ground
4555687 if you leave the premises we wont have to arrest you
4555688 the laptop i have to take out of the bag and put it separately
4555689 less time is spent putting things in the bin and putting things back in at the other end so it may help the process along
4555690 i will try to be very clear over the barry situation everyone has been talking and it seems that the blame is put on me i get blamed for everything for global warming to high petrol prices but in this case i want to be very clear since i talked to martin oneill about the situation in april i have not talked to anyone at aston villa all the talks have been between our chief executive rick parry the owner and the chief executive of aston villa and those talks have all been pretty good so if anyone wants to talk about barry in the future they must talk with the owner rick parry or the chief executive of aston villa and as i have said those talks i understand have been good i was not involved in the talks about barry i was not involved in the talks about xabi alonso and arsenal if you want to talk about these players you must talk to the chief executive of our club who was handling the discussions if you want to talk about players then you talk to rick parry if you want to talk about football then you talk with me
4555691 the loneliest trumpet sound you will ever hear and the model for sad core music ever since hear it and weep
4555692 i went to paris again 1956 and it was during this trip that i met french filmaker louis malle through juliette greco he told me he had always loved my music and that he wanted me to write the musical score for his new film lascenseur pour lechafaud i agreed to do it and it was a great learning experience because i had never written a music score for a film before i would look at the rushes of the film and get musical ideas to write down since it was about a murder and was supposed to be a suspense movie i used this old gloomy dark building where i had the musicians play i thought it would give the music atmosphere and it did
4555693 ronaldo is a manchester united player and as long as hes a manchester united player we must respect that and honour the clubs wishes
4555694 mr tandy is a client of ours and we are in the process of launching civil proceedings as a result of the assault by joey barton our client has suffered a major psychiatric deterioration in his health that has destroyed any chance he may have had of playing professional football at a high level understandably this is a high profile case and at this stage we are unable to comment further

4555698 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
4555699 if you deploy missile interceptors in poland we will attack poland
4555700 we only respect one authority and that authority is the president of russia
4555701 to announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile but is morally treasonable to the american people
4555702 government has a final responsibility for the well being of its citizenship if private cooperative endeavor fails to provide work for willing hands and relief for the unfortunate those suffering hardship from no fault of their own have a right to call upon the government for aid and a government worthy of its name must make fitting response
4555703 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors
4555704 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
4555705 all men having power ought to be distrusted to a certain degree
4555706 i believe in human dignity as the source of national purpose in human liberty as the source of national action in the human heart as the source of national compassion and in the human mind as the source of our invention and our ideas it is i believe the faith in our fellow citizens as individuals and as people that lies at the heart of the liberal faith for liberalism is not so much a party creed or set of fixed platform promises as it is an attitude of mind and heart a faith in mans ability through the experiences of his reason and judgment to increase for himself and his fellow men the amount of justice and freedom and brotherhood which all human life deserves
4555707 should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are a few other texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or business man from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid
4555708 was just interesting as hell i mean you know compared to most people who kind of go through life vainly making their
4555709 and you liked him you liked him i liked him when i was with him more than i did when i was thinking about him heh heh
4555710 man i am so ready to play b a baracus i really want it to happen and its the thing weve been talking about lately
4555711 wrap text in a box word by word as it scrolls in
4555712 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
4555713 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4555714 i can tell you from my experience that most of the time media speculation turns out to be wrong
4555715 im staying as governor whether you like it or not
4555716 the lieutenant governor might not like it very much but im staying
4555717 between one candidate john mccain who has always put the country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate who has not
4555718 liberals are more self centered than conservatives conservatives are more generous and charitable than liberals liberals are more envious and less hardworking than conservatives conservatives value truth more than liberals and are less prone to cheating and lying liberals are more angry than conservatives conservatives are actually more knowledgeable than liberals liberals are more dissatisfied and unhappy than conservatives
4555719 held on 260 000 00 bond on charges including cocaine possession attempt to sell cocaine and traffic charges
4555720 still there are a few high profile names outstanding al gores most of all though a democratic involved in planning
4555721 not in favour of traditional marriage and i pray that we wont get stuck with him
4555722 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
4555723 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
4555724 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
4555725 a great slideshows is determined by the type of interaction a presenter has with their slides
4555726 if the presenter is addicted to reading bullet points then everyone in the room suffers
4555727 we can keep blaming software for the putrid output but in reality we need to take responsibility
4555728 as communicators learning to create visual stories that connect with our audience is becoming imperative especially in light of global competitive pressure
4555729 i dont think the people of the city of detroit should be represented by a person wearing prison clothes or wearing a tether
4555730 the focus of our convention should be on barack obama and how the party intends to get america back on track not on a distraction involving the troubles of one individual
4555731 the nomination of senator obama at the democratic national convention will be a historic event however im focused on running the city and i dont want anything to distract from that extraordinary moment
4555732 the focus should remain on uniting the party and leading our great nation in a different direction
4555733 thats up to him in terms of all the things he has to deal with
4555734 hes a credentialed delegate and hes entitled to be there
4555735 i want to first acknowledge your great mayor kwame kilpatrick
4555736 thats not the kind of change the american people are hoping for
4555737 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
4555738 yes i can say that they patched the most serious of the vulnerabilities but i cannot confirm that they have patched or havent patched the other two
4555739 if you look at our timeline youll see that there was some disagreement about whether the two bugs were security bugs
4555740 the war was my fault 9 11 was my fault anytime something bad happens a new death toll in the war or whatever my e mails start getting filled up again
4555741 i understand why people care but its like weve got to move on
4555742 i guess you can guess who im not endorsing not supporting
4555743 garbage collectors would inspect san francisco residents trash to make sure pizza crusts arent mixed in with chip bags or wine bottles under a proposal by mayor gavin newsom
4555744 jimmy i dont want you playing with the williams boys anymore their family doesnt recycle
4555745 we now live in a society where sunday church attendance is down but people wouldnt dream of missing their weekly trek to the altar of the recycling center
4555746 we must pull together and support the candidate for president who is on our side barack obama this is at the core of what it means to be a member of our union
4555747 theres not a single good reason for any worker especially any union member to vote against barack obama
4555748 theres only one really bad reason to vote against him because hes not white
4555749 were going straight at our people and talking to them about the differences between mccain and obama and the fact that race could be an issue you go straight at it
4555750 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years
4555751 i want them to know i am sorry it has taken a great toll on them
4555752 somewhere along the way i lost my path i made horrible decisions
4555753 this is a sad case its obvious that you have good skills
4555754 you destroyed the most valuable asset that you possess your good name
4555755 he was not saying oh im sorry i was arrested
4555756 his crime wasnt just ripping people off hes left a trail of devastation in his wake boarded up buildings are going to stay that way for years to come thats what hes done for his community
4555757 what we think is we need to have a real debate about the issue and that includes a real look at the costs of some of the policies being promoted
4555758 lets look at taking whatever revenue is derived from that and devote it entirely to tax relief
4555759 we think that there are solutions to whatever the climate crisis may be that are market based that dont involve increasing the size of government substantially
4555760 do we want to create a model where the solutions for dependence on oil come out of europe or asia and were sitting here in the u s because we want to argue for the status quo
4555761 the scientific data show the change is accelerating so when you do take measures the longer you delay the more aggressive those measures have to be
4555762 its important to address those issues sooner rather than later
4555763 if the united states congress would have the backbone enough to announce to this world that we are going to deregulate and we are going to begin to drill and refine american oil we would begin to see gas prices plummet
4555764 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4555765 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4555766 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4555767 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4555768 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4555769 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4555770 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4555771 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4555772 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4555773 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4555774 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4555775 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4555776 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4555777 i wont accept it because i cant accept it because i dont what else ill do if this fails
4555778 i will fight tooth and nail against anyone who tries to make me accept it because i will be too lost if this doesnt happen
4555779 okay im not going to be president but how about vice president or something so i dont have to face having nothing
4555780 its all real its not a bad dream i am lost and dont feel like doing anything else everybody just leave me alone
4555781 okay i guess i dont have nothing i still have my family i still have people who believed in me i still have a job in the senate i can still make a difference
4555782 my core value and life has been to be of service my daddy did and so have i for most of my adult life i like being an educator on the problems of global warming but i may actually have more leverage to help that and other initiatives as president and besides i will agree if elected to only serve one term where one of my most important roles is to mentor barack obama to be the real president who makes change happen after i leave office in 2012
4555783 christopher doesnt see women for what they should be he sees women for who they can be
4555784 what do you want your look to say to people
4555785 62 of all americans are part of a wireless mobile population that participates in digital activities away from home or work
4555786 gender stereotypes trump race stereotypes in every social science test
4555787 the deal is that women generally fall into two alternatives they are seen as either nice but stupid or smart but mean
4555788 contact doesnt undermine these stereotypes and it might even strengthen them
4555789 many people dont believe seeing women as kind or soft is a stereotype theyre not going to question it because they believe its a good thing
4555790 the measure of a civilization is how it treats those who have hurt it
4555791 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4555792 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4555793 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on iser claims the mccain campaign has a track record of using music without permission made them stop and he used an abba song and a frankie valli song its ridiculous and its setting a terrible example
4555794 its shocking that they dont even attempt to get permission theres no copyright difference between using a song to sell cars or by people running for president the music industry continues to suffer due to lack of respect for intellectual property rights and a candidate for president has a duty to lead by example and ensuring their campaign does as well the copyright protections are derived from the constitution itself
4555795 why it makes a difference public figures on their faith
4555796 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie
4555797 speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace rural development telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high speed universal networks
4555798 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
4555799 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
4555800 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
4555801 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
4555802 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
4555803 these robotic policemen wiped out all of cambridge in one day of carnage what have you got to say about that
4555804 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4555805 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4555806 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4555807 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
4555808 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
4555809 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
4555810 kerry himself is already implementing the lessons of 2004 the massachusetts senator launched a website wednesday truth fights back challenging the assertions in corsis book
4555811 believe obamas senior aides must figure out how to effectively and directly respond to the book
4555812 initially wanted to respond directly to the charges but his top circle of advisers after heated debate counseled against it former senior advisers have said in the subsequent weeks that august as the national media picked up the story and began constantly looping the ads kerrys campaign reversed itself and went on the offensive today within kerrys circle and outside it the view is that the response was too late
4555813 recent reports on obamas florida spending which easily overwhelms john mccains suggest that the sunshine state remains at least at this point the democratic nominees top pickoff target for 2008 much as it was for john kerry in 2004 and al gore in 2000
4555814 heres the math since the start of the general election season obama has dropped 6 51 million a full 18 percent of his overall ad spending and by the largest chunk of change allotted to any one state to broadcast 10 000 commercials on florida television mccains total disbursement 0 zero ads meanwhile chicago has sent more than 200 full time staffers and signed up at least 150 000 online volunteers to man the states 35 field offices the most of any battleground mccains local staff is a quarter of the size and much of it is shared with the state party
4555815 if obama can win florida on nov 4 which george w bush carried by five points in almost guaranteed to win the white house
4555816 the simple fact is that at least two of the candidates mccain is thinking very seriously about picking as his second in command tom ridge and sen joe lieberman i conn who are publicly in favor of abortion rights a third potential candidate former massachusetts gov mitt romney was supportive of abortion rights until a few years ago although he has now adopted a solidly pro life position
4555817 but there isnt a whole lot of love lost between the two groups would mccain picking a pro choice vice president inflame these critical voters who have largely held their collective tongues to this point or will ardently pro life voters make a pragmatic decision and stay behind mccain under the belief that the arizona senator would be a far better president for the issues important to them than would obama
4555818 i can remember being one of a small group of people who came to bill ayers house to learn that alice palmer was stepping down from the senate and running for congress
4555819 delegates will be compelled to sleep five and six and perhaps more in a room
4555820 and in a good many instances two delegates will have to occupy the same bed
4555821 the men here are less prosperous looking than those who gathered for the republican convention in chicago they more obviously represent the masses the farmer element is everywhere distinguishable the majority of the delegates come from the soil and they look it
4555822 the mccain campaign relies on big money lobbyists and theyll rely on him
4555823 in the you scratch my back world of washington 931 million gets the special interests the best government money can buy but just think of the payday these lobbyists might expect in a mccain administration
4555824 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4555825 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4555826 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4555827 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4555828 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4555829 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4555830 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4555831 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair
4555832 and in the same election thank you for this miracle diebold
4555833 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4555834 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4555835 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4555836 while being a parliamentary secretary for three years was interesting it was interesting in the way being governor of syria in the roman empire was interesting you wouldnt knock it back but you could think of postings to which you would rather be appointed
4555837 people were making subtle and not so subtle remarks about what they worried i would speak on indigenous australians hanson politics i was getting messages left right and centre about what i shouldnt say i was being warned effectively
4555838 you can be as empathetic as you like you can have any amount of listening tours and you can invite everyone to say something the perception will be that you listen but eventually you have to make a decision a decision that might alienate half the people youve listened to
4555839 like me or loathe me you know what i stand for
4555840 he offered middle australia the opportunity to get financial security and after the massacre at port arthur which had a huge impact personal security
4555841 the road map the agenda if you like that we came into government with in 1996 had almost been fully realised there was a sense the government had run out of inspiration
4555842 if you factor in non cash benefits provided by the government the figures would tilt even more in favour of thepoor
4555843 all the things we fretted about 10 years ago like unemployment the collapse of traditional industries multiculturalism immigration we had moved on from partly because government policy had changed things in ways that made people feel better these were not a problem any more but this means that other issues come up for people to be less contented about
4555844 david hickss dad stood there and told it like it was
4555845 it didnt come up in the election when hicks was released it was away overnight but it fed into a perception that we lacked compassion like multiculturalism some of our reactions toterrorism security legislation and not signing kyoto
4555846 the fact that we didnt ratify kyoto was interpreted by a lot of people as meaning we were blind to the serious dangers confronting us in the future which would impact on our children
4555847 we hit those families particularly the single mums with the child support changes that came into effect on july 1 2008 which is basically a reduction in the money to be paid by the father its terrible and i fought against that welfare to work was the right thing to do but it was severely affected by the timing and the third issue was work choices the ads were deceitful but it didnt matter
4555848 he got it wrong and he knew he got it wrong
4555849 not even mal brough minister for indigenous affairs knew about that speech it was a desperate attempt to correct history
4555850 as a political movement we are thought to have a good head but a suspect heart
4555851 do any of the parishioners of mary magdalene parish in rose bay feel they are jointly and separately liable for the sacking of constantinople of course they dont
4555852 the vice presidency is the most important decison i can make before i become president this will be my final councelor in the white house
4555853 that is about as lucrative a program as ive ever heard of
4555854 you wouldnt be able to find that anywhere in corporate america or elsewhere
4555855 i lose more money than i make during the session our work is a 365 day a year job so there has to be recognition of that
4555856 we must take that last long jump to universal availability
4555857 if you believe it is a priority why wouldnt you fully fund it
4555858 i think just about every other state in the union offers it
4555859 it is outright unacceptable that the daniels administration turned its back on the states most vulnerable hoosiers of low income children adults and seniors opting instead to forge ahead with another attempt to privatize more of indiana all under the guise of savings
4555860 ive been going over jills plan and im tremendously impressed
4555861 why is the size of your premium determined by the size of your business thats just not right im going to make it possible for small businesses to negotiate lower insurance rates like big companies
4555862 jon stated stay out all night sleep all day because that is what i would be doing by saying this jon really emphasized taking advantage of every day
4555863 how it was lived thats what matters in our memory and in the world to come
4555864 you have in my view achieved the highest level of citizenship raised a good son
4555865 i think that its a very significant statement by speaker nancy pelosi last night that to use her words the house can have a vote on more domestic drilling this represents evidence that the democratic leadership is hearing from the american people is hearing from many democrats in the congress who would like an opportunity to vote on more domestic drilling and i welcome it but i still believe congress should not wait until this fall or sometime around christmas after the elections to give the american people more access to american oil
4555866 it would be better to give less of a raise and have jobs than give bigger raises and then in a year have to cut
4555867 should the assessing duties of the elected township assessor in the township be transferred to the county assessor
4555868 porter county is not an island its not a gulag
4555869 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4555870 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
4555871 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
4555872 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
4555873 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
4555874 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
4555875 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
4555876 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
4555877 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
4555878 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
4555879 it felt like history in the making one of those landmark films that people will be talking about for ever
4555880 we were always frustrated that people saw cg computer generated imagery as a genre as opposed to just a medium that could tell any kind of story we felt like we widened the palette with
4555881 i dont have much of a political bent and the last thing i want to do is preach i just went with things that i felt were logical for a possible future and supported the point of my story which was the premise that irrational love defeats lifes programming and that the most robotic beings ive met are us
4555882 its a wake up call telling people that the stewardship of the planet is a simple human responsibility but also that its a humans responsibility to live their life themes are not just topical theyre universal if you dont take action and you dont take responsibility and you dont exert your humanity you can lose it thats a timeless message but its not one you see in hollywood movies every day
4555883 our 14 offices are part of a highly structured volunteer heavy plan to win in new hampshire
4555884 we are creating neighborhood teams with volunteers who are trained equipped and empowered to build a campaign organization in their own neighborhood
4555885 i think weve built on that grass roots effort from 2004
4555886 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
4555887 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
4555888 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
4555889 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
4555890 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
4555891 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
4555892 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
4555893 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
4555894 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
4555895 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
4555896 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
4555897 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
4555898 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
4555899 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
4555900 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
4555901 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
4555902 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
4555903 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
4555904 i also agree that the worlds problems arent caused by global warming
4555905 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
4555906 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
4555907 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
4555908 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
4555909 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4555910 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
4555911 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4555912 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
4555913 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
4555914 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4555915 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4555916 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4555917 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4555918 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4555919 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4555920 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4555921 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4555922 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4555923 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4555924 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4555925 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4555926 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4555927 leave every reader with the hope that the old battle between business and the environment can reach a peaceful and constructive conclusion
4555928 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4555929 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4555930 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4555931 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4555932 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4555933 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4555934 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4555935 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4555936 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4555937 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4555938 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4555939 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4555940 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4555941 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4555942 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4555943 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
4555944 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4555945 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4555946 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4555947 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4555948 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4555949 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4555950 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4555951 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4555952 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4555953 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4555954 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4555955 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4555956 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4555957 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4555958 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4555959 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4555960 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4555961 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4555962 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4555963 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4555964 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4555965 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4555966 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4555967 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4555968 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4555969 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4555970 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4555971 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4555972 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4555973 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4555974 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4555975 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
4555976 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4555977 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
4555978 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4555979 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4555980 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4555981 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
4555982 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
4555983 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
4555984 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4555985 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
4555986 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
4555987 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
4555988 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
4555989 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
4555990 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
4555991 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
4555992 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4555993 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4555994 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
4555995 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
4555996 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
4555997 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4555998 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
4555999 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
4556000 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
4556001 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
4556002 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
4556003 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
4556004 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
4556005 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
4556006 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
4556007 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
4556008 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
4556009 overall the user experience is excellent beyond the well thought out navigation a key part of the experience owes to microsoft silverlight which enables totally new broadband video capabilities picture in picture 4 live concurrent streams zero buffer rewinding and of course glorious video quality even in large screen mode are all breakthroughs so far i havent seen or heard about any delivery or viewing glitches
4556010 one week in the first broadband olympics are redefining broadbands potential and setting a new quality bar for future events
4556011 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
4556012 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
4556013 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
4556014 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
4556015 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
4556016 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
4556017 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
4556018 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
4556019 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
4556020 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
4556021 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
4556022 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
4556023 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
4556024 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
4556025 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
4556026 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
4556027 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
4556028 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
4556029 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
4556030 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
4556031 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
4556032 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
4556033 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
4556034 pre conception and pre natal diagnostic techniques prohibition of sex selection act
4556035 this year youll see an even bigger difference because of the economy
4556036 this year the sales tax holiday is sure to be much needed and much appreciated by families shopping for school clothes and fall wardrobes
4556037 the main benefit is the tax savings on top of the fact that retailers have aggressive promotions
4556038 the holiday is always a good incentive to bring shoppers back downtown and take advantage of great offers that a lot of the stores have
4556039 downtown has everything from national retailers like bass shoes factory outlet chicos izod van heusen and a number of independents like douglas mens store footsies ha bas cruz cortez intima boutique nefertiti and many more
4556040 were expecting big crowds for the holiday weekend especially with gas prices right now
4556041 we would expect that a lot of people in the houston metro area who might have traveled further will take advantage of having great beaches and shopping on galveston island
4556042 we followed up as many leads as we had we always considered moore a person of interest but back in 2003 we didnt have enough to make the case
4556043 the article came out in the paper and based on that we started getting new leads
4556044 because our technology clarifies water without the use of membranes we have captured the attention of interested parties from around the world some have admitted their skepticism that they dont believe that our claims are possible through our operations and testing through this week and the following accredited lab reports we intend to make believers out of even the most discriminating observers the economical processing methods we use may open doors of possibilities for thirsty communities and companies around the world who simply wont accept unsafe drinking water any longer
4556045 in my mind it will stop the shredding of the fabric of our community we must put opportunities in front of our children so that they can go to work and earn a living
4556046 to object to what you call government welfare is your privilege but its not something i can agree with
4556047 i hope you recognize that all the people who have spoken are giving a consistent message we are united together
4556048 this agreement is a tremendous breakthrough in the development of the s gen tm we have been very cautious in selecting gps software to use on our flagship product and garmin is a world leader in gps satellite navigation there is no one better and we are looking forward to a long business relationship with such an outstanding company
4556049 we felt there was sufficient evidence to back it up
4556050 freely sharing with him confidential proprietary and trade secret information
4556051 a jury made a decision and now we have to deal with that
4556052 we are definitely on a decline curve where we will be spending more than we are raising now
4556053 use of the word obese shuts people down they associate it with 10 tonne mums and half tonne kids we have chosen not to use it theres no point giving them a letter that does not have any impact on their behavior
4556054 its the kind of shock word that makes parents sit up and take notice its a nasty word but by god it should sound alarm bells in parents minds
4556055 at least one afrikaner should publicly identify himself with the plight of the people
4556056 we are smart and it is our time to enjoy the fruits of freedom
4556057 we need to make money as much as we can because we are the chosen smart ones
4556058 seriously the life of the mind inhabits an isolated and insulated world
4556059 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4556060 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4556061 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4556062 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4556063 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4556064 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4556065 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4556066 great a somewhat objective analysis of things that senator obama did wrong
4556067 the democrats are right now attempting to violate state election law by creating a loophole that opens the door to vote fraud
4556068 we understand that unprecedented market conditions have created difficulties for our clients particularly those holding auction rate securities

4556072 in many areas with large concentrations of foreclosure sales homes are being purchased below replacement cost values
4556073 many buyers with long term expectations are getting exceptional value in the current market once the inventory is drawn down price pressure will return because the costs of construction are rising
4556074 its easy to assume parliament houses 646 men and women who are all obsessed with ambition and determined to cling to their seats at all costs its healthy to be reminded that just occasionally thats not true
4556075 columbus and atlanta both have been home run markets for our investors and associates

4556080 that since egypt has a great role in the region and in the world it will be able to force israel to comply with what has been agreed
4556081 despite of the fact that all of the factions did not violate the truce and israel continued with its crimes and attacks against the palestinians in the west bank and the gaza strip
4556082 it is affirmed that no party should violate the truce on its own a unified decision of voiding the truce should be taken unanimously by all factions

4556092 when i was in my 30s 50 just seemed so ancient to me
4556093 i was in high school when she hit it big
4556094 now that her first young fans are in their 30s we look at madonna as sort of a harbinger of the future for us and the future looks pretty good
4556095 is that aging is not the inevitability that we might have assumed by watching our fathers now in their 50s and 60s madonna is proof that exercising and eating right at an early age pays off
4556096 i want to know who her doctor is its really hard to believe shes 50 she looks 40 and she just keeps going at it living life and loving life
4556097 put a picture of a 50 year old woman today next to one from my mothers generation
4556098 we look at least 10 to 15 years younger than they did
4556099 also 50 really is a new beginning for so many women
4556100 many have accomplished a number of their goals already their children are getting older for the first time they can really think about themselves and ask what do i want from life
4556101 as the cliche goes i guess its better than the alternative
4556102 i just dont feel like what 50 should feel like
4556103 i remember my grandmother at 50 her hair was completely white my mother too was just at a very different place in her life than i am now
4556104 shes done a remarkable job of marketing herself and shes always been able to reinvent herself
4556105 im sure shes happy to be an inspiration to women and men of any age
4556106 is not quite the benchmark for her as it seems to be in the media who have been talking about her 50th since she turned 40
4556107 the number of artists that he was involved with and helped significantly or just made great records with the list is almost unbelievable
4556108 he loved black music r amp b music and rhythm and blues was his foundation he had a feeling for it he had the knack to keep it going in his heart and recognize the talent that he felt was real
4556109 jerry wexler didnt change the sound of america he put the sound to the public he open the doors and windows to the radio stations and made everybody listen
4556110 no one really knew how to make a record when i started
4556111 you simply went into the studio turned on the mike and said play
4556112 in the early sessions i just sat there watching ertegun while i was cowering in fright
4556113 but as time went on we proved to be a very successful team we went on the road together we hung out together
4556114 wrote many of the songs in the early days and he drew upon his knowledge of jazz and the blues because songs always have to have a source this is not to say that there is not great originality
4556115 when it came to the studio you could say the two of us were joined at the hip
4556116 among my favorite sessions i feel the things we did together were dynamite
4556117 the companys profits and future existence of course wholly depend on its ability to externalize the health effects of its products
4556118 at todays prices the value of oil in the ground exceeds the combined value of all the worlds equity and debt markets
4556119 the tennis players were at a private dinner and the occasion was not an olympic one
4556120 it is a matter for the tennis federation but i understand that it was an innocent situation with no offence being intended
4556121 he didnt look good to me and i knew this could be it
4556122 i said hey bernard how are you and i kissed his forehead
4556123 he shrugged his shoulders like im tired and i said i know youre tired later on that night it took a turn for the worse

4556135 the reaction has been fantastic you do get the odd one two text messages saying what are you up to but the people who mean a lot are really supportive thats all that matters
4556136 i had one in particular who i respect norm hewitt sent a lovely email wishing me all the best and just giving his blessing he was a person i looked up to as a leader and a player we went to the same school and it was so nice to get a message from him
4556137 when i first saw the email from him i thought oh heck he might say something about wearing the england jersey but he told me to go and grab it with both hands and to do my best he said it had been a real honour to play alongside myself to get comments like that was a real boost
4556138 i have no regrets whatsoever about trying to play for england maybe a year ago when the media were talking about it for the first time there were mixed thoughts going through my mind
4556139 i know some good mates had considered doing the same thing jarrod cunningham the former london irish player was also asked some years ago and he turned it down and said he would never wear the rose
4556140 but nowadays in new zealand if a player gets a chance to play at the highest level for another country then people say go for it its a fantastic opportunity and im really looking forward to it
4556141 inevitable exclusion of substantial numbers of faithful anglicans from the church of england
4556142 different decisions should be respected and supported including that of those who have come to believe that fidelity to the faith we have received means that they can no longer remain within the communion of the church of england
4556143 we are faced with apparently irreconcilable differences in matters of faith and order and it is important to try to conduct all conversations and debates in a spirit of generosity even when church dividing issues are at stake
4556144 we have talked for hours about how to give an honorable place for those who disagree

4556177 we do talk to him but its quite a lengthy process when it comes to back and forth communication

4556235 im looking forward to everyone gathering at the gilman garrison and then walking down water street to the folsom tavern along the way well share some stories of early exeter and the gilman families roles in the town what a nice way to spend an early autumn evening
4556236 the gilman garrison is not open on a regular basis so this evening tour is extra special its rare for a group to gather in the evening and experience these historic spaces during the twilight hours the way many before us have done this collaboration with aim is a natural fit for us and im sure our visitors will enjoy learning about the history of exeter through the gilman garrison and the folsom tavern

4556255 part of the reason we didnt get a grocery store is the project youre going to talk about at 8 oclock tonight
4556256 a coffee shop bookstore or diner that sort of thing
4556257 sometimes its very difficult to fully rent out the retail in these new properties
4556258 this is my library and use is as strong on the east side as the west maybe someone never went to this site before developing the proposal theyre turning their back on an amazing opportunity and im very disappointed that hasnt been played up it would be a death knell to this project to ignore how many people come in and out of the library and clinic
4556259 wed like to see a lot of action there people sitting outside throughout high point we have created many places for people to gather
4556260 its hard enough just to turn from 35th onto graham
4556261 an amazing example of addressing environmental concerns as well as getting the community involved rain gardens permeable paving
4556262 high point is such a fantastic example of a project going way out there done well that it would really be a shame for this to turn out looking like everything else out there
4556263 we issued a decision on this project in june a little over a year ago the project went through the whole process and its elements are a lot like what you will see tonight but what we were left with was a desire for dpd to work with the applicant on refinements in design the applicants graciously did that and then pursued it even further after we had issued our decision and began vigorous re examination of a lot of things with a new architectural firm we encouraged them because i think they were resolving and addressing some issues not resolved earlier on for whatever the merits of what you will see tonight its had a remarkable redo so the department felt in fairness to the board and the public which had seen it pre makeover we should bring it back for you to see and approve
4556264 the previous design had allotted 440 square feet per stall
4556265 we have it down to 340 square feet per stall we had to make it financially viable
4556266 i hope the decreased parking wont make it so undesirable that people will choose to park on the street that would be a huge detriment to our neighborhood
4556267 the midblock entrance is nice but nowhere near what needs to be done there is nothing that invites me as a pedestrian to go into that entrance right now theres just one tiny little glass door if it was a garage door type opening that would open up the facade much better

4556270 what makes you so special to all those other writers out there
4556271 what the body knows and the mind chooses to believe are two different things
4556272 with some of this sharp price collapse in commodities you would think the market would be up a lot more
4556273 the underlying factor is that credit continues to appear to be very weak
4556274 at the beginning of this year earnings expectations started to drop precipitously and the stock market dropped with them
4556275 those expectations got built into the stock market and to an excess a lot of stocks discounted all of the bad news that was out there
4556276 its a fabulous market for trader types that play off all this volatility but long term investors are still scared

4556279 you should be ashamed of yourself being with a man with the last name white you should not be a part of this
4556280 i just wanted to step on it in the first 50 meters a little bit and try and get out to an early lead
4556281 i knew that was a hard double for ryan i knew in the first half if i got a big enough lead i thought i could hang on and thats all i wanted to do
4556282 if he wasnt in this sport and swimming i dont think id be as good
4556283 he is up there and he makes me become better and stronger in training without him i wouldnt be standing here today i think i push him as well
4556284 for me to be a player in that race i have to be closer at the 50
4556285 if im not then it will be tough i was over a body length behind at the 50 in the prelims and came up a bit short so i have to be there
4556286 thats the theme of the meet youve got to break a world record to win
4556287 i gave it my all but i had nothing left ryan handed me a great race and i have no regrets
4556288 i can tell you i dont want to be competing when im 40
4556289 that was one of the easiest 50s ive ever done
4556290 we both supported each other 100 percent and we just wanted to go out there and give it our all and have fun because this is the games
4556291 im still chasing him for that medal count but i have three more finals to beat him
4556292 a few months ago i made a board of pictures and other things that inspired me my mom hung one of his medals on the board and it gave me the extra motivation and it made a difference being empowered to see it every day for those few months
4556293 both of my parents have been a big influence on my life my dad is in the gym with me every day hes the reason i am an olympic champion my mom is on my side providing emotional support its an equal effort
4556294 i was so focused during the race i wanted to make sure i got enough laps
4556295 i had no idea i was third if i knew i might freak out
4556296 any time you sneak in on your last throw and squeak out a medal its special
4556297 i didnt win but i moved from sixth to second and thats something
4556298 i had some big throws and big fouls unfortunately they didnt count
4556299 there is not much good to take out of this i was just throwing down the left sector line and i dont really do that often its inexcusable
4556300 we play really hard and our goal here is to win a gold medal thats the only reason why were here we want to do that we want to end up in the gold medal game repeating for that gold medal at the end of this tournament
4556301 i think tonight was a very tough challenge for us offensively and defensively
4556302 i think we got our focus we played against a very tough team in spain this is lessons learned and hopefully we take from this and move on to the next game
4556303 i knew yesterday i was going for it and that no one was going to take it away from me
4556304 the past few days have been a roller coaster ride but not a bad one because i like roller coasters
4556305 its been challenging to keep my head on straight for my own events
4556306 playing in the olympics in whats supposed to be gentlemans sport thats a time to call it on yourself
4556307 fernando looked me square in the eye and didnt call it
4556308 ive tried to play this game for as long as i can
4556309 i make mistakes but i try to do it with integrity so my parents would be proud of the way i played if that happened the other way i never would have finished the match because my father would have pulled me off the court if i had acted that way
4556310 hes too good of a player to do something like that and to act like that theys why its disappointing because he is a great player i cant take anything away from the fact he won the match
4556311 we were on the court like 2 1 2 hours i was really tired i didnt feel anything
4556312 we are on the heels of those who try to cheat that has been the case over the last five or six years
4556313 this is the last time i will be competing with my brother fabrice so it is very special
4556314 i had a belief that i must win this match
4556315 i am not only representing myself i have a responsibility to fight for my country japans judo is the most fantastic but i was fighting for chinas glory
4556316 i wanted to bring home the gold medal but i guess not
4556317 today is indias independence day i have given a gift to the nation in the shape of this victory
4556318 for the gold medal i dedicate it first of all to my motherland and all the people of my country
4556319 but most importantly i want to dedicate this medal to my dear mother who has passed away not long ago
4556320 i deserve the medal because ive trained for 14 years
4556321 i give thanks to the support of my nation my people and my family the good environment and weather at the venue really helped me
4556322 its an honor and privilege to participate in the olympics
4556323 ive been to the olympics three straight times and every time i have finished in the top eight i know i was the only person from both athens and sydney to do that
4556324 the only thing is that im not confident with how the game ended
4556325 i lost my second baseman when the pitcher pedro luis lazo threw the ball at his head i dont see any place for that in baseball i respect the way cuba plays baseball but i dont like losing players
4556326 it takes all the work out of baseball because all you need is a base hit and youve got a good shot to win
4556327 normally you get a guy on first and battle to get home it was strange running out to second from the dugout ive never done that in my life and probably never will again
4556328 i felt really good but this is just the first half the second half will be after the gold medal match
4556329 we knew it was going to be tough playing china at their home all we wanted to do was fight
4556330 although we lost the match every player played their best
4556331 its important we find our problems in the preliminaries and find ways to solve them
4556332 we treat every game seriously it is a great opportunity for us to play another game
4556333 shes such a pro she has had really bad heat rash she has really sensitive skin so i could use no leg on her because she wasnt 100 percent comfortable i have a great team behind me to help her out and she amazes me with what a great competitor she is
4556334 now weve got the cables weve got talk radio weve got the bloggers i hate the bloggers weve got all kinds of sources of information

4556342 what a high school teacher might call a young woman of poise
4556343 people stopped me in the street in cardiff and asked me to stay but i dont think they will blame me for joining one of the traditional mega clubs in british football
4556344 if i wanted to make sure i got somebody who is far better than stephen mcmanus and gary caldwell i would have to pay 15million to 20million and thats not going to happen
4556345 ive signed someone who if monetary value equals quality is five times worse than my current centre backs and will is destined for the reserves
4556346 they enjoyed a good win against derby and they will catch a few teams by surprise but that wont last for long
4556347 alex is starting to pick up my bad driving habits
4556348 i only know what i have i dont know what its like to have a mom like that i only know what its like to have a mom like you so i only want you to be my mom
4556349 voting is the heart of the democratic process and we are pursuing a recount as that is the fairest way possible to make sure the peoples voice through the election is most accurately heard
4556350 i have received encouragement to pursue the recount from an overwhelming number of democratic primary voters at this stage the recount becomes a legal procedure
4556351 lathrop amp gage has handled election recounts like this many times before
4556352 as candidates are able to request a recount whenever their losing margin is less than 1 percentage point and given the slim margin separating the candidates at the top we feel it is in the best interest of the state and of all those who voted to make sure there is no error in tabulating the final results and that the votes of all citizens are counted for this important race
4556353 i didnt think that obama had to do much during his weeks vacation everyone deserves a break
4556354 but this week is starting to really turn into a week where you dont want to be seen golfing
4556355 if i may be so bold there was another president
4556356 at one time there was a president named ronald reagan who spoke very strongly about americas advocacy for democracy and freedom
4556357 we talk about how theres only one president at a time so the idea that you would send your own emissaries and really interfere with the process is remarkable
4556358 its very risky and can send mixed messages to foreign governments they accused obama of being presumptuous but he didnt do anything close to this
4556359 part of a strategic energy corridor affecting individual lives far beyond
4556360 these are the kinds of things that the president should have been saying from the beginning
4556361 you know i think he spends less time on his presidential campaign these days and lots of time on georgia
4556362 and i really appreciate that because senator mccain has been fighting for freedom of georgia for many many years
4556363 time among a large set of competing deformation fields and crack paths
4556364 always begins from defects as the authors of the paper mention
4556365 identical samples is an argument in favor of the nucleation by defects otherwise such a spread would not be expected
4556366 what if you did know is still valid nevertheless and gives some reason to pursue it
4556367 si el ministro de planificaci n le hubiera consultado a mi abuela le hubiera recomendado que usara mentolato que es el milagro que lo cura todo desde la gripe malestares en la garganta dolor de cabeza picadas de insectos y hasta los golpes que es lo nico que le falta a haiman el troudi para combatir la inflaci n

4556372 we are very thankful to tim hortons and the peel paramedic association for donating the bears to our service
4556373 the partnership speaks to the commitment we all have for the well being of peels children
4556374 emergencies involving children are one of the more difficult calls paramedics respond to
4556375 we are pleased to work with tim hortons and the region of peel to give kids a little extra comfort in a frightening situation
4556376 we had lunch with the gov at king davids and hes a really nice kinda bloke
4556377 youre much more interesting to read now that you left the star liberating isnt it
4556378 while the russian government or military may yet be found to be playing a part criminal gangs or savvy computer hackers in russia hackivists may be acting on their own
4556379 hello my name is inigo montoya you killed my father prepare to die
4556380 i have once again become a medium of violence in the world
4556381 inflicted by an evil demon that is nurtured by our so called criminal justice system
4556382 i dont know what god wants for me i just dont know
4556383 in heaven there may be some evidence down in the lolo forest because thats where we were
4556384 the entire nation is watching to see how we handle this
4556385 this is a question of character as well as one of finance
4556386 im just really disgusted with the incompetency of these officials
4556387 i am firmly convinced that bankruptcy or default would irreparably harm this county
4556388 even though its pop culture thrown straight in there it definitely shows a relaxed approach by the north korean government
4556389 we were living in real time on the web and then we get to north korea and were in the dark
4556390 through this we really open doors and have these unique opportunities and that kind of scares politicians
4556391 it would just suck to wind up in a situation you dont want to be in a place like that
4556392 the last place i would want to be is in a north korean police station trying to explain myself
4556393 the world leaders should rethink their strategies maybe they should spend a night in the karaoke bar
4556394 a convicted sexual felon should not be able to live next door to your college student
4556395 theyre living away from home for the first time theyre staying out late i know theyre drinking we need to ensure their safety
4556396 its a real problem to find them a place to live
4556397 people end up living under bridges or in cars we would prefer they have a roof over their heads
4556398 for people to say this isnt a priority because its based on the possibility of harm is just wrong
4556399 for the most part these people have done their time
4556400 were better off educating students and preparing them to take accountability for their own public security
4556401 i think its just a knee jerk reaction to a problem that doesnt exist its going to make things 10 times worse
4556402 hello my name is inigo montoya you killed my father prepare to die
4556403 hello my name is inigo montoya you killed my father prepare to die
4556404 i am your nightmare i am the shape in the dark
4556405 hello my name is inigo montoya you killed my father prepare to die
4556406 i think theyre pretty close to being ready to go dungy said

4556408 hes fine he should be good to go dungy said
4556409 its in roushs back yard and fords back yard so another win there would be huge
4556410 i always say darlington is my favorite racetrack but michigan is becoming a close second
4556411 michigan has a lot of personal history for me and im always glad to go there its where i made my first cup start where i made my 100th start and where i broke a 52 race winless streak with a win in june of last year
4556412 its a great track with some really awesome racing you can pass and i think the fans always see a good show there
4556413 i lived in michigan for a couple of years when i first started racing the trucks for roush in 1998 and 1999
4556414 its always great to win in michigan because its kind of the home track for ford and roush industries
4556415 michigan has always been one of my favorite tracks on the circuit
4556416 its fast and it allows for a lot of passing because it is so wide we won back to back races there in 2004 and 2005 and i think that a win this weekend is a reasonable goal
4556417 michigan is a track that weve been pretty strong at in the past
4556418 michigan and the next several races are some of my favorites for sure michigan bristol fontana and richmond are some of my favorite tracks and i always look forward to this stretch of races
4556419 everyone is going chase crazy these days and are really focusing on points and standings
4556420 for me i just go out every week and try to get the best finish i can if i do that the rest takes care of itself and really it doesnt matter where you are in points until after richmond
4556421 its in roushs back yard and fords back yard so another win there would be huge

4556440 the lincoln mkt reinforces our commitment to further expand americas fastest growing luxury brand providing an all new vehicle to the showroom thats been crafted and honed for a new kind of customer
4556441 the mkt will offer the comfort of a luxury sedan the spaciousness and flexibility of a crossover and the performance of a sports sedan courtesy of its ecoboost engine
4556442 at the same time this perfect blend of performance and power is elegantly wrapped in the refined design cues that have become synonymous with modern lincolns
4556443 ecoboost engine technology is another symbol of what luxury means today
4556444 lincolns should drive as beautifully as they look delivering as much refinement on the road as their designs do even while standing perfectly still
4556445 embracing the same spirit as the concept the lincoln mkts design represents harmony in motion balancing sculptured shapes and contours traditionally associated with beautiful cars on a crossover vehicle that offers the luxury of space and efficient powerful performance
4556446 obviously we are excited to be awarded this new business
4556447 pti looks forward to expanding its illinois business and establishing new operations in missouri iowa and wisconsin
4556448 we are planning the roll in of this new business into our operations with staggered start up dates for the new locations planned through the end of august
4556449 pti continues to experience strong business growth even before this new business pti conducted operations in 21 states i am confident today marks the beginning of a long term and mutually rewarding relationship with north americas largest railroad

4556452 it is a very nice diamond because of its size
4556453 and it has what they call a silver cape on it its about the size of a
4556454 but when you find out who did it let us know were always looking for ideas
4556455 its nice that someone by placing a sticker on an object can make it a piece of art
4556456 this particular piece of guerrilla art seems to have accomplished this lofty goal brilliantly
4556457 but i will tell you i think this is a smart and fun piece of
4556458 ill be the one wearing our new constitution party teeshirt
4556459 in the coming weeks amazon ec2 will be launching a new persistent storage offering
4556460 i think mr deeb has crossed a line somewhere this is not what we would consider to be a customary home occupation
4556461 mr deeb hasnt actually violated any law or regulation that i can find but i dont like what hes doing because im ignorant and irrationally afraid of chemicals
4556462 the so called chemistry sets today which boldly and insanely advertise they contain no chemicals
4556463 this was a cowardly attack on an innocent man who is here in the country working as a volunteer to help us such act reflects badly on us as a nation this should have never happened in the first place
4556464 we must all help get rid of kwaso as it is not needed here i urge all communities to help the police in the fight against kwaso consumption we the police cant do it by ourselves
4556465 its pretty hard to see how its anything other than a straightforward set of copyright violations
4556466 there are entire magazines with no commentary no criticism clearly not a case of classic fair use
4556467 the first sale doctrine says that once i buy a physical copy of something i can do whatever i want with it except copy it
4556468 we take our intellectual property seriously and are considering appropriate action on this matter
4556469 the governor is very busy but he feels that it is necessary to address some of these issues so what weve done is we recorded a message a direct address for the people of the commonwealth
4556470 this could be my chance to break out this could be my chance to say goodbye
4556471 comunque siamo in noi c molto pi di quello che vedi
4556472 soy madre y recientemente termin mi carrera universitaria la ultima clase que tom fue sociolog a la maestra estaba muy inspirada con las cualidades que yo deseaba ver con las cuales cada ser humano hab a sido agraciado
4556473 no lo hice por ustedes dios est aqu actuando a trav s de m para darles esperanza
4556474 es por eso que dios te dio para m cari o para darme esperanza
4556475 we have brought in a new person into the group we have a new guitar player who is playing for the first time tomorrow it is the first time he has been on our stage his name is wes borland he used to be in a very terrible band that he left because he felt it was a destructive force we dont know how permanent that is but starting tomorrow will be the first step
4556476 the slapdash release of morrissey live at the hollywood bowl is done by warner without any consultation to me whatsoever and is in breach of their terms as laid out by themselves in an agreement made for the film between warner and my ex manager
4556477 being warner predictably the sleeve art is appalling it is the work of cash hounds and i urge people not to buy it i am not signed to warner and no royalties from this dvd will come to me please spend your money elsewhere
4556478 der neue motor ist unglaublich obwohl er ein wenig anders ist als das was ich so gekannt habe
4556479 er wurde bis zum maximum entwickelt und die kraftentfaltung ist sehr linear der neue motor f hlt sich ein wenig anders an ist aber auf jeden fall schneller er ist sehr spritzig aber das st rt uns nicht allzu sehr insofern danke ich yamaha uns dieses ding zu tech 3 zugespielt zu haben
4556480 mit den kleinen problemen die ich noch an der vorderachse habe besteht der einzige weg wie ich fahren kann in harten bremsman vern und das ist fast wie damals in der supermoto sobald ich mich mehr in die kurven legen kann kann ich wieder voll aufs gas gehen
4556481 der neue motor ist fantastisch einen gro en dank an yamaha f r diese unterst tzung er f hlt sich einfach st rker an und man hat das gef hl wesentlich progressiver durch die g nge schalten zu k nnen
4556482 und er liefert auch in den h chsten g ngen noch viel leistung das rote gang hochschalt signall mpchen leuchtet viel schneller aus als gew hnlich und man sp rt wie das bike selbst einen berg noch hochjagt das ist auf jeden fall eine gro e verbesserung
4556483 no one really knew how to make a record when i started
4556484 you simply went into the studio turned on the mike and said play
4556485 in the early sessions i just sat there watching ertegun while i was cowering in fright
4556486 but as time went on we proved to be a very successful team we went on the road together we hung out together
4556487 wrote many of the songs in the early days and he drew upon his knowledge of jazz and the blues because songs always have to have a source this is not to say that there is not great originality
4556488 when it came to the studio you could say the two of us were joined at the hip
4556489 among my favorite sessions i feel the things we did together were dynamite
4556490 its clear kilpatrick knew who detective white was he had previous contact with him through his other case
4556491 you should be ashamed of yourself being with a man with the last name white you should not be a part of this
4556492 i know some of our players are excited about wearing the orange jersey
4556493 we think the fans will be excited to see it a couple times as well
4556494 sam tries to focus on lindsay but its never enough
4556495 lindsay has to be the center of attention or shell flirt with other guys to make sam jealous
4556496 god tells us to love each other and love doesnt discriminate
4556497 shell be with the next guy who catches her eye she cant help it
4556498 when i was 12 and had crushes on guys id put my first name with their last name but it never sounded right
4556499 she also says she was shocked to be named one of peoples 100 most beautiful people this year
4556500 oh yeah this is why i am afraid of this
4556501 i am sure every historian archeologist and storyteller is as excited as this as i am
4556502 this announcement and the search for these two vessels has the allure of an indiana jones mystery
4556503 it is a very nice diamond because of its size
4556504 and it has what they call a silver cape on it its about the size of a chiclet gum its rectangular in shape
4556505 jesper klein og andre sendte et indl g i kanal k benhavn om d 9 11 2001 new york
4556506 i think she was just at wits end and wanted some relief from all of it
4556507 bay zheeng wrote kaiser kuo who works for a china based ad agency and wrote an online guide for journalists covering the olympics
4556508 if we cant even pronounce beijing correctly and consistently how can we ever hope to address deeper cross cultural misunderstandings and conflicts
4556509 we wanted him to leave this program with a medal around his neck we came up a bit short
4556510 my feeling is more general disappointment over not playing a better game
4556511 i think this was a game we should have beaten the usa i feel we had more in us
4556512 it has been a wonderful nine years for me and my family and the program
4556513 there has been continual development of the team and for womens soccer in canada
4556514 before that it was just sporadic camps a couple of times a year
4556515 weve been able to have a full time job with this team hes really paved the way for the next coach coming in
4556516 its a shame to hear mens players saying that when they are no where
4556517 you wouldnt know it just seeing him but hes absolutely hilarious
4556518 i dont even know how to put into words what even has meant for this program and canadian womens soccer and to me
4556519 if i had the confidence the courage or the common sense the chutzpa or the happiness then i could face the future
4556520 im proud to be the one you hold when the shakes begin
4556521 hes the world record so really were just chasing him
4556522 for me in preliminaries to be a body length behind at the first 50 wasnt really where i wanted to be
4556523 so i have to try to fix a few things and i think to do that i have to conserve as much physical and emotional energy as i can im down to the last two races im just going to try to rest and recover as much as i can
4556524 ill start by not worrying about what everyone else thinks
4556525 no one knows what ive gone through in the past eight years to get here just me and a few people close to me it is my own personal deal at this point
4556526 hes been around weve seen him swim a long time
4556527 it would be good for the sport if he lost
4556528 lets be honest about that its true its good to lose sometimes i know because ive lost a lot for him what would it mean i would hope that he would cut down his events for the next year and start training more for the 100 fly theres no doubt in my mind thats hes the best will he be the best here i dont know hes got a lot on his plate hopefully that will work out for me
4556529 come on if you didnt look at the camera angle you would have seen that i was firing away from him and above him i was firing at my manager and mentor which is on the serbian team ive got nothing against michael phelps the guy is the king but do i want to make a rivalry of this sure why not but i have never disrespected anybody and im definitely not going to start with michael phelps thats crazy
4556530 it would be kind of nice that one day historically well speak of michael phelps maybe winning seven gold medals and having lost an opportunity to win eight gold medals
4556531 when they talk about that theyll talk about whoever that guy is that took it away from him id love to be that guy
4556532 our intent with windows 7 and the pre release communication is to make sure that we have a reasonable degree of confidence in what we talk about when we do talk

4556566 that price has been shrinking over time and in the next year or so the led backlights will be more competitive once that happens and more lcds use leds for backlighting youll see more savings in power consumption and that will be better for the environment because they dont contain mercury that fluorescent backlights have and they dont wear out at all like fluorescent lights
4556567 and leds deliver more vivid colors and wide color gamut
4556568 they will make for a much better for viewing experience
4556569 i object to violence because when it appears to do good the good is only temporary the evil it does is permanent
4556570 so all i will say is that you have to get to know me and decide for yourself i will let you be the judge not trying to sound corny or clich but someone i can laugh with cry with and grow with we dont have to agree on everything but find some common ground and have understanding
4556571 these weightings help explain why july was one of the worst months on record for hedge funds and why august may not be any better

4556573 there was some interest in converting syngas into ethanol during the first oil crisis back in the 70s
4556574 the problem was that catalysis technology at that time didnt allow selectivity in the byproducts they could produce ethanol but youd also get methane aldehydes and a number of other undesirable products
4556575 the great thing about using syngas to produce ethanol is that it expands the kinds of materials that can be converted into fuels
4556576 you can use the waste product from the distilling process or any number of other sources of biomass such as switchgrass or wood pulp basically any carbon based material can be converted into syngas and once we have syngas we can turn that into ethanol
4556577 interior secretary dirk kempthorne said late monday the changes were needed to ensure that the endangered species act would not be used as a back door to regulate the gases blamed for global warming
4556578 it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
4556579 yes sure the paper is likely to cite sound financial reasons for this decision but really this from a publication that has regularly and rightfully taken local daily newspapers to task for the same type of decisions hmmmm
4556580 this is not a balanced plan only 10 funds roads
4556581 thats why leading democrats republicans and the sierra club all oppose proposition 1
4556582 technically what theyre saying is accurate we did oppose 2007s proposition 1 but theyre definitely trying to use our name and influence to get people to vote against this
4556583 there are many advertisers out there that would like the opportunity to understand what the sports illustrated brand is about what those offerings are that we just physically cant get to
4556584 we used to send e mails out to the sales reps in the boston area saying look were having a commemorative and youve got two days to sell into that
4556585 they could win the bid and actually get it but somebody has to talk to them

4556593 you are dealing with a people who despise anything human
4556594 we need to do our utmost to deter such behavior in the future
4556595 to begin a discussion of the consequences of what russia has done this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics
4556596 its clearly a very emotional time but i think that it should still be seen that this was a productive day i hope now that peace can return to georgia and georgians can return to a normal life
4556597 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4556598 the united states would never ask georgia to sign onto something where its interests were not protected
4556599 because theyll have plenty to talk about as we go through the summer

4556613 i have discovered how to send a liberal screaming and dialing toward a padded cell if i merely quote a liberal approvingly he loses all credibility with his peers and must devote hours and days of effort in distancing himself from me
4556614 any politician who criticizes another politician for being negative is like a man going to a bordello and criticizing the woman for being scantily clad
4556615 i remember back when a liberal was someone who was generous with his own money
4556616 the deficit is like the guy that finds a rattlesnake in his pants he knows hes got to shoot it but he doesnt want to hit anything important

4556624 i sent an urgent request to the russian president through official channels to start negotiations to regulate our relations during military actions like those seen at the start of august
4556625 at least 72 hours prior to ships or aircraft crossing the ukrainian border
4556626 with the signing of this accord all russian troops and any paramilitary and irregular troops that entered with them must leave immediately
4556627 the verbal assurance that president dmitry medvedev gave that russian military operations had stopped clearly was not honoured
4556628 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4556629 moscow must honour its commitment to withdraw its invading forces from all georgian territory
4556630 a significant part of georgian territory remains under foreign military occupation
4556631 never ever will georgia reconcile itself with the occupation of even one square kilometre of its territory
4556632 if someone continues to attack our citizens our peacekeepers then of course we will answer just as we did

4556648 hmm i really need this ak 47 but america has a law that only law enforcement can use firearms i guess i should just leave it here
4556649 your military time is taking up too much of my time i suggest you drop the class or i can fail you
4556650 so you have to understand what i mean when i say i want to make washington d c and the rest of our country more like texas because frankly we know the policies that actually work
4556651 texas has plenty of qualities to brag about but access to health care is not one of them in fact cornyn was among a minority in the senate opposing the expansion of the childrens health insurance program which today covers nearly half a million texas children but could reach hundreds of thousands more with added funding if top elected officials continue to view a sick system as a role model and vote against expanded health insurance for our children that change will be a long time coming
4556652 the concept behind insurance is simple you pay a little bit now so you are covered in case of a disaster if someone pays for health insurance therefore they should be covered when they get sick instead the insurance industry has made huge profits denying people care whenever they can the system in texas exemplifies the trend with the highest rate of uninsured in the nation its a broken system not a model for the country and it needs to be fixed

4556674 congress should not be on vacation while americans dont have a vacation from high energy prices
4556675 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4556676 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4556677 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4556678 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4556679 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4556680 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4556681 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4556682 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4556683 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4556684 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4556685 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4556686 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4556687 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4556688 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4556689 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4556690 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4556691 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4556692 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4556693 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4556694 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4556695 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4556696 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4556697 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4556698 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4556699 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees

4556738 im excited about this weekend as its sort of a home race for me as i live nearby
4556739 obviously im under a lot of pressure as im only fourth in the standings
4556740 ive made ground on the leaders especially after the last race
4556741 im on a bit of a high so that does wonders for the confidence
4556742 finishing ahead of my teammates definitely helps spa was a big one and i had a really good race and passed a lot of cars
4556743 i was really fast here at testing at the start of the year and im feeling really confident
4556744 we dont get much testing at silverstone an hour its all a bit primitive so we have to do a lot of work with the engineer first
4556745 so its all about getting the car as good as possible as quickly as possible
4556746 in my heart i think a woman has two choices either shes a feminist or a masochist
4556747 the evidence shows that your excessive consumption of alcohol was a contributing factor in the incident
4556748 it used to be that they were always blamed if they were wearing a short skirt today its that they were drinking
4556749 its very important for women whove been victims of rape to get compensation because often its the only acknowledgement you are going to get that you have been a victim of crime given that the conviction rate in this country is only 6
4556750 when i read the cica letter i just had no words i could not take it in it felt like i was being punished for having the audacity to step up and say i dont think this should have happened to me it was like going back to the 70s saying she was asking for it how else could you read the letter but as saying its my fault i was raped
4556751 dont blind drunk women who cry rape bear any responsibility for what happens

4556761 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4556762 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain

4556765 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4556766 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4556767 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4556768 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4556769 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4556770 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4556771 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4556772 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4556773 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4556774 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4556775 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4556776 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4556777 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4556778 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4556779 students use their computers for much more than just writing papers and research
4556780 its a way to stay connected with family and friends watch movies listen to music play games and more all these applications many of which will be used simultaneously generate a lot of demand for computing power so they need a lot of ram a substantial hard drive and the fastest processor available and they need to be mobile the device needs to be light small enough to fit in the classroom and able to run on battery power for several hours
4556781 sophisticated elegant design is the number one priority among students

4556783 it works well because you can always count on family we all have been there for each other we all treat each other well as employees but at the end of the day we try to come together and be family
4556784 its hard because hes still so young he doesnt really know who i am and couldnt care less about me he just wants shanon or his dad jarrod
4556785 im looking to get a tractor from a friend of mine but if he doesnt sell it ill get a john deere like the one my dad had when i was growing up its just a good way to keep your land up and i enjoy doing stuff like that
4556786 ive got a weed eater and a leaf blower too
4556787 the parts where you could see my face where all me but if it was the part where my legs are moving all crazy that was probably not me i had another guy the same size as me doing some of the dancing i really enjoyed the commercial but i wouldve picked a different firesuit
4556788 we have meetings in washington and i think its unique because i get to sit down with president bush and listen to his ideas about giving back to the communities and how we can get people to do more like the fans in nascar do
4556789 they like to hear ideas of how drivers like me and jeff gordon get people involved in volunteer work things we do at the tracks
4556790 kasey has a huge heart and i dont think people realize it
4556791 i didnt realize how big until i had this position and could see how many nice things he does for people he never wants credit or tells the family he just does it
4556792 i had never been there but it was great we definitely saw things that would offend the kids
4556793 i took a couple of friends from home and we rode bikes up to mount rushmore it was a great two day vacation the nightlife is outrageous the parties start late at night and go on well into the morning
4556794 lots of people think id rather stay in fancy hotels and whatnot when actually im the kind of guy that wouldnt care to stay in a tent with friends and a huge campfire

4556796 ross and ross accomplices fled the scene together while dj vlad lay on the ground bleeding profusely during which time one of his attackers stated yeah mother f r thats what you get

4556803 some rheumatologists who believe in complementary medicine prescriptions in conjunction with conventional medicine as an alternative treatment
4556804 they are not to prevent osteoarthritis or backward or to stop the damage caused by other kinds of arthritis
4556805 animal studies have shown that glucosamine has anti inflammatory properties this has not yet been tested in humans
4556806 that these substances help in natural pain relief for those suffering from osteoarthritis
4556807 se cree que both glucosamine and chondroitin are substances that can nourish the cartilage to prevent further breaking
4556808 the patient has to take at least two months before starting to see its benefits
4556809 they are regulated as food not as drugs or drugs
4556810 there is no regulation of quality or quantity in terms of their production
4556811 has been the case in which the product promises that each capsule contains 500 mg of glucosamine and then subject to verification it becomes apparent that their content is only 1 mg of this substance
4556812 the patient must understand that there is a likelihood that some work and others do not
4556813 has been found that can increase levels of blood sugar in diabetic patients
4556814 there is the likelihood that patients allergic to shellfish could suffer allergy glucosamine
4556815 we must bear in mind that as i mentioned these supplements are not regulated
4556816 therefore we must swallow after meals with a full stomach how to prevent such effects
4556817 these products although they are natural are not necessarily safe because some may have other side effects such as the liver toxicity for example
4556818 some may interact with other medications the patient is taking
4556819 every patient must understand that each case is unique commentary by your doctor will greatly help to make the right decision concerning his treatment
4556820 it is a degenerative disease of the joints that affects mainly the cartilage and bone that is underneath it
4556821 the cartilage is a gelatinous material that covers the bones and absorbs the tension produced by the physical movements of daily living walking running climbing stairs etc
4556822 if the patient has osteoarthritis this material will begin to break and wear their causes friction between bones pain swelling and loss of movement in the joint affected

4556827 its an embarrassment for canada its become very clear that we have a health minister and presumably a government behind him who are denialists its similar to the condemnation the south african government received for denying that hiv causes aids
4556828 i didnt have the sense that there was anyone else from other countries medical or government representatives speaking out against harm reduction the current canadian government is out of step with any rational response and out of step with the rest of the world
4556829 i think the world today is a different place and that its time for science and physics and
4556830 when someone says their heart needs lifting dont ask how come ask how high

4556833 after a year of studying various agreed statements that have come out of ecumenical dialogues between anglicans and roman catholics on the national and international level these episcopal clergy expressed an interest in having a dialogue on the local level and asked my permission to make an appointment to talk with bishop vann the stated goal of these official anglican roman catholic dialogues which have been going on for over 40 years has been full visible unity between the two communions
4556834 they have not claimed to act or speak nor have they been authorized to do so either on behalf of the episcopal diocese of fort worth or on my own behalf as their bishop
4556835 no bearing upon matters coming before our diocesan convention in november where a second vote will be taken on constitutional changes concerning our relationship with the general convention of the episcopal church
4556836 there is no proposal under consideration either publicly or privately for the episcopal diocese of fort worth to become part of the roman catholic church
4556837 after the november vote the episcopal diocese of fort worth intends to break away from the episcopal church in the us and enter under the jurisdiction of
4556838 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4556839 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
4556840 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice
4556841 we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that far moreso than bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights pro you know a number of other issues
4556842 at husky media we believe bigger is better and will never succumb to the shrink ray
4556843 weve been seeing it everywhere this summer from the size of a cup of yogurt to dog food to cheese wheels to staycations to 14 oz pints of beer isnt a pint supposed to be 16 oz this is one summer trend we will not let idly pass last i heard we live in america
4556844 at their most straightforward the artists are special not because they are somehow more gifted than the masters but because of their passionate disregard for convention their deep awareness of what it takes to be succeed and an unnatural compulsion to explore whatever lies beyond reach they are obsessed with the pursuit of their goal giving everything they have overcoming all obstacles and as they chase down theur visions of perfection we ourselves are rewarded with something measured not in degrees points or awestruck gasps but in soul they are individuals and they are often misunderstood while others may follow them recording and commenting on their every move they remain solitary driven figures undeterred by the subjective opinions and surface assessments of others cutting words from those who cannot yet see the beauty the soul while the artists carve new shapes and textures on the face of the world not everyone respects or understands them they dont know what it takes or even what it is undeterred the artists keep going further in every respect cutting through the dark and fearlessly lighting the way for the rest they change the way thing are and as they do they change us so what is the essential difference what name shall we give to sheer defiance it is artistry
4556845 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4556846 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4556847 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4556848 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4556849 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4556850 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4556851 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4556852 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4556853 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4556854 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4556855 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4556856 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4556857 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4556858 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4556859 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4556860 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4556861 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4556862 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4556863 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4556864 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4556865 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4556866 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4556867 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4556868 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4556869 who are open to doing something on the production side
4556870 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4556871 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4556872 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4556873 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4556874 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4556875 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4556876 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4556877 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4556878 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4556879 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4556880 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4556881 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4556882 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4556883 my husband and i are curius but i had a couple of questions
4556884 none that cant be managed just generally practice safe sex and youll be fine
4556885 just be careful take it slow and it should be alright
4556886 what about pregnancy is it possible that i could get pregnant through anal sex
4556887 at first i thought it was funny and flattering but its tiresome now ive seen magazines where are saying if you want a butt like this it has to be fake and im just like dude have you ever seen an armenian girl before i love that im curvy but im on this major kick to try and lose weight especially in my butt im just so over it when youre posing on the red carpet and the paparazzi shout turn around turn around it gets a little offensive
4556888 at the end of that first summer i sat back and enjoyed the payoff a few good blooms a blossoming friendship and the beginning of a new education the next spring karen and i sat down and planned out a whole new perennial garden by my back patio

4556890 theres some controversy now as to whether nbc which broadcast the ceremony 12 hours after it happened properly informed viewers that they were not in fact watching real fireworks in what was one of the most highly rated programs of the year
4556891 revelations about cgi fireworks even if they were real on the ground may lead viewers to be less impressed
4556892 theres some controversy now as to whether nbc which broadcast the ceremony 12 hours after it happened properly informed viewers that they were not in fact watching real fireworks

4556906 we are excited to be part of this initiative and look forward to an exciting relationship which will ultimately help save lives
4556907 since the gift of flowers has special meaning to those sending and receiving them we wanted our best selling arrangements to be even more meaningful knowing that together we are battling a disease that affects so many

4556925 never ever will succumb my small nation of georgia it is an unprovoked attack to kill georgian democracy and together we will repel it
4556926 talk to the villagers these invaders are 21st century barbarians you are dealing with people who despise everything human everything nice everything modern and everything european
4556927 unfortunately today we are looking evil in the eye it is very strong very nasty and very dangerous
4556928 its important to know you had an ancestor who was out there
4556929 it personalizes it and brings it home and makes you ask yourself some of the important questions what would i have done if my ancestors did that am i capable of doing this we need to realize how something like this can come about
4556930 no holds barred let the chips fall as they may
4556931 our feeling was we just had to face it head on let people deal with the truth and not with mythology
4556932 i know its very uncomfortable and ive gotten a lot of hate mail people have said why peel off the scab its because the wound is not healing it needs major surgery
4556933 no easy absolution for the perpetrators is possible the best that could be argued was that during a time of uncertainty and possible war some of the mormons like other men and women throughout history did not match their behavior with their ideals
4556934 from the churchs point of view the book doesnt try to justify the motives of the people who did the killing
4556935 its always been the tendency in the past to say it was a drastic action but consider all theyve been through this book doesnt do that there is nothing this party did or didnt do to justify the treatment they received in that sense its an advance
4556936 who happened to be involved in something that went wrong
4556937 people should be mature enough not to get angry over history like this especially when it is being presented in a non biased way
4556938 if this is used as a weapon itd be different
4556939 i wish they would have been more christ like and had a little more faith in the lord but they did chose what they did and the lord will be the judge its our place to forgive
4556940 now that 150 years have gone by we ought to be able to look at this and simply accept it
4556941 i look at it and im horrified by it but i dont perceive it as some sort of stain on me or my family
4556942 if they made a mistake fine theyll pay for it one way or another
4556943 we cannot comprehend the situations they were in the pressures they were under i do feel sorry for the ones who were killed but there is nothing we can do about it now we ought to let the whole thing rest
4556944 we so prize the sterling character and great pioneering heritage we have and i dont want to muckrake that

4556952 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4556953 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

4556956 then i so hated moslems i could kill them at any flimsy excuse but now i love them with a passion as my brothers
4556957 i lived in hate and it almost consumed me i now use an artificial limb as a result of the crises in kaduna in 1992 which was an offshoot of the zango kataf crisis when i led some militias on a reprisal attack in tundun wada
4556958 but i thank god that today i work to stop people from violence from shedding blood on account of religious di being incapacitated as i am and i am glad that many more people are being transformed
4556959 religious crises are often caused by people getting so overemotional about their religion that they fail to reason what their spiritual models would have done in such circumstances
4556960 the frequency of religious crisis in the north had made many christians to develop hatred for moslems thereby negating the love of christ
4556961 despite our differences we can co exist we are one people
4556962 the centre tries to bring to the fore the process of resolution and mediation as preventive tools in managing crisis and conflict in the state
4556963 since the society was not static but susceptible to changes violence conflict and crime are also prone to changes thus creating the need to use the available peace options to solve the problem
4556964 we think that if we can get it right in mushin then we can use the model to get other parts of the state
4556965 there is now growing mutual trust among the parties involved as understanding is bringing yet more understanding and culture meeting culture through a cross fertilisation of ideas
4556966 we cannot be campaigning for a mega city status when there is no peace understanding and peaceful co existence among different religions in the state
4556967 we are moving to collaborate with government to transform the area boys to become tools for achieving peaceful co existence between religions
4556968 we are trying to transform them to be better area boys so that they can be responsible

4557203 it could be legislation in the states it could be the number of baby friendly hospitals or the number of lactation support experts in the state

4557205 in states that had multiple pieces of legislation 76 of children were breastfed after birth compared with only 64 who lived in states with no legislation

4557208 this identification by aim and others hasnt been disputed by the media which has desperately tried to ignore the obama davis relationship but the obama campaign has not responded to it until now

4557218 and it was a very important and serious thing that involved national interests and an order from a state leader from the politburo

4557223 she is a good child kind hearted cute friendly and low profile with a very calm heart she loves performing peking opera and has participated in shows on international volunteers day
4557224 its harmful to both girls and it is discomforting to know that a girl was instructed to mime while the other had no chance to show her face due to an allegedly unattractive appearance

4557233 when i stood up against brian last year and sang highway to hell it was an amazing experience i was petrified but the nice thing was people in the audience knew us and it was a heartwarming experience after the gig cliff came up and said it was fantastic

4557288 people end up living under bridges or in cars we would prefer they have a roof over their heads
4557289 for people to say this isnt a priority because its based on the possibility of harm is just wrong
4557290 for the most part these people have done their time
4557291 were better off educating students and preparing them to take accountability for their own public security
4557292 i think its just a knee jerk reaction to a problem that doesnt exist its going to make things 10 times worse

4557322 the average age of a sewer system in canada is about 60 to 65 years and the useful life of that type of system is about 75 years
4557323 this has reversed in the last few years and the bulk of losses are now water related losses primarily sewer backup
4557324 theres no question that were paying out lots of dollars on water related claims
4557325 in areas where we do charge higher premiums for the sewer backup endorsement we also provide discounts to the client that takes some of those mitigating steps
4557326 if water damage continues to increase both in frequency and severity as is the current trend our industry may be in for a flood of resentment
4557327 government agencies should pause and reflect on the significance of this verdict

4557340 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4557341 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia

4557360 theres really no ill will between myself and the 49ers weve moved forward theyve moved forward and theyre trying to figure out what they want to do on offense and thankfully the packers have put their trust in me as far as quarterback goes
4557361 i wouldnt trade with him because i love the situation that im in
4557362 obviously it would have been fun to play but theres so many advantages to waiting like i did and obviously the situation i was in being behind brett and being able to acquire all the knowledge that i could from him and at the same time come along at kind of my own pace without a lot of pressure on me i think it was definitely an advantage
4557363 ive just got to worry about myself and the reps im going to get going in there and making the most of them

4557365 the ball can come out so fast on one play and on another play its a different look its a seven step drop then you go down the field so just getting used to that and being ready for anything
4557366 weve talked about it a number of times two or three times
4557367 but like i told him just the fact that he was in the conversation for the no 1 pick in the draft i think it speaks volumes now why it happened and why the 49ers went in another direction thats a different story but he was one of three guys who were going to be chosen for that pick
4557368 aaron and i have always gotten along well when weve been around each other especially through the draft stuff and all of that going on he was always good to me so ive always respected him for that and i respect him as a player

4557398 contrary to what youve just seen war is neither glamorous nor fun
4557399 i suspected something when i found the first bird in gabon since it didnt exactly match any of the species descriptions in the field guides
4557400 once i was able to compare them side by side to other specimens in our collections it was clear that these birds were special
4557401 companies like hostess and nestle are perpetuating rainforest destruction and human rights abuses by using palm oil in their products
4557402 our goal is to educate consumers and work with companies who use palm oil in their products to stop destroying rainforests if americans knew the extent to which their food and common household items were contributing to rainforest destruction theyd probably think twice before buying them
4557403 i suspected something when i found the first bird in gabon since it didnt exactly match any of the species descriptions in the field guides
4557404 once i was able to compare them side by side to other specimens in our collections it was clear that these birds were special you of course have to be cautious but i was still very excited at the prospect of possibly having found a new species of bird
4557405 finding the olive backed forest robin strongly underscores the importance of our research this helps us show the conservation importance of the area
4557406 although finding an unknown species like the olive backed forest robin was not the goal of the mab project
4557407 it is definitely a reminder that the world still holds surprises for us

4557412 from chun li thanks for being there through a difficult time

4557414 la legitimidad y normalidad del acto plebiscitario reafirma la consolidaci n del proceso democr tico boliviano y la solidez de sus instituciones
4557415 la argentina depende fundamentalmente del campo y de lo que sucede en el campo
4557416 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4557417 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4557418 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4557419 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
4557420 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
4557421 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
4557422 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
4557423 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4557424 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4557425 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4557426 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4557427 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4557428 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos

4557438 how do you ask me to accept a lawyer when we have so many contradictions
4557439 you are the judge and i am the accused at the same time you are my enemy
4557440 to proceed without al bahlul mounting a defense would destroy any possibility of having an appearance of legitimacy and fairness
4557441 it is to walthamstow what the eiffel tower is to paris its absolutely unique the heart of the community
4557442 i always remember my time working at walthamstow dogs it was my first ever job and i was so happy to be getting a wage for the first time
4557443 it has been very popular in the last month or so but thats because of the closure
4557444 but we lost half a million pounds 900 000 last year the directors decided they just couldnt keep it going
4557445 its been a tough time for businesses theyve not had a great time of it
4557446 a military mastermind who takes part in hatching a plot to wipe out nazi leaders
4557447 we had not only been looking for a solution to solve the visual problem of the studio but also the technical problems to do with dimming and maintenance and the changing of the lights the purpose was to save energy and money by using a new technology and with the parlite leds we have certainly made a huge improvement to the efficiency
4557448 we chose coemar because we could guarantee functionality and power output and also we knew they would provide the support and since leds draw less power we were able to use more use more fixtures to create additional flexibility this is a multi set studio and we generally run the parlite leds at between 60 70
4557449 we supported this important project because it represents the future
4557450 when a company like mediaset chooses coemar it further underlines not only the strength of our r amp d programme but that leading studio dps as well as entertainment and architectural lds are now endorsing our products
4557451 we are pleased to have been able to set a new standard in lighting and we are entirely satisfied that we have found the best solution
4557452 we are proud that not only are we the first organisation to take this approach but at the same time we have confounded some of the sceptics
4557453 this is sad for europe sad for all in this densely populated continent
4557454 the agreements content and the haste with which the two sides reached it allow the conclusion that the project is actually aimed against russia
4557455 by putting up interceptors poland is placing itself at risk in terms of priority such targets are the first to be destroyed
4557456 to a real increase in tension in russian american relations
4557457 i can only say that russia hasnt called off the visit and we still count that it will come to pass
4557458 lavrov will surely be eagerly greeted here and there are many subjects which we can and even should talk about with the russian federation
4557459 we want russia to be able to have the possibility if it so desires to inspect the future base
4557460 we are glad that poland and the us made this agreement which is also good for the czech republic and nato
4557461 we knew it was going to be tough playing china at their home all we wanted was to fight we wanted to play hard each game and each set and we did
4557462 i told them to not think about the result but to believe in yourself and fight for every point
4557463 our players are very emotional very passionate but sometimes too much
4557464 i have to balance it if it gets too high i have to settle it or if too low i have to raise it sort of like a cheerleader
4557465 something went wrong with her condition with li juan in the fourth set and she became emotional which affected our game
4557466 china is a great team and has had great results from all the recent tournaments
4557467 it doesnt mean you win one game and youre better than china
4557468 wyzant has been a fantastic site for me personally i am contacted only for students in my neighborhood as close as a block away all emails are screened for scams so i never have to worry and my jobs can be done professionaly because the site takes care of all the logistical and financial matters it has been nothing but a pleasure for me to work with this site
4557469 the dollar is on fire again so thats causing people to re evaluate everything
4557470 it means oil prices could fall dramatically we could see prices get to double digits if this continues
4557471 theyre basically saying we could have an oil glut because demand is slowing
4557472 its obvious that high prices do slow down demand and the market works
4557473 its amazing that all those people came out and helped
4557474 i ran out of my house to join 10 people trying to lift up the bus at first we couldnt get it up so then another 10 people ran over to help and we got the bus up and the lady out
4557475 i hope that as this child grows up he comes to understand that his mother gave her life in service to our city and we are forever grateful
4557476 wyzant has been a fantastic site for me personally i am contacted only for students in my neighborhood as close as a block away all emails are screened for scams so i never have to worry and my jobs can be done professionaly because the site takes care of all the logistical and financial matters it has been nothing but a pleasure for me to work with this site
4557477 an educated person is one who has learned that information almost always turns out to be at best incomplete and very often false misleading fictitious mendacious just dead wrong
4557478 the number of artists that he was involved with and helped significantly or just made great records with the list is almost unbelievable
4557479 he loved black music r amp b music and rhythm and blues was his foundation he had a feeling for it he had the knack to keep it going in his heart and recognize the talent that he felt was real
4557480 jerry wexler didnt change the sound of america he put the sound to the public he open the doors and windows to the radio stations and made everybody listen
4557481 no one really knew how to make a record when i started
4557482 you simply went into the studio turned on the mike and said play
4557483 huffington post chicago would ultimately be shooting itself in the foot if the chicago tribune disappeared so would half of the actual news the huffington post now highlights
4557484 i think its important for us to just celebrate the fact that sen obama is an outstanding fabulous family man i really wanna stand from the highest rooftop and say hes a wonderful husband and a great dad his daughters adore him and in times like these when the institution of marriage is obviously under attack for us to have a person running for the highest office in the land who has such a sterling reputation as a family man i think this speaks volumes
4557485 you can determine a lot about a persons character by how he or she treats his family
4557486 and im glad that sen obama is running for president i think he would be a fabulous president he has stood by families i think hell stand by families here in this country and thats a great thing
4557487 well i dont know a lot about john mccains family history i do know that however as recently as last week i think it was the senator made a comment in south dakota regarding his wife entering some buffalo chips contest which is a topless deal if she were to enter she would probably win it and my personal opinion and based on my understanding of the christian faith thats not n o t the type of expression that a presidential candidate or anyone for that matter who espouses the christian faith ought to make so i dont know if thats perfect case in point but it sure does help to juxtapose the dna of sen obama if you would versus the dna of sen mccain
4557488 i would just add that our intent with this ad is to be a positive a positive bio piece on sen obama sort of recognizing that many are still trying to better understand his background
4557489 many in the christian community have not forgotten you know what happened with sen mccain you know marrying his second wife one month after leaving his second wife you know after a disfiguring car accident
4557490 extremely effective because it highlights one of obamas strengths and that is his family the republican party wants to demonize the guy as a crazy liberal a la john kerry but the problem is that unlike kerry obama has the straight laced family narrative you couldnt run a syrupy gushy pro family ad like this with kerry because he didnt have the cute little kids and he was on his second marriage
4557491 the main reason for it is to assist in the investigation of crime
4557492 each local council can make a decision for themselves on what is the most interest to them
4557493 the history here is something remarkable i had surgery the last time i was supposed to dance here and al was nice enough to rebook me back at the club
4557494 the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the 21st century
4557495 por un mundo sano convocada por la conferencia de religiosos y religiosas conferre de la di cesis de copiap
4557496 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
4557497 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
4557498 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
4557499 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
4557500 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
4557501 la historia dice que barrick ayud y respet cada pulgada de los cr menes en toronto el 7 de mayo de 2008 cuando me encontr con los ejecutivos de barrick qued confiado en que la gerencia har todo lo posible para suprimir las matanzas en el sitio de la mina de porgera hab amos convenido en iniciar un di logo pero a n antes de comenzar las matanzas y las muertes que ocurren en el sitio de la mina est n aumentando
4557502 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
4557503 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
4557504 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
4557505 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
4557506 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables
4557507 cuando fui militar dirig un grupo donde el 80 y 90 eran de origen mapuche y que ten a las mejores relaciones con ellos y record que adem s en la cabecera de su escritorio ten a un retrato de lautaro
4557508 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
4557509 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
4557510 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
4557511 urgente necesidad de respetar y promover los derechos intr nsecos de los pueblos ind genas que derivan de sus estructuras pol ticas econ micas y sociales y de sus culturas de sus tradiciones espirituales de su historia y de su concepci n de la vida especialmente los derechos a sus tierras territorios y recursos
4557512 celebrar n consultas y cooperar n de buena fe con los pueblos ind genas interesados por conducto de sus propias instituciones representativas a fin de obtener su consentimiento libre e informado antes de aprobar cualquier proyecto que afecte a sus tierras o territorios y otros recursos particularmente en relaci n con el desarrollo la utilizaci n o la explotaci n de recursos minerales h dricos o de otro tipo
4557513 the us has for several years now mishandled the situation in georgia
4557514 the way that mikheil saakashvili has approached this has been by thinking that he could be an extension of the west a partner of the united states
4557515 in many ways we have given him cause for thinking that with the many visits to the united states the talk of georgia as a beacon for democracy
4557516 i think in many respects saakashvili got too close to the united states and the united states got too close to saakashvili
4557517 it made him overreach it made him feel at the end of the day that the west would come to his assistance if he got into trouble
4557518 underlying all this is a larger more significant contest a geopolitical struggle between russia and the west over the export of caspian sea oil and natural gas
4557519 the united states seeks to use georgia as an energy corridor to transport caspian energy to the west without going through iran or russia to this end it helped build the btc pipeline across georgia and helped beef up the georgian military to protect it
4557520 by declaring the caucasus a region that is thousands of miles from the american continent a sphere of its national interest the united states made a serious blunder
4557521 the kremlin made abundantly clear that it would view kosovos independence without serbian consent and a un security council mandate as a precedent for the two georgian de facto independent enclaves
4557522 furthermore while president saakashvili was making obvious his ambition to reconquer abkhazia and south ossetia moscow was both publicly and privately warning that georgias use of force to re establish control of the two regions would meet a tough russian reaction including if needed air strikes against georgia proper
4557523 localization for ikeadm seems more straightforward when complete phrases are translated rather than a part of a phrase a call to dump foo and more of the phrase it could also accommodate non english grammar more easily
4557524 probably just me but i hope they get hold of the ones who run the site and make them walk the plank
4557525 iso and iec gave ooxml the greenlight after organization leaders
4557526 fine we will let you have your feature in the standard if our technology is part of the standard too then well vote for your proposition and you vote for our proposition tomorrow
4557527 the right most valued by all civilized men is the right to be left alone
4557528 as a result our bodies and brains feel less difference between day and night
4557529 people are sleeping in front of the tv or nodding off during conversations and taking long afternoon naps this leads to less sleep at night in a way their sleep habits become more like babies and less like those of healthy adults who sleep in consolidated periods during the night
4557530 improves sleep and daytime vigilance helping to re organize the circadian system the bodys internal clock
4557531 when youre in an airplane you dont want your fuel to start solidifying
4557532 so we have a bit of a chicken and egg problem
4557533 were looking for something that is so correct in its performance that it can be interchanged with petroleum based kerosene
4557534 from a distribution standpoint from a technical standpoint it needs to fit without modifications or special handling
4557535 it can be grown anywhere you can have a pool of water and expose it to sunlight
4557536 if anyone is below 50 a gallon id be stunned
4557537 we have a pretty good idea on how to grow algae the biggest challenge is in the harvesting and how to extract it from the water
4557538 you arent going to find a fuel thats pennies on the dollar than what we find today
4557539 even if we were to double the volume we were to make in biofuels every year for the next 10 years were still looking at maybe this will impact 15 percent of the overall fuel supply
4557540 realistically for anything to be happening at scale enough to actually impact an airlines bottom line were years away
4557541 russian forces need to leave georgia at once this is no longer 1968
4557542 not only those people who perpetrated this but those who failed to stop it
4557543 the deployment of new anti missile forces has as its aim the russian federation
4557544 therefore any fairy tales about deterring other states fairy tales that with the help of this system we will deter some sort of rogue states no longer work
4557545 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4557546 we very much want the six point plan to be implemented very promptly so that russian troops are no longer in georgia outside abkhazia and south ossetia
4557547 whats the most disgusting thing youve had in your mouth
4557548 i think theyre pretty close to being ready to go
4557549 we toyed with the idea of getting them out there a little bit here but decided to wait i think well get some of the guys back next week
4557550 a nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master and deserves one
4557551 my daughter whos a doctor in salt lake city she captained one of the fantasy teams and then was thrown out of the league because of inside information but i will say she was clean
4557552 she did not phone me about it and she was very upset about it but she knows football as all my girls do
4557553 a nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master and deserves one
4557554 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
4557555 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4557556 i think the russian behavior over the last several days is generally concerning not only to the united states but to all of our european allies
4557557 unfortunately today we are looking evil in the eye it is very strong very nasty and very dangerous
4557558 never ever will succumb my small nation of georgia it is an unprovoked attack to kill georgian democracy and together we will repel it
4557559 talk to the villagers these invaders are 21st century barbarians you are dealing with people who despise everything human everything nice everything modern and everything european
4557560 the first thing that ought to be noted is that romney is the most intellectually inconsistent politician
4557561 it was so thick we couldnt see out the windows hundreds of butterflies dying it was sad the van was covered in yellow and black wings i was able to save one butterfly at the car wash before the hose was turned on
4557562 wyzant has been a fantastic site for me personally i am contacted only for students in my neighborhood as close as a block away all emails are screened for scams so i never have to worry and my jobs can be done professionaly because the site takes care of all the logistical and financial matters it has been nothing but a pleasure for me to work with this site

4557564 canada will now embark on its own journey on the search for these two vessels which has the allure of an indiana jones mystery
4557565 if we cant even pronounce beijing correctly and consistently how can we ever hope to address deeper cross cultural misunderstandings and conflicts
4557566 heres a woman thats successful takes care of herself looks amazing and she took the steps to get there it doesnt happen unless you take charge shes a great role model for many many women
4557567 when i was in my 30s 50 just seemed so ancient to me
4557568 i was in high school when she hit it big
4557569 now that her first young fans are in their 30s we look at madonna as sort of a harbinger of the future for us and the future looks pretty good
4557570 is that aging is not the inevitability that we might have assumed by watching our fathers now in their 50s and 60s madonna is proof that exercising and eating right at an early age pays off
4557571 i want to know who her doctor is its really hard to believe shes 50 she looks 40 and she just keeps going at it living life and loving life
4557572 put a picture of a 50 year old woman today next to one from my mothers generation
4557573 we look at least 10 to 15 years younger than they did
4557574 also 50 really is a new beginning for so many women
4557575 many have accomplished a number of their goals already their children are getting older for the first time they can really think about themselves and ask what do i want from life
4557576 as the cliche goes i guess its better than the alternative
4557577 i just dont feel like what 50 should feel like
4557578 i remember my grandmother at 50 her hair was completely white my mother too was just at a very different place in her life than i am now
4557579 shes done a remarkable job of marketing herself and shes always been able to reinvent herself
4557580 i have to teach people what i know worked for me im responsible but what they poured into me how they blessed my life the older generation now that im a part of the older generation its my responsibility to pour into the generation thats come after me
4557581 its about saving our youth a lot of our youth dont understand their value they just accept the lies that the enemy has told them about their worth about what they can accomplish and about what they should settle for
4557582 im fired up about firing up young people to understand their power and their worth
4557583 i love singing with bebe we have a great time on stage in the studio we have a great time we do what we do and so its not something thats weird i think im more at home with that than even by myself
4557584 always sisters becoming the princess you were created to be
4557585 i could do these girls conferences full time because its just life changing when you take out time and you see those faces and you see the encouragement and you get them to realize who they are and whose they are its just nothing else compared to that to me
4557586 whenever i tell people what im doing theres always that look the furrowed brow and then the im sorry
4557587 most people are like if its under your sink for a week you dont want it there
4557588 ive never heard of anyone wanting to save that stuff
4557589 if i had totally thought it through i might not have done it
4557590 i never feel like i was being preached to with dave its like learn by example
4557591 the number of artists that he was involved with and helped significantly or just made great records with the list is almost unbelievable
4557592 he loved black music r amp b music and rhythm and blues was his foundation he had a feeling for it he had the knack to keep it going in his heart and recognize the talent that he felt was real
4557593 jerry wexler didnt change the sound of america he put the sound to the public he open the doors and windows to the radio stations and made everybody listen
4557594 no one really knew how to make a record when i started
4557595 you simply went into the studio turned on the mike and said play
4557596 in the early sessions i just sat there watching ertegun while i was cowering in fright
4557597 but as time went on we proved to be a very successful team we went on the road together we hung out together
4557598 wrote many of the songs in the early days and he drew upon his knowledge of jazz and the blues because songs always have to have a source this is not to say that there is not great originality
4557599 when it came to the studio you could say the two of us were joined at the hip
4557600 among my favorite sessions i feel the things we did together were dynamite
4557601 ive spoken all week about how much ive enjoyed the olympic experience how much i love the spirit of it
4557602 thats a disappointing way to exit the tournament when you not only lose the match but you lose a little faith in your fellow competitor
4557603 playing in the olympics in whats supposed to be considered a gentlemans sport thats a time to call it on yourself
4557604 fernando looked me square in the eye and didnt call it
4557605 i mean its just one point there is an umpire if im 100 percent sure about it i mean i will give it but im not sure
4557606 whatever is going to get him to have some sleep tonight then thats fine
4557607 it was really one or two points and who played those one or two points better
4557608 im happy because the worst thing that can happen is im going to have all the medals
4557609 daniela was part of the worlds elite in the last eight years shes been tested constantly and all her samples so far were negative
4557610 i feel sorry that its happening with an athlete who is a model for giving everything possible during training and competitions
4557611 nahoana moa isika no manameloka ny ataoni rosia nefa manadino kosa ny fanamelohana ny politika aimperialistani etazonia izay mody mampiasa ny fitolomana ho aminny fahafahana sy ny demaokirasia nefa ahafahana mametraka antoka ho fiarovana ny tombotsoany manokana
4557612 but when you find out who did it let us know were always looking for ideas
4557613 its nice that someone by placing a sticker on an object can make it a piece of art
4557614 this particular piece of guerrilla art seems to have accomplished this lofty goal brilliantly
4557615 but i will tell you i think this is a smart and fun piece of public art
4557616 seguiremos trabajando duro e investigando a lo interno de la instituci n para poder descubrir a tiempo y separar de las filas a todo el que intente marchar el buen nombre de la marina de guerra
4557617 estos actos deplorables manchan el uniforme de las fuerzas armadas y traicionan el juramento que ellos hicieron al ingresar de respetar la constituci n y las leyes
4557618 unfortunately today we are looking evil in the eye it is very strong very nasty and very dangerous
4557619 never ever will succumb my small nation of georgia it is an unprovoked attack to kill georgian democracy and together we will repel it
4557620 talk to the villagers these invaders are 21st century barbarians you are dealing with people who despise everything human everything nice everything modern and everything european

4557624 there are huge economies of scale in going larger in any solar system or any power plant
4557625 its a big deal to see pv making it at the central station utility scale level we dont need a major breakthrough were able to compete against other technologies within a two year time frame

4557629 any project like this that we can help bring in to northeast tennessee is a very good thing for the entire region
4557630 i appreciate the excellent work of the members of the state building commission i have enjoyed working with them on this and other projects and look forward to doing so in the future
4557631 i think we both know what we expect good shoes would help what and you might wanna dip that bandanna in some vinegar
4557632 the right to a fair and public trial is a bedrock principle of democracy
4557633 unfortunately in this regard members of the armed services have fewer rights than those granted to criminal defendants in civilian courts we believe that at a minimum the armed services should create an easily accessible docket of information listing those charged details regarding the charges against them and the date and time of their trials and pre trials
4557634 deedees had an accident not serious shes still recuperating shell come to see you when shes out of hospital no need for you to trail all the way over to see her just send a card

4557636 thank you thats an inspired suggestion i didnt know you could talk
4557637 most of the time i dont feel its worth the effort of forcing the air out of my lungs too much bother id stop breathing if i could
4557638 poets often top themselves quite disproportionately i put it down to the metrical form
4557639 it underlines the utter meaninglessness of it all you have pattern regularity a semblance of sense but its just sound and syllables the sound of sense thats what robert frost said but he meant something different
4557640 no youre thinking of robert lowell under the mountain no under the volcano the magic mountain s somebody else youll excuse me i have to go back to sleep now
4557641 i was thinking about your tits you have nice tits
4557642 dont look like that i said they were nice i imagine your nipples are big and soft like plums
4557643 i told you most of the time i cant be bothered holding a conversation too much work doesnt mean my minds stopped working
4557644 its a miracle should i call the staff to tell them about your recovery do you really like them
4557645 dont look like that im not about to top myself
4557646 have you ever been shaved down there its very exciting
4557647 you have to lie very still a best first of all we have a discussion what do you want completely shaved or a design
4557648 a heart is good a good strong design an excellent first choice
4557649 oh yes i think so your nipples are standing out like ripe plums i squeeze them like a greedy shopper
4557650 you relax my hands are gentle but firm i am in control you are becoming excited you push my hands down between your legs you beg me to shave you i am not sure you are ready i need to explore i slip my fingers between your lips you are very wet
4557651 my fingers glide over your very wet cunt i part the hair your clitoris is standing out i run my thumb over it to smooth it dont want any accidents
4557652 i think youre ready i lather you up your bush is very springy and makes lots of foam

4557654 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4557655 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4557656 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4557657 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4557658 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4557659 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4557660 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4557661 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4557662 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4557663 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4557664 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4557665 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4557666 what does all this have to do with a university
4557667 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4557668 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4557669 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4557670 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4557671 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4557672 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4557673 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba

4557677 the democrats in their zeal to raise taxes on cigarettes have driven lord knows how much commerce across the boarder

4557679 miracle treat day is a source of great pride for the dairy queen system

4557681 it would ban the sale to minors but it doesnt ban the use by minors
4557682 it is not that uncommon to have restrictions on what kids can purchase
4557683 we are honored to return as the official candy sponsor to the 2008 jcc maccabi games
4557684 the games represent an important event drawing young athletes from all over the world for our peanut chews hot tamales and mike and ike candy brands to be able to sweeten these kids memories of participating is quite special to us
4557685 it began and ended in 2006 and my family knew all about it
4557686 thank you for your awesome posts deceiver is by far the best new blog i discovered this year
4557687 thank you for having the balls to cut through the spin and hype
4557688 oh my god can i come and work for you people
4557689 it is nice to get intellectual about something that really has no bearing on anyones life
4557690 another blog filled with the angry ramblings of the jealous and envious
4557691 interesting that most of the hypocrisy comes from popular and attractive women
4557692 love your site btw im so through with all that nasty perez like gossip based on nothing
4557693 how did i ever live without the keen insights and cutting observations of deceiver
4557694 refute the charge that hes an empty suit full of empty rhetoric
4557695 if one voter out of 10 000 does that id be surprised
4557696 hes for billions in new oil company giveaways while gas prices soar
4557697 now its how reliable and credible is the reference there are ways to manipulate that
4557698 his attacks on obama not true msnbc 7 28 08 false factcheck org 7 28 08 baloney
4557699 he made time to go to the gym but canceled a visit with wounded troops
4557700 i saw that and said factcheck should fact check that
4557701 but thats what it is a tactic for us skeptics it doesnt mean much anyone who gets their facts from political ads gets what they deserve
4557702 baloney according to media outlets an obama campaign ad says

4557714 i had an email from phil hes not home yet but he emailed me from work
4557715 oh good im sorry i slept through everything i took some pills
4557716 probably the best thing i never thought of looking through my emails till just now silly really
4557717 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4557718 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4557719 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4557720 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4557721 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4557722 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4557723 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4557724 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4557725 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4557726 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4557727 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4557728 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4557729 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4557730 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4557731 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4557732 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4557733 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4557734 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4557735 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4557736 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4557737 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4557738 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4557739 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4557740 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4557741 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4557742 it was very frightening at first and it got even more frightening when you saw the others mr dyer said
4557743 theres a lot of comment being made that it looks fake or it looks like a suit
4557744 but these people wasnt there when i was sweating pulling this thing through the woods
4557745 ive had interactions with tom biscardi in the past and based on that history i would say that anything he is involved in is suspect
4557746 the fact that the two georgian men turned to him and not anyone with scientific credentials is very questionable
4557747 we are sad to hear that our important mckees rocks institution is leaving so we decided to get some doughnuts and pastries for the whole office
4557748 weve been here for 40 years and we just love the bakery
4557749 its going to be tough on all these employees here
4557750 we talk about how theres only one president at a time so the idea that you would send your own emissaries and really interfere with the process is remarkable
4557751 its very risky and can send mixed messages to foreign governments they accused obama of being presumptuous but he didnt do anything close to this
4557752 climate change also seems to be affecting the pied flycatcher an archetypal bird of welsh oak woodlands they appear to be breeding earlier across a number of sites and the worry is they may eventually breed so early they are out of sync with their major food source of caterpillars
4557753 the race between mccain and obama has been so zealous and the coverage so intense fathead just had to throw ourselves into the fray
4557754 our fathead nation is so passionate about sports and entertainment we just knew they would want one of the presidential candidate images we pledge a fathead in every home
4557755 pur essendo espressione di una coalizione ha detto tra laltro fin dal momento in cui mi sono insediato e a maggior ragione adesso che ho giurato davanti al consiglio mi considero sindaco di tutti i catanesi al di l di appartenenze e schieramenti so che il compito che attende la giunta e il sindaco gravoso ma sono certo che con la collaborazione di maggioranza e opposizione nel rispetto dei ruoli e nel rispetto assoluto degli obiettivi da raggiungere potremo affrontare i problemi che assillano catania
4557756 a causa di una crisi finanziaria e didentit un delicato momento
4557757 dalla voglia di ricominciare che nel codice genetico dei catanesi
4557758 my name is miss michelle and if i were an animal id be a whale
4557759 no hemos de tolerar que no se nos deje saber aquello que podemos y debemos saber
4557760 if you cannot change the people around you change the people around you
4557761 if i win this i will probably rethink and play in the netherlands next week and try to qualify
4557762 its farfetched to think that ill get a wild card
4557763 the ryder cup would be lovely and i would be an idiot if i said it does not matter but more important is enjoying my golf again
4557764 its never fun to miss the cut especially not at home
4557765 its fortunate that we dont play here all year around
4557766 it is to walthamstow what the eiffel tower is to paris its absolutely unique the heart of the community
4557767 i always remember my time working at walthamstow dogs it was my first ever job and i was so happy to be getting a wage for the first time
4557768 it has been very popular in the last month or so but thats because of the closure
4557769 but we lost half a million pounds 900 000 last year the directors decided they just couldnt keep it going
4557770 its been a tough time for businesses theyve not had a great time of it
4557771 they chose in 2005 to go a direction and the packers chose me
4557772 theres really no ill will between myself and the 49ers weve moved forward theyve moved forward and theyre trying to figure out what they want to do on offense and thankfully the packers have put their trust in me as far as quarterback goes
4557773 i wouldnt trade with him because i love the situation that im in
4557774 obviously it would have been fun to play but theres so many advantages to waiting like i did and obviously the situation i was in being behind brett and being able to acquire all the knowledge that i could from him and at the same time come along at kind of my own pace without a lot of pressure on me i think it was definitely an advantage
4557775 ive just got to worry about myself and the reps im going to get going in there and making the most of them
4557776 any given play it seems like there are so many possibilities that is unique to this system
4557777 the ball can come out so fast on one play and on another play its a different look its a seven step drop then you go down the field so just getting used to that and being ready for anything
4557778 weve talked about it a number of times two or three times
4557779 but like i told him just the fact that he was in the conversation for the no 1 pick in the draft i think it speaks volumes now why it happened and why the 49ers went in another direction thats a different story but he was one of three guys who were going to be chosen for that pick
4557780 aaron and i have always gotten along well when weve been around each other especially through the draft stuff and all of that going on he was always good to me so ive always respected him for that and i respect him as a player
4557781 i think theyre pretty close to being ready to go
4557782 we toyed with the idea of getting them out there a little bit here but decided to wait i think well get some of the guys back next week
4557783 if we cant even pronounce beijing correctly and consistently how can we ever hope to address deeper cross cultural misunderstandings and conflicts
4557784 we looked around and then we see jim and his wife over at another table with washington quarterback jason campbell and his girlfriend and you can tell theyre talking about football
4557785 we just said leave him be let him do his thing
4557786 actually we started talking before that the pastor was 45 minutes late for the ceremony so i was talking to jason before the wedding
4557787 i hope we can stay with this one system for awhile
4557788 i think one voice is pretty much the ultimate goal of any coach or coordinator who wants to run an offense
4557789 we got into a system last year where everyone thought it was ok everyone thought what we did was ok and we ended up being ok we were average we could have been great we have great players we had a great scheme i just think we got mixed up a lot im not going to blame it on any one person you can blame it on the players i can blame it on myself i should have made more plays
4557790 coach gibbs is a great coach and coach saunders is a great coach but they each had their way that they wanted to do it now we have one way with coach zorn and we have the players that we can do whatever we want
4557791 things are starting to come to me but its all about winning games
4557792 you can throw for three touchdowns in a game and play well but if you dont win thats what people are going to remember
4557793 everything were doing is about things that directly correlate to playing quarterback
4557794 were working on jasons stance in the pocket all the time making sure he keeps his vision even when there are distractions we dont just drop back seven steps every time against no pass rush and then throw that just doesnt happen in the game that much
4557795 i know who the other guys in this division are but i have to concentrate on just doing my job first
4557796 thats the emphasis right now last year at this time there was a lot of pressure on eli manning because people thought he hadnt done enough but you see how they stuck with him and he came around
4557797 when he doesnt like what happens on a play if the quarterback makes a mistake he turns around looks at the rest of the quarterbacks and says get back nbsp
4557798 he does it every time even if were all back behind the line
4557799 when official interest rates move that those moves should be passed on to consumers
4557800 i think that means that theres no obvious reason that the banks could not pass through any change in the cash rate
4557801 so the fact that the cost of borrowing money has dropped over the last 10 days has had limited impact
4557802 basically we have a situation where all of the term deposits are rolling over at the moment at a higher rate of around 150 200 basis points and all of the long term funding we are rolling over at a higher rate
4557803 the good news is that in a pinch the rba has a big 7 25 percentage points to work with
4557804 fails to fairly inform the voter in clear and unambiguous language of the chief purposes of the amendment
4557805 ballot titles and summaries cannot fly under false colors or hide the ball as to the proposed amendments true effect
4557806 i dont think we would do the appeal if we didnt think theres a reasonable basis for success
4557807 we will continue to fight against the amendment until all appeals are exhausted and we are certain that floridas hardworking families are free from this crippling tax increase
4557808 here you have an even more compelling reason to pass it through because you have a court now saying it wont be on the ballot and so theres a real immediate need for review in that case
4557809 the worst part of this is for patients who are uneasy and have nervous anxiety its only made that worse
4557810 and rightfully so because if they do become ill im not sure what were going to do
4557811 like some other hospital services the inpatient psychiatric program is not consistently profitable however profitability is not a factor in discontinuing this service
4557812 we are closing the unit because we have a shortage of psychiatrists and are unable to continue to provide a quality service to our community
4557813 there are certain surgical procedures where one procedure can be the equivalent of the billing for a whole year
4557814 i love love love columbia and im seriously thinking about moving because i cant believe this community is sitting back and letting this happen
4557815 who is going to be the next person up there on a bridge i hope thats not what its going to take to wake people up
4557816 there are ways to operate those beds in the black so to speak
4557817 with the intent to deceive and for the purpose of obtaining something of value
4557818 we take all necessary efforts to comply with applicable law including immigration laws

4557825 la medicina b sica para combatir la leishmaniasis sigue siendo el antimonio que fue descubierto en 1912 y que es muy t xico para los pacientes necesitamos medicinas que no perjudiquen tanto al paciente
4557826 aplaudo que el ministro santos se interese por la seguridad
4557827 fair notice of the content and sweep of the proposal
4557828 the impression given to the voters is that this is a guarantee that the eliminated local taxes will be permanently replaced by new state revenue on a permanent basis the proposed amendment does not do this

4557830 federal prosecutors are not charging the sitting senator with any additional crimes but they are laying out the new allegations in an effort to show a pattern of lying on his senate financial disclosure reports
4557831 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4557832 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4557833 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4557834 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4557835 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4557836 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4557837 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4557838 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4557839 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4557840 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4557841 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4557842 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4557843 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4557844 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4557845 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4557846 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4557847 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4557848 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4557849 john mccain is heavily politicizing this process that is weird when one of the participants in the process is a guy who has taken 900 000 from the georgia government
4557850 a member of the board of directors of the u s committee on nato
4557851 for a country like georgia what they are trying to do essentially is get meetings to get noticed to further their goals what randy scheunemann was essentially trying to do is build relationships between key decision makers in the white house and in congress to sell the notion that this is a vital democracy
4557852 this isnt just a war against terrorists anymore america now needs experienced republican leadership to protect our central european and central asian allies and keep russia from getting a chokehold on the wests oil elect us to save the brave fledgling democracies and to prevent the 12 00 per gallon gas that obama will bring us
4557853 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4557854 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

4557857 the financial market turmoil has meant that our funds rate reductions have led to less credit expansion to households and businesses than typically would be the case
4557858 while the second half of 2008 will likely be extremely sluggish the risk of a severe slowdown seems less likely today than predicted at the beginning of the year
4557859 at the beginning of the year i expected the inflation picture to be better than it is now
4557860 we must be concerned about energy and food prices being passed through to core inflation we run the risk of persistent widespread price increases being built into the expectations of households and businesses
4557861 the ongoing challenges in financial markets indicate the continued need for substantial liquidity and to ensure funding for credit worthy businesses and households

4557878 instead of speaking softly and wielding a big stick as teddy roosevelt recommended the american policeman has been loudly lecturing the rest of the world while waving an increasingly unimpressive baton the events of the past few days serve as a reminder that our ideological ambitions have greatly exceeded our military reach particularly in areas like the caucasus which is of only peripheral importance to the united states but is of vital interest to russia

4557913 the role that were playing in this phase of our industry is to make it easier on our store fronts to be able to get content
4557914 imagine if every time you wanted to bring a product into a retail store you had to negotiate the rights were eliminating that work for the rights holder and the store
4557915 we do a lot of documentaries that have mixed media stock footage
4557916 we work closely with the technical teams to ensure those documentaries are able to make into the store

4557926 i take every morning for what its worth and i just thank the coaches for letting me go out there and show my talents
4557927 i adjusted fairly quickly and i actually think i prefer playing the inside right now
4557928 we have to do a lot more than people think
4557929 some people think were just down there blocking and they dont really give us any credit if the quarterback throws a touchdown but the work is still the same you still have to do the same things that the rest of the team has to do including the strength and conditioning part of it just having size doesnt necessarily have anything to do with football at times but it can be an advantage
4557930 since i was so heavy footwork was my main goal to achieve
4557931 i had to get quicker on my feet i had to become more mobile and i had to become more agile basically i had to get in a position so that i could go out there and compete
4557932 in our meetings he slows down everything and makes sure everyone in the room knows whats going on and understands the schemes
4557933 basically he coaches everyone one on one for your specific needs if you need anything or youre having trouble he makes sure that you get the attention that you need

4557940 the son magnus gallerdal is the rider and the sons wife is the groom the horse probably wont go back to the level its at but the wife hopes to ride at the one or two star level barring unforeseen circumstances i think he can certainly get there
4557941 the horse has to compete later to do some big shows in 45 to 60 days
4557942 so the decision was made to withdraw from competition here in order to treat the injury

4557945 a careful reconstruction of the analyses and reviews that led to the shootdown decision shows that the official explanation was in fact the real explanation
4557946 it varied depending on which experts we talked to but we got anywhere between a 1 in 45 and 1 in 25 chance
4557947 clearly nothing prior to usa 193 rose to that level
4557948 the risk posed was much higher than any risk weve ever seen
4557949 suggested only a 3 5 percent chance that the re entry of the satellite and its toxic fuel would kill or injure anyone

4557952 the ises ability to strongly grow the volume of transactions that domestic and international investors execute on our markets emphasises the ises attractiveness as a trading venue and its position as the dominant centre of liquidity for irish equities
4557953 this growth also needs to be seen in the context of the extremely difficult market conditions globally and the ever increasing competitiveness of equity trading in europe we are bringing new equity and government bond traders to the ise and we are continuing to harness new sources of order flow for the issuers of irish equities
4557954 the difficulties in the structured credit markets have resulted in a fall in the number of new debt listings in the second quarter of 2008 however this has been counterbalanced to some extent by the listing of new euro commercial paper programmes covered debt programmes and straight debt programmes in addition the first half of 2008 saw a steady flow of new funds to the ise a total of 213 new funds and sub funds listed in the first half of 2008

4558268 my manager and agent just called to tell me that ive been offered a guest appearance on a new comedy series airing on fox this fall
4558269 if our bodies are not strong how can we attain our goals and make ourselves respected
4558270 can you imagine if we plucked our girls out of their homes when they were five or six then kept and trained them and never let them go home wed have a hundred lawyers knocking on our doors
4558271 weeding away flab or removing non performers from their rolls
4558272 we have not sacked anybody as an organization we work on a performance improvement plan which comes in cycles i dont have the exact number of people who have been asked to leave but i can tell you it is around 250 or less and that too this has happened over the past few months
4558273 in chennai alone the poor performers maybe a handful less than five
4558274 elimination due to poor performance is a natural process all this while we had allowed these people to stay on but since our ramco virtual works platform a technology platform is maturi ng and since productivity levels are increasing we have cut flab our annual appraisal happens between april and july and the bottom 7 of employees have been shown the door
4558275 we have asked 20 trainees to leave they were all freshers who were not upto the mark none of whom we have asked to leave are in the middle or senior management
4558276 it is still a fraction but the good news is that the industry is getting serious of cutting flab
4558277 pharma biggies are trying to get a foothold into the generic space like never before the interest has magnified since the ranbaxy deal there will be many more deals to follow this year with the growing interest in generics and desire to gain access and grow in key growing markets in asia and russia

4558279 just as bajaj is focussing on higher cc bikes it is not refreshing its entry level models around 100 cc engines this is among the reasons behind the decline in its market share
4558280 it used to be around 91 92 at one time but has come down to around 65 last fiscal so we are not worried as we are losing market share only in a declining segment and gaining ground in the 125cc plus segment which is a growing market
4558281 no question of making investments in a segment that was not profitable and declining
4558282 we feel that all the segments would grow including entry level our new launches will cater to all the segments
4558283 when youre in an airplane you dont want your fuel to start solidifying

4558289 we have a pretty good idea on how to grow algae the biggest challenge is in the harvesting and how to extract it from the water
4558290 you arent going to find a fuel thats pennies on the dollar than what we find today
4558291 even if we were to double the volume we were to make in biofuels every year for the next 10 years were still looking at maybe this will impact 15 percent of the overall fuel supply
4558292 strong dollar is in the best interest of the u s
4558293 the u s believes in a strong dollar policy but wants the chinese to allow their currency to get stronger vs the dollar
4558294 you know there has been a change in perception of gold it is now being traded as an offset to the dollar and not the store of value or inflation hedge that it was being traded as
4558295 a return to the underlying fundamentals for the dollar should bring about a bounce in gold
4558296 while the united states may be in greater trouble than the markets realize china may be in less in other words the slump in the west may not be so soft in the east it may not be in a slump at all retail sales in the united states are falling but sales in china are going up at 23 per year even after inflation theyre going up at 15 the fastest pace in 9 years sales of gasoline are increasing at a 55 annual rate incomes are rising too real after inflation incomes are going up at an 8 annual rate in other words maybe china is not slowing down very much after all

4558320 the priestly ministry of christ is superior because it involved the offering of himself as a perfect sacrifice to god 7 26 27 and because it inaugurates the new covenant 8 6
4558321 because of what christ has achieved the ot system of approach has been set aside and a new basis of relationship with god has been established 10 9 14 8 13
4558322 for if that first covenant had been faultless there would have been no occasion to look for a second
4558323 if indeed the law had been the complete answer to mans need
4558324 the inauguration of the new covenant by jesus means the fulfillment and replacement of the whole pattern of approach to god established under the mosaic covenant
4558325 i sent an urgent request to the russian president through official channels to start negotiations to regulate our relations during military actions like those seen at the start of august

4558329 newly obtained documents prove that in 2003 barack obama as chairman of an illinois state senate committee voted down a bill to protect live born survivors of abortion even after the panel had amended the bill to contain verbatim language copied from a federal bill passed by congress without objection in 2002 explicitly foreclosing any impact on abortion
4558330 obamas legislative actions in 2003 denying effective protection even to babies born alive during abortions were contrary to the position taken on the same language by even the most liberal members of congress the bill obama killed was virtually identical to the federal bill that even naral ultimately did not oppose
4558331 nothing in this section shall be construed to affirm deny expand or contract any legal status or legal right applicable to any member of the species homo sapiens at any point prior to being born alive as defined in this section
4558332 obama said that had he been in the u s senate two years ago he would have voted for the born alive infants protection act even though he voted against a state version of the proposal the federal version was approved the state version was not the difference between the state and federal versions obama explained was that the state measure lacked the federal language clarifying that the act would not be used to undermine roe vs wade the 1973 u s supreme court opinion that legalized abortion
4558333 senator obama says if he had been in the u s senate in 2002 he too would have voted in favor of the born alive infant protection act because unlike the illinois bill it included language protecting roe v wade
4558334 said he had opposed the bill because it was poorly drafted and would have threatened the supreme court decision in roe v wade that established abortion as a constitutional right he said he would have voted for a similar bill that passed the united states senate because it did not have the same constitutional flaw as the illinois bill
4558335 tells voters that he knows that what he did is not in synch with the american people
4558336 unbiased documentation showing that the committee voted 10 0 to adapt a neutrality clause then voted to kill the bill the smoking gun committee report is irrefutable evidence of what took place that day
4558337 in my mind it will stop the shredding of the fabric of our community we must put opportunities in front of our children so that they can go to work and earn a living
4558338 to object to what you call government welfare is your privilege but its not something i can agree with

4558368 is an organization that is trying to broaden our definition of beauty through significant messages that persuade us to reconsider our thoughts about others but mostly ourselves
4558369 dove found the current narrow definition of beauty was having a profound effect on the self esteem of women

4558373 how can the prime ministers senior adviser possibly accept a position thats dependent on funding from the federal government while continuing to work part time in the prime ministers office
4558374 once again this is a government that is willing to bend break and ignore the rules when its most convenient weve seen it with the in and out scandal weve seen it with stephen harper ignoring his own fixed election dates legislation and now we see it with them violating the spirit of the accountability act
4558375 i feel the player loses value if he is not eligible for the champions league you cannot sell a player at the same price every club will consider that i have a shortlist but the list was always short
4558376 i think every manager wants another couple of players and im no different we are continuing to work hard to bring players in that will help the areas of the pitch that need some assistance at the moment
4558377 potentially one or two players are going to play out of position at the weekend in an ideal world wed have had a few more bodies in but lets wait and see
4558378 he is not completely 100 per cent at the moment he is still recovering a bit from pre season problems but hopefully nasri can be back in the squad
4558379 a reasonable target for fabregas is the second leg of the champions league game diaby will take four to six weeks and we dont know about senderos yet
4558380 usually the teams which have come up give you a good game and it is our target to win the first game
4558381 im going into it confident it will happen were going to have to see but i dont see why i shouldnt be able to play in all the games
4558382 you never know how it is going to react but hopefully i will be able to do that
4558383 there were times that it gets on top of me you have your friends and family and you need those people around you to keep you going it took a while for him ramos to understand the problems i had and how we had to deal with the situation at the time
4558384 he probably never had a player the way i played last season playing a game then missing a game because the knee wasnt right
4558385 well be disappointed if we dont we realise it is the next step for us weve got the talent to do it but its a lot more difficult than just saying it and talking about it

4558396 at any cost is a wonderfully convoluted tale of betrayal terrorism action adventure and redemption and yet ms adams still is able to work in some romance everything you could possible want in an action adventure is here you have weapons hand to hand combat good guys bad guys a madman and a deadly virus what more could you ask for ms adams has created a very detailed counter terrorist agency and has peopled it with both good and bad agents and you really cant figure things out until almost the very end i kept trying to figure out the good from the bad and was proven wrong in a number of instances which i thought was fun the plot is strong and very fast paced and i found myself anxious to get back to the story to find out what was happening next i loved jt here is this multi talented young woman that is the perfect agent and yet she always manages somehow to get hurt while working a case dan is a perfect foil for her ultra confident ultra capable and he still finds himself riding her reckless train of disasters the relationship between the two of them is fun sexy and full of misunderstandings i thought the sex scenes were relatively mild although graphic and sensual but they make a nice counterpoint to all the adventure going on around them i really enjoyed at any cost and would be excited to read more stories about the nassd agency

4558403 after consulting with investigators it became clear to me that they are pursuing certain technical lines of investigation which could be severely compromised if too much information is divulged to the public at this stage
4558404 very shortly we will be able to provide more information as it pertains to arrests but now for the benefit of the investigation it is more prudent if the information is kept until those lines of the investigation are fully exhausted

4558414 a constitution established a united states of america as a christian nation
4558415 i just have to say in all c that since this nation was founded primarily on christian principles personally i prefer someone who has a grounding in my faith

4558432 so he took me in the spirit to a great high mountain and he showed me the holy city jerusalem descending out of heaven from god it shone with the glory of god and sparkled like a precious stone like jasper as clear as crystal the city wall was broad and high with twelve gates guarded by twelve angels and the names of the twelve tribes of israel were written on the gates there were three gates on each side east north south and west the wall of the city had twelve foundation stones and on them were written the names of the twelve apostles of the lamb

4558890 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
4558891 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
4558892 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
4558893 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade

4558899 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
4558900 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past
4558901 hegel remarks somewhere that all great world historic facts and personages appear so to speak twice he forgot to add the first time as tragedy the second time as farce

4558906 the ats strategy continues to be finding and consolidating regional operators of toner service and cartridge recycling and providing these operators the leverage and benefits associated with a national brand name
4558907 during the second quarter we began rolling out the greensmart recycling program which diverts waste from landfills and creates an effortless channel for spent toner cartridges to be re used and recycled at ats we are committed to lowering the staggering number of toner cartridges that go directly into solid waste landfills in the united states our customers appreciate the help in minimizing their carbon footprint and we appreciate the opportunity to broaden the portfolio of compatible cartridges we offer at economical prices
4558908 the customer oriented programs that ats has pioneered would help us develop business for ats in our market
4558909 our bottom line this quarter demonstrates that we are increasing efficiency and carefully controlling costs even as the organization grows to support higher revenue
4558910 our team remains focused on identifying the most attractive targets for acquisition while we emphasize organic growth initiatives within the businesses we have on board to date our customers benefit from bulk purchasing power technology solutions operational expertise and efficiency as well as our recycling programs the owners of independent businesses we talk to are excited about the opportunity to grow and develop under the umbrella of a national brand
4558911 we heard a similar story quite often if a doctor retired or died or there was a merger or another practice took over the patients they patients would have difficulty getting their records back to take to another doctor
4558912 there were even stories of records being found in the rubbish bin in the doctors garage or even on the footpath
4558913 we found that all through our enquiry we would hear peoples stories and say what there were no rules or the rules would not accord with what most people would consider common sense
4558914 i think people wanted simplification and harmonisation in this area and thats what we have tried to deliver
4558915 we know the nhmrc was interested in us not making it more difficult to do research certainly i think they will be pleased with these recommendations and i think we have found a good balance between facilitating more research and respecting individuals privacy

4558922 now these men can get back to doing the work they love
4558923 our family today still feels that the ruling just proves again that the justice system here in new orleans is still flawed
4558924 the danziger case is yet another example of a police department in crisis and a criminal justice system unwilling to keep them in check

4558927 the significant increase in property values across the state has provided local government with a windfall of property tax revenue

4558929 when we started spore we were thinking about how wed make an engine that had the possibility of expansion so yes well add to the experience

4558945 fiji is of course free to arrange any meetings with forum partners throughout its time in niue
4558946 allowing ample opportunity for discussions before the partners leave niue at 9 40pm
4558947 there is therefore no basis to any suggestion that new zealand is somehow preventing the participation of the fiji interim government delegation in either the forum or the post forum dialogue
4558948 new zealand has by granting specific exemptions to its travel ban to enable transit through auckland ensured the opportunity for the interim government to front up to leaders in niue

4559003 separational contemporary christian music takes the viewpoint that the surrounding culture is evil so therefore what christians ar ecalled on to do is to come out and be separate and then to convert other people so they can come out and be separate
4559004 most effective strategy for accomplishing its goals is to create music that mimics whatever styles are most popular in the mainstream
4559005 so rather than writing this come out you must be converted music you simply present a wholesome alternative to the madonnas and marilyn mansons of the world you dont have to be in your face religious and you might even record a whole cd without a reference to jesus or god its more whats missing that defines it

4559202 the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it

4559207 t he essence of habeas corpus is an attack by a person in custody upon the legality of that custody
4559208 the important fact to be observed in regard to the mode of procedure upon this habeas writ is that it is directed to and served upon not the person confined but his jailer
4559209 habeas corpus protection is often expressed as limited to british subjects
4559210 n otwithstanding the power which the judges have yet where they cannot judge of the cause or give relief upon it they would not think proper to interpose and therefore in the case of imprisonments in guernsey jersey minorca or the plantations the most usual way is to complain to the king in council

4559220 does not follow that it was a part of the united states or that it ceased to be a foreign country

4559225 t he inhabitants of the said territory shall always be entitled to the benefits of the writ of habeas corpus
4559226 it was never the intention of the people of the united states in the incipiency of the war with spain to make it a war of conquest or for territorial aggrandizement
4559227 it is as it has always been the purpose of the people of the united states to withdraw their sovereignty over the philippine islands and to recognize their independence as soon as a stable government can be established therein
4559228 it is obvious that in the annexation of outlying and distant possessions grave questions will arise from differences of race habits laws and customs of the people and from differences of soil climate and production
4559229 until congress shall see fit to incorporate territory ceded by treaty into the united states the territory is to be governed under the power existing in congress to make laws for such territories and subject to such constitutional restrictions upon the powers of that body as are applicable to the situation
4559230 t he determination of what particular provision of the constitution is applicable generally speaking in all cases involves an inquiry into the situation of the territory and its relations to the united states
4559231 the real issue in the insular cases was not whether the constitution extended to the philippines or porto rico when we went there but which of its provisions were applicable by way of limitation upon the exercise of executive and legislative power in dealing with new conditions and requirements
4559232 whatever the validity of the insular cases in the particular historical context in which they were decided those cases are clearly not authority for questioning the application of the fourth amendment or any other provision of the bill of rights to the commonwealth of puerto rico in the 1970s
4559233 guaranties of certain fundamental personal rights declared in the constitution
4559234 doubtless congress in legislating for the territories would be subject to those fundamental limitations in favor of personal rights which are formulated in the constitution and its amendments
4559235 particular circumstances the practical necessities and the possible alternatives which congress had before it
4559236 under the protection and subject to the laws of the united states equally with the seaman who was native born
4559237 constitutional protections applied only to citizens and others within the united states and not to residents or temporary sojourners abroad
4559238 w ere based on long established custom and they were justified as the best possible means for securing justice for the few americans present in foreign countries
4559239 what ross and the insular cases hold is that the particular local setting the practical necessities and the possible alternatives are relevant to a question of judgment namely whether jury trial should be deemed a necessary condition of the exercise of congress power to provide for the trial of americans overseas
4559240 four of my brothers would specifically overrule and two would impair the long recognized vitality of an old and respected precedent in our law the case of in re ross 140 u

4559254 imposed in violation of the constitution or laws of the united states
4559255 section 2255 was passed at the instance of the judicial conference to meet practical difficulties that had arisen in administering the habeas corpus jurisdiction of the federal courts nowhere in the history of section 2255 do we find any purpose to impinge upon prisoners rights of collateral attack upon their convictions on the contrary the sole purpose was to minimize the difficulties encountered in habeas corpus hearings by affording the same rights in another and more convenient forum
4559256 avoid ed any serious question about the constitutionality of the statute
4559257 no court justice or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider an application for a writ of habeas corpus

4559259 the judgment of conviction was rendered without jurisdiction or the sentence imposed was not authorized by law or otherwise open to collateral attack

4559261 extinguish es these habeas and other actions in order to effect a transfer of jurisdiction over these cases to the dc circuit court
4559262 create s in their place a very limited judicial review of certain military administrative decisions
4559263 it is important to note that the limited judicial review authorized by paragraphs 2 and 3 of subsection e of dta 1005 are not habeas corpus review
4559264 it cannot be denied where a probable ground is shown that the party is imprisoned without just cause and therefore hath a right to be delivered for the writ then becomes a writ of right which may not be denied but ought to be granted to every man that is committed or detained in prison or otherwise restrained of his liberty
4559265 the great and efficacious writ in all manner of illegal confinement
4559266 a static narrow formalistic remedy its scope has grown to achieve its grand purpose
4559267 w hen a prisoner applied for habeas corpus before indictment or trial some courts examined the written depositions on which he had been arrested or committed and others even heard oral testimony to determine whether the evidence was sufficient to justifying holding him for trial
4559268 t he early practice was not consistent courts occasionally permitted factual inquiries when no other opportunity for judicial review existed
4559269 w hile the former adjudication must be considered as conclusive on the testimony then adduced
4559270 newly developed exculpatory evidence may authorize the admission to bail
4559271 where important testimony has been obtained which though not newly discovered or which though known to the petitioner it was not in his power to produce at the former hearing and where the evidence was newly discovered
4559272 if in custody on criminal process before indictment the prisoner has an absolute right to demand that the original depositions be looked into to see whether any crime is in fact imputed to him and the inquiry will by no means be confined to the return
4559273 where there was clearly jurisdiction and a full and fair hearing but that it might not be so considered when any of these requisites were wanting
4559274 the risk of an erroneous deprivation of a liberty interest and the probable value if any of additional or substitute procedural safeguards
4559275 a vital flaw be found in the process of ascertaining such facts in the state court
4559276 cu t through all forms and g o to the very tissue of the structure it comes in from the outside not in subordination to the proceedings and although every form may have been preserved opens the inquiry whether they have been more than an empty shell
4559277 liberty may be violated either by arbitrary imprisonment without law or the appearance of law or by a lawful magistrate for an unlawful reason
4559278 o n application for habeas corpus we are not concerned with the guilt or innocence of the petitioners
4559279 we are not here concerned with any question of the guilt or innocence of petitioners
4559280 t hroughout the proceedings defense counsel demonstrated their professional skill and resourcefulness and their proper zeal for the defense with which they were charged
4559281 w e are obligated to construe the statute to avoid constitutional problems
4559282 the canon of constitutional avoidance comes into play only when after the application of ordinary textual analysis the statute is found to be susceptible of more than one construction and the canon functions as a means of choosing between them
4559283 the requirement that the conclusion of the tribunal be supported by a preponderance of the evidence allowing a rebuttable presumption in favor of the governments evidence
4559284 regardless of whether this evidence was put before the csrt
4559285 does not equate prisoners who exercise diligence in pursuing their claims with those who do not
4559286 the decision to convene a csrt to reconsider the basis of the detainees enemy combatant status in light of new evidence is a matter vested in the unreviewable discretion of the deputy secretary of defense
4559287 limited to consideration of whether the status determination of the combatant status review tribunal with regard to such alien was consistent with the standards and procedures specified by the secretary of defense and whether the use of such standards and procedures to make the determination is consistent with the constitution and laws of the united states
4559288 any final decision of a combatant status review tribunal that an alien is properly detained as an enemy combatant
4559289 if in foreign invasion or civil war the courts are actually closed and it is impossible to administer criminal justice according to law then on the theatre of active military operations where war really prevails there is a necessity to furnish a substitute for the civil authority thus overthrown to preserve the safety of the army and society and as no power is left but the military it is allowed to govern by martial rule until the laws can have their free course
4559290 there is a reasonable danger that compulsion of the evidence will expose military matters which in the interest of national security should not be divulged
4559291 j udicial insistence upon that consultation does not weaken our nations ability to deal with danger
4559292 to determine the legality of the executives potentially indefinite detention
4559293 a pplication of the habeas statute to persons detained at guantanamo is consistent with the historical reach of the writ of habeas corpus
4559294 t he court should have declined to intervene until the d
4559295 i t is not necessary to consider the availability of the writ until the statutory remedies have been shown to be inadequate
4559296 the court rushes to decide the fundamental question of the reach of habeas corpus when the functioning of the dta may make that decision entirely unnecessary
4559297 traditional rules governing our decision of constitutional questions and our practice of requiring the exhaustion of available remedies make it appropriate to deny these petitions
4559298 notice of the factual basis for his classification and a fair opportunity to rebut the governments factual assertions before a neutral decisionmaker
4559299 uncommon potential to burden the executive at a time of ongoing military conflict
4559300 if an available procedure has not been employed to rectify the alleged error
4559301 any interference by a federal court may be wholly needless the procedure established to police the errors of the tribunal whose judgment is challenged may be adequate for the occasion
4559302 is in no sense a suspension of the writ of habeas corpus it is merely a deferment of resort to the writ until other corrective procedures are shown to be futile
4559303 an application for a writ of habeas corpus shall not be granted unless it appears that the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the state
4559304 if there is one doctrine more deeply rooted than any other in the process of constitutional adjudication it is that we ought not to pass on questions of constitutionality unless such questions are unavoidable
4559305 o ur opinion does not address the content of the law that governs petitioners detention

4559307 w hether one characterizes the csrt process as direct review of the executives battlefield determination or as the first step in the collateral review of a battlefield determination makes no difference
4559308 multiple levels of review by military officers and officials of the department of defense
4559309 was consistent with the standards and procedures specified by the secretary of defense
4559310 whether the use of such standards and procedures to make the determination is consistent with the constitution and laws of the united states
4559311 the court had no occasion to define the necessary scope of habeas review in the context of enemy combatant detentions
4559312 a careful examination both of the writ and of the due process clause
4559313 receive notice of the factual basis for his classification and a fair opportunity to rebut the governments factual assertions before a neutral decisionmaker
4559314 tailored to alleviate the uncommon potential to burden the executive at a time of ongoing military conflict
4559315 ensure that the minimum requirements of due process are achieved
4559316 i f congress had envisioned dta review as coextensive with traditional habeas corpus
4559317 uncommon potential to burden the executive at a time of ongoing military conflict
4559318 t he question of which specific safeguards of the constitution are appropriately to be applied in a particular context can be reduced to the issue of what process is due a defendant in the particular circumstances of a particular case
4559319 in immigration cases other than the question whether there was some evidence to support the deportation order the courts generally did not review factual determinations made by the executive
4559320 i n military habeas corpus the inquiry the scope of matters open for review has always been more narrow than in civil cases
4559321 the courts may inquire whether the detention complained of is within the authority of those detaining the petitioner
4559322 be tailored to alleviate the uncommon potential to burden the executive at a time of ongoing military conflict
4559323 the procedural protections afforded to the detainees in the csrt hearings are limited
4559324 common law courts abstained altogether from matters involving prisoners of war
4559325 a meaningful opportunity to demonstrate that they are being held pursuant to the erroneous application or interpretation of relevant law
4559326 must have the power to order the conditional release of an individual unlawfully detained
4559327 there are in effect no limits on the admission of hearsay evidence
4559328 hearsay for example may need to be accepted as the most reliable available evidence from the government
4559329 whether the use of such standards and procedures is consistent with the constitution and laws of the united states
4559330 we do not imply dta review would be a constitutionally sufficient replacement for habeas corpus but for these limitations on the detainees ability to present exculpatory evidence
4559331 provide for periodic review of any new evidence that may become available relating to the enemy combatant status of a detainee
4559332 will direct that a csrt convene to reconsider the basis of the detainees status in light of the new information
4559333 office for the administrative review of the detention of enemy combatants instruction 5421
4559334 annually the need to continue to detain each enemy combatant
4559335 to explain why he is no longer a threat to the united states
4559336 t he delicate power of pronouncing an act of congress unconstitutional
4559337 is not to be exercised with reference to hypothetical cases thus imagined
4559338 a facial challenge must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the act would be valid
4559339 power to order the conditional release of an individual unlawfully detained
4559340 when the validity of an act of the congress is drawn in question it is a cardinal principle that this court will ascertain whether a construction of the statute is fairly possible by which the constitutional question may be avoided
4559341 congress silence on the question of remedies suggests acquiescence to any constitutionally required remedy
4559342 t he writs history makes clear that it traditionally has been accepted as the specific instrument to obtain release from unlawful confinement
4559343 release of an alien from the custody of the department of defense
4559344 to hold that the detainees at guantanamo may under the dta challenge the presidents legal authority to detain them contest the csrts findings of fact supplement the record on review with newly discovered or previously unavailable evidence and request an order of release would come close to reinstating the 2241 habeas corpus process congress sought to deny them
4559345 we recognize however that the government has a legitimate interest in protecting sources and methods of intelligence gathering and we expect that the district court will use its discretion to accommodate this interest to the greatest extent possible
4559346 t he role of the judiciary is limited to determining whether the procedures meet the essential standard of fairness under the due process clause and does not extend to imposing procedures that merely displace congressional choices of policy
4559347 that the great weight of legal authority indicates that a federal district court could not properly exercise habeas jurisdiction over an alien detained at guantanamo bay
4559348 nothing prevents the president from returning to congress to seek the authority for trial by military commission he believes necessary
4559349 where as here no emergency prevents consultation with congress judicial insistence upon that consultation does not weaken our nations ability to deal with danger to the contrary that insistence strengthens the nations ability to determine through democratic means how best to do so the constitution places its faith in those democratic means
4559350 the military commissions act and the detainee treatment act represent an effort by the political branches to strike an appropriate balance between the need to preserve liberty and the need to accommodate the weighty and sensitive governmental interests in ensuring that those who have in fact fought with the enemy during a war do not return to battle against the united states
4559351 presents no credible arguments that the military mission at guantanamo would be compromised if habeas corpus courts had jurisdiction to hear the detainees claims
4559352 the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it
4559353 perhaps in no other area has the court accorded congress greater deference
4559354 the common law does not yiel d a definite answer to the questions before us
4559355 the writ of habeas corpus is itself an indispensable mechanism for monitoring the separation of powers
4559356 must not be subject to manipulation by those whose power it is designed to restrain
4559357 we are cited to sic no instance where a court in this or any other country where the writ is known has issued it on behalf of an alien enemy who at no relevant time and in no stage of his captivity has been within its territorial jurisdiction nothing in the text of the constitution extends such a right nor does anything in our statutes
4559358 the alien to whom the united states has been traditionally hospitable has been accorded a generous and ascending scale of rights as he increases his identity with our society
4559359 but in extending constitutional protections beyond the citizenry the court has been at pains to point out that it was the aliens presence within its territorial jurisdiction that gave the judiciary power to act
4559360 by reason of our sovereignty at that time over the philippines
4559361 difficulties of ordering the government to produce the prisoners in a habeas corpus proceeding
4559362 the courts opinion inescapably denies courts power to afford the least bit of protection for any alien who is subject to our occupation government abroad even if he is neither enemy nor belligerent and even after peace is officially declared
4559363 to support the assumption of a constitutional right to habeas corpus we must hold that a prisoner of our military authorities is constitutionally entitled to the writ even though he a is an enemy alien b has never been or resided in the united states c was captured outside of our territory and there held in military custody as a prisoner of war d was tried and convicted by a military commission sitting outside the united states e for offenses against laws of war committed outside the united states f and is at all times imprisoned outside the united states
4559364 t he foregoing demonstrates how much further we must go if we are to invest these enemy aliens resident captured and imprisoned abroad with standing to demand access to our courts
4559365 in extending constitutional protections beyond the citizenry the court has been at pains to point out that it was the aliens presence within its territorial jurisdiction that gave the judiciary power to act
4559366 we have pointed out that the privilege of litigation has been extended to aliens whether friendly or enemy only because permitting their presence in the country implied protection no such basis can be invoked here for these prisoners at no relevant time were within any territory over which the united states is sovereign and the scenes of their offense their capture their trial and their punishment were all beyond the territorial jurisdiction of any court of the united states
4559367 the real issue in the insular cases was not whether the constitution extended to the philippines or porto rico when we went there but which of its provisions were applicable by way of limitation upon the exercise of executive and legislative power in dealing with new conditions and requirements
4559368 the constitution of the united states is in force in porto rico as it is wherever and whenever the sovereign power of that government is exerted
4559369 if citizenship had been the only relevant factor in the case it would have been necessary for the court to overturn ross something justices harlan and frankfurter were unwilling to do
4559370 fall well short of the procedures and adversarial mechanisms that would eliminate the need for habeas corpus review
4559371 it would be possible for the political branches to govern without legal constraint
4559372 the very foundation of the power of the federal courts to declare acts of congress unconstitutional lies in the power and duty of those courts to decide cases and controversies properly before them
4559373 it would be possible for the political branches to govern without legal constraint
4559374 the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it
4559375 t o foreign dominions which belong to a prince who succeeds to the throne of england this court has no power to send any writ of any kind we cannot send a habeas corpus to scotland
4559376 stood alongside magna charta and the english bill of rights of 1689 as a towering common law lighthouse of liberty a beacon by which framing lawyers in america consciously steered their course
4559377 may be directed and run into any county palatine the cinque ports or other privileged places within the kingdom of england dominion of wales or town of berwick upon tweed and the islands of jersey or guernsey
4559378 scotland remained a foreign dominion of the prince who succeeded to the english throne
4559379 union did not extend the prerogative of the english crown to scotland
4559380 t he position that united states citizens throughout the world may be entitled to habeas corpus rights is precisely the position that this court adopted in eisentrager see 339 u s at 769 770 even while holding that aliens abroad did not have habeas corpus rights
4559381 the common law of england is not to be taken in all respects to be that of america our ancestors brought with them its general principles and claimed it as their birthright but they brought with them and adopted only that portion which was applicable to their situation
4559382 when the government reaches out to punish a citizen who is abroad the shield which the bill of rights and other parts of the constitution provide to protect his life and liberty should not be stripped away just because he happens to be in another land
4559383 t he distinction between citizens and aliens follows from the undoubted proposition that the constitution does not create nor do general principles of law create any juridical relation between our country and some undefined limitless class of noncitizens who are beyond our territory
4559384 the political branches consistent with their independent obligations to interpret and uphold the constitution can engage in a genuine debate about how best to preserve constitutional values while protecting the nation from terrorism
4559385 careful not to foreclose the possibility that the protections of the suspension clause have expanded along with post 1789 developments that define the present scope of the writ
4559386 subject to the sovereignty and dominion of the united states
4559387 its subjugation did not compel the united states while they held it to regard it as part of their dominions nor to give to it any form of civil government nor to extend to it our laws
4559388 no one who reads the courts opinion in rasul could seriously doubt that the jurisdictional question must be answered the same way in purely constitutional cases

4559405 there is very little enthusiasm for mccain with people i network with
4559406 his voting record on social conservative issues for the most part is good
4559407 it is a matter of enthusiasm he is a hard guy to get enthusiastic about and why i just dont know
4559408 he hasnt done anything to offend hes just ignored them and they dont like to be ignored
4559409 i think if he wants to re create the intensity that has been within the base in the last two election cycles which i think personally you are going to need to win i think he has to make social issues a part of his political portfolio that he talks about
4559410 our belief is that during the remainder of the general election we will be able to make a compelling case as to why people of faith and christians in this country do have very compelling reasons to vote for and support john mccain
4559411 beyond the choice of his running mate sen mccains comments raise questions about the type of individuals he would appoint to other important positions like hhs secretary and even judgeships
4559412 as it becomes clearer and clearer that a barack obama administration would be a disaster the numbers will be there

4559769 you are much more reluctant to be nasty with somebody who is a sole provider of an essential service

4559780 i dont get it you cant be a positive person all of the time how do you do it
4559781 each morning i wake up and say to myself jerry you have two choices today you can choose to be in a good mood or you can choose to be in a bad mood i choose to be in a good mood each time something bad happens i can choose to be a victim or i can choose to learn from it i choose to learn from it every time someone comes to me complaining i can choose to accept their complaining or i can point out the positive side of life i choose the positive side of life
4559782 life is all about choices when you cut away all the junk every situation is a choice you choose how you react to situations you choose how people will affect your mood you choose to be in a good mood or bad mood the bottom line its your choice how you live life
4559783 the first thing that went through my mind was that i should have locked the back door
4559784 then as i lay on the floor i remembered that i had two choices i could choose to live or i could choose to die i chose to live
4559785 well there was a big burly nurse shouting questions at me
4559786 she asked if i was allergic to anything yes i replied the doctors and nurses stopped working as they waited for my reply i took a deep breath and yelled bullets over their laughter i told them i am choosing to live operate on me as if i am alive not dead

4559792 good for her she was able to do it im never going to i just cant do it
4559793 old brick on the bottom new vinyl on the top
4559794 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4559795 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4559796 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4559797 this is a planning took where all things are going
4559798 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4559799 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4559800 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4559801 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4559802 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4559803 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4559804 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4559805 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4559806 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4559807 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4559808 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4559809 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4559810 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4559811 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4559812 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4559813 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4559814 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4559815 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4559816 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4559817 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4559818 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4559819 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4559820 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4559821 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4559822 why do you think the team held off on doing any refactoring until the end
4559823 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4559824 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4559825 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4559826 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4559827 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4559828 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4559829 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4559830 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4559831 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4559832 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4559833 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4559834 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4559835 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4559836 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4559837 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4559838 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4559839 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4559840 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4559841 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4559842 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4559843 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4559844 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4559845 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4559846 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4559847 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4559848 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4559849 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4559850 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4559851 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4559852 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4559853 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4559854 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4559855 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4559856 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4559857 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4559858 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4559859 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4559860 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4559861 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4559862 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4559863 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4559864 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4559865 i heard cole broke up with you i just wanted to do something nice for you its killing me that i cant be here for you now
4559866 whats wrong did you getting everything you wanted cost you everyone you ever cared about
4559867 i need to win back your respect and im willing to do whatever i have to to get it
4559868 stop im not going to talk to you about this any longer you need to go you lost this one dad please go now
4559869 you dont know how good it is to hear your voice
4559870 did he really think that would help win back her trust
4559871 this room is going to provide me with hours of entertainment

4559886 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4559887 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4559888 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4559889 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4559890 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4559891 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4559892 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4559893 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4559894 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4559895 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4559896 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4559897 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4559898 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4559899 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4559900 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4559901 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4559902 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4559903 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4559904 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4559905 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4559906 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4559907 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4559908 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4559909 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4559910 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4559911 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4559912 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible

4559920 i cant wait to get married we all deserve the same rights and i believe that someday not allowing gays to marry will seem as absurd as not allowing women to vote
