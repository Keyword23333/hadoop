5580029 wir fordern eine flexibilisierung des k ndigungsschutzes verkn pft mit vertraglich vereinbarten abfindungsregelungen
5580030 die tr gheit des demografischen wandels birgt zwar den vorteil dass die ver nderungen lange vorhersehbar sind
5580031 ihr nachteil jedoch liegt genauso darin dass unternehmen ihnen nur durch langfristige ma nahmen begegnen k nnen
5580032 die bank sarasin h lt ihren wachstumskurs unsere strategie und die damit einhergehenden investitionen sind langfristig angelegt mit dem forcierten ausbau unserer standorte und kundenberaterteams setzen wir nicht auf kurzfristige gewinnmaximierung sondern verfolgen nachhaltig unsere wachstumsstrategie und investieren langfristig in die zukunft der sarasin gruppe
5580033 das 1 halbjahr 2008 hat f r uns zwei seiten zum einen widerspiegelt sich das schwierige marktumfeld in einer schw cheren ertragskraft und einem reduzierten gewinn gleichzeitig konnten wir gemessen am neugeld an unsere akquisitionserfolge des letzten jahres ankn pfen unsere kosteneffizienz verbessern und unsere wachstumsinitiativen allen voran die bank zweiplus vorantreiben der ausbau in der schweiz und die erteilung der lizenzen in deutschland bahrain katar und oman zeigen dass es an allen standorten vorw rts geht wir sind damit f r die zukunft ger stet
5580034 liegt unsere operative akquisitionsleistung mit chf 5 2 mia ber den urspr nglichen erwartungen und dem definierten zielkurs wir bleiben damit in der erfolgsspur des letzten jahres
5580035 obgleich diese neuen kundenberater ihre vertr ge bereits unterschrieben haben
5580036 werden sie gr sstenteils erst im letzten quartal 2008 ihre stelle antreten und damit erst ab 2009 ihre st rke f r uns entfalten
5580037 zum einen werden sich die investitionen in langfristig angelegte wachstumsinitiativen in den n chsten jahren auszahlen und positiv im ergebnis niederschlagen zum anderen haben wir beispielsweise mit der bank zweiplus oder der verbesserung des verh ltnisses zwischen back und front office massnahmen f r die weitere steigerung unserer kosteneffizienz ergriffen wir sind damit f r die zukunft ger stet
5580038 das ist als w rden sie eine woche auf den notarzt warten
5580039 wir werden nicht so schnell da rausgehen wie wir reingegangen sind

5580041 bank sarasin is progressing well along its growth path our strategy along with the associated investments is geared to the long term by pushing ahead with the expansion of our locations and client advisor teams we are consistently pursuing our growth strategy and investing in the long term future of the sarasin group rather than simply trying to maximise our profits in the short term
5580042 for us there are two facets to the results reported for the first half of 2008 first our lower income and profit reflects the very challenging market environment at the same time we were able to build on last year s acquisition success improve our cost efficiency and push ahead with our growth initiatives especially the launch of bank zweiplus the expansion of our offices in switzerland as well as the obtaining of licenses in germany bahrain qatar and oman show that we are making good progress at all our locations we are well equipped for the future
5580043 our acquisition performance of chf 5 2 billion on the operating side is higher than our original expectations and the target we set ourselves thus we are building on last year s success
5580044 although these new advisors have already signed contracts with us
5580045 most of them will only start work in the final quarter of 2008 and will not therefore make a positive impact on revenues until 2009 onwards
5580046 at the same time we need to take action to improve our profitability
5580047 on the one hand the investments in initiatives to assure our long term success will start to bear fruit in the next few years and have a positive impact on our results on the other hand we have taken measures to further improve our cost efficiency such as the launch of bank zweiplus or improving the ratio between front and back office capacities we are well equipped for the future

5580062 i developed the concept of white shame to refer the pattern of feelings and behavior that i had begun to see emerge as i listened to various incidents recounted by other euro americans the euro american child i now believed is a racial victim of its own white community of parents caretakers and peers who attack it because it does not yet have a white racial identity rather than continue to suffer such attacks the euro american child defends itself by creating a white racial identity for itself
5580063 every time i tried to play the game with someone new i felt that i was about to be rejected i felt terrible before i said white id hesitate as if i were about to stutter as soon as i said the word the other persons face would pickle each experience was awful

5580069 the arrest warrants against these three men will have absolutely no impact on the campaign
5580070 we will return to the southern ocean whale sanctuary and we will resume our campaign of intervention against the illegal activities of the japanese whaling fleet we will not be deterred we will not retreat and we will never surrender the lives of these defenseless whales to the outlaw whalers from japan
5580071 once in the middle i got my rhythm once i got my rhythm everything clicked thats what im excited about
5580072 im excited as soon as i leave the stadium im going to forget it this race and focus on the final hopefully the americans will have a great day tomorrow
5580073 i had first attempt makes up until my pr so we went to a pole i havent been on except for a little bit in practice i walked out of the tunnel and onto the track and i started to cry it was just so overwhelming
5580074 i was there in 2004 my goal was to run the first 200 and then see where i am hopefully get a good lane in the semi final
5580075 we have a chance to get top three it will take a lot of work but anything is possible im very impressed with the fans here we had a 9 am start and the stadium is almost full
5580076 the client makes the decision i would have loved to litigate this
5580077 while tim is already a familiar face around sumner city hall it was his variety of experience defending prosecuting and serving as a judge that really made him a good fit for sumner
5580078 i think spanish golfer sergio garcia will have noticed the tear in rafael nadals eye at the tennis medals ceremony the other day
5580079 its appeal is just tremendous and we can bring that to the games it is exciting fast and spectacular
5580080 you can have the court in the middle set up temporary stands and have 10 000 people watching it
5580081 we have worked on becoming more viewer friendly and will bring an exciting sport to the games
5580082 we see that china has made so much progress and why havent we progressed
5580083 i will give a report on who should take responsibility
5580084 we need to give all of our baseball fans an explanation
5580085 reviewed the entire decision and is satisfied that no error has been made
5580086 i went to get one of my poles and it wasnt there
5580087 we bring the poles inside a tube and give it to organizers so they can take the poles to the place where we are going to compete
5580088 pole vaulters use several types of poles in the same event depending on the height they are attempting to clear murer who came into the event with the fourth best jump of the year had surpassed the 4 45 meter mark and was looking for the pole she was going to use to try to clear 4 55 meters
5580089 i wanted the officials to stop the event so they could figure out where the pole was but they kept saying i needed to go looking for it myself
5580090 that pole was essential if i wanted to get over the 4 55 and the 4 65 marks
5580091 i wish she took a medal from this because she is ready
5580092 if i somehow play well enough to win that will be huge
5580093 it is difficult to still play a lot of matches
5580094 i want to recover for the u s open unfortunately i have to pull out of this tournament
5580095 theres so many people concerned about me and who support me i feel very sorry but theres really nothing i could do
5580096 i didnt feel right when i was warming up before the race
5580097 i knew my foot would fail me i felt painful when i was just jogging
5580098 speculation swirled for weeks that liu was injured and he trained in seclusion before he first appeared at the birds nest on monday
5580099 i know i have the ability once my foot recovered
5580100 now the most important thing is to heal my injury i still have a chance next year after all im still at the peak
5580101 vice president xi jinping the most senior communist party leader overseeing the games sent a message to the general administration of sport on monday to express sympathy and encouragement for liu and his coach xi is widely viewed as the heir to president hu jintao
5580102 we all understand that liu quit the race due to injury
5580103 we hope he will relax and focus on recovery we hope that after he recovers he will continue to train hard and struggle harder for the national glory
5580104 lius sponsors also signaled full support for their star athlete taking out full page ads in english and chinese language papers and running spots on television

5580114 este esp ritu ol mpico es lo que hab a venido a buscar
5580115 el aporte de empresarios sponsors ciudadanos y con la recaudaci n de recitales
5580116 para m fue muy confuso al final nadie dio la cara ni dijeron qu har an con el dinero no se explic el plan de obras ser a bueno que este proyecto tenga un poco m s de claridad
5580117 es este tiempo no tuvimos ning n v nculo con alas nosotros pens bamos que hab a un compromiso serio con la ni ez por parte de los artistas pero de alguna manera nos sentimos usados porque esper bamos alguna comunicaci n y no la hubo jam s imagin esto
5580118 it was very painful the fact that you have someone telling you they will not help you because of who you are that they will deny your right to be a mother and have a family
5580119 the supreme courts desire to promote the homosexual lifestyle at the risk of infringing upon the first amendment right to free exercise of religion is what the public needs to learn about
5580120 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5580121 simply keeping a lid on 90210 riding the curiosity and anticipation into premiere night and letting all our constituents see it at the same time
5580122 need to be prepared to deal with families who are waiting for a miracle
5580123 sensitivity to this belief will promote development of a trusting relationship
5580124 when youre a parent and youre standing over the body of your child who you think is dying you have to have that
5580125 you cant say thats nonsense you have to respect that
5580126 when i hear that women are being treated unfairly in the workplace
5580127 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obamas varying position on the surge in iraq
5580128 first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure this was back when supporting americas efforts entailed serious risk
5580129 this is a particular concern when a candidate has a short thin record on the issues as in the case of sen obama
5580130 looking at hindsight obviously we would do things differently today
5580131 were we perfect absolutely not weve had missteps and those are the lessons learned it was over the last few years that we were able to incorporate all of the lessons learned that we have throughout this investigation
5580132 were not worried about it weve seen this movie before
5580133 there are bad storms and there are nice ones and this is a nice one
5580134 it cleans out all the trees it gives people a little work to do and it gets the tourists out of here for a few days
5580135 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5580136 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5580137 ive got a generator and ive got a concrete home that i built myself so i know it can withstand this
5580138 every hurricane that we have we have additional lessons learned and experience
5580139 this is a broad really diffuse storm all the florida keys and all the florida peninsula are going to feel the effects of this storm no matter where the center makes landfall
5580140 one enlisted man who was taken hostage together with other civilians has not been released as of now
5580141 they milf pulled out already of the area they let go of the children and the women but took with them adult men
5580142 but we are clearing kolambugan because there are reports some of the rebels disguised themselves as civilians
5580143 parents get angry when theyre spankingm and its not working
5580144 if a child gets spanked so often they just dont care anymore and will misbehave anyway
5580145 we are excited to welcome pc tools into the symantec consumer family and believe the combination of our two companies will provide additional value and choice for consumers worldwide to better protect their digital life
5580146 by adding pc tools we build on the market leading success of symantecs consumer offerings and firmly position ourselves for continued incremental growth in a rapidly expanding market
5580147 its a very very fragile balance of powers right now
5580148 but the fact that commodities are declining is overall good for consumers and good for the market
5580149 if he made a decision to go or fight against it we didnt advise him either way
5580150 we really did keep our fingers out of this one
5580151 president musharraf has been a friend to the united states and one of the worlds most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism
5580152 we will continue to work with the pakistani government and political leaders and urge them to redouble their focus on pakistans future and its most urgent needs including stemming the growth of extremism addressing food and energy shortages and improving economic stability
5580153 the united states will help with these efforts to see pakistan reach its goal of becoming a stable prosperous democratic modern muslim nation
5580154 there is a great deal of frustration on the part of the u s government with pakistans inability to follow through on what the u s sees as its clear commitments
5580155 it remains very much to be seen whether this new democratically elected leadership will really be able to follow through in a sustained and coherent way
5580156 it could actually be setting the torch to the kindling inside the country
5580157 i dont want the people of pakistan to slide deeper and deeper into uncertainty
5580158 it puts a lot more responsibility squarely on the government there is no more excuse any more they have to stand up and do things they cant blame musharraf
5580159 i really dont think he has been a factor for six months
5580160 he hasnt been able to do that while he was in the presidency and he wont be as well positioned out of the presidency to interfere
5580161 strong pakistan that continues its efforts to strengthen democracy and fight terror
5580162 president bush looks forward to working with the government of pakistan on the economic political and security challenges they face
5580163 all the time and effort and energy they spent all goes for naught and theyre going to have to start over if they are going to do anything or appeal
5580164 either way i think we are in a much much better position
5580165 any mechanism where this city can purge itself of wrongdoing
5580166 we have to abide by the order of the court well review with mr goodman all our options
5580167 i think thats the appropriate venue its been the appropriate venue all along
5580168 i think ive just continued to get better in the preseason in the games and in practice so this will be another step to take
5580169 to come to a decision like that weve taken a lot of things into consideration last year how orton finished the season training camp preseason games
5580170 in the end it comes down to a gut feeling that you have
5580171 completions turnovers to just the feeling we have on who can manage the game the best for us all of things like that
5580172 and the good thing about evaluating both rex and kyle weve had a long time to do it its been quite a few years weve had a chance to see both guys play
5580173 people make such a big deal about that my rookie year and everything but i think everybody on this team has gotten better since they were a rookie and not just me
5580174 that stuffs in the past and im just focused on playing good football now
5580175 my accuracy has improved my command of the offense has improved and just being able to play at a high level
5580176 both guys were in the same situation which is a good part about it
5580177 both guys played both preseason games with the same line i think we did about what we could to let them compete fairly for the position
5580178 i wasnt even sure what the contract situation was to be honest
5580179 no competitor will agree with a decision when it doesnt go their way
5580180 rex is a team player hes been in this situation before and hell do whatever he needs to do to help our football team win
5580181 we dont name any guys starters for lifetime or anything like that but we feel real good about kyle just like we feel good about
5580182 it is kind of frustrating wondering who the starting quarterback is
5580183 thats probably one of the most important players on the team is the quarterback now that weve got it all resolved and we know who the starter is then now we can get down to business
5580184 ya se puede hablar de hipotecas subprime en solbes cree que la inflaci n y el euribor podr an haber toca
5580185 our goal is to put this whole ordeal to sign in before you can post messages
5580186 insya allah caleg kami sudah diseleksi secara ketat termasuk moralnya
5580187 that is one of veras best dresses for a girl of your shape
5580188 we were listening to the piece about cindy mccain on npr all things considered and it just struck us very hard
5580189 im an only child my father was a cowboy and he really loved me very much but i think he wanted a son occasionally
5580190 im angry it makes me feel like a nonperson kind of
5580191 i saw him at christmas and birthdays and he provided money for school clothes and he called occasionally
5580192 what she found in town on the day of or the day before or the day after his funeral was that the credit card didnt work anymore
5580193 the fact that weve never been recognized and then cindy has to put such a fine point on it by saying something thats not true recently again and again its just very very hurtful
5580194 the company looks to hire the black sheep of the industry
5580195 there is quite a lot of material that needs to be put before the court in support of this application for bail
5580196 we need to come back at a time when the argument can be made in full
5580197 i will use the previous bail assessment report copies of the charge and the rulings of justices david bleby ann vanstone and tim anderson
5580198 i came in from a wide position and was able to take a couple touches in toward the middle
5580199 i had a small window to get a shot off and got it in there in the top corner
5580200 this is my first olympics so playing in a gold medal match is an amazing feeling
5580201 well rest up a couple days and it will be an exciting match
5580202 i think the great thing with this team is we use pressure as motivation
5580203 i reached out and i guess i over stretched it or something like that
5580204 its tough not being out there with everybody kind of fighting
5580205 training camps such a grueling thing for everybody coming out here and working hard
5580206 ive never really sat out this many practices in a row in my career
5580207 i think hes made as much improvement as anybody as far as getting back on the field
5580208 im going to push it as far as itll let me push it and when its ready to go ill be out there ready to play
5580209 anthonys got the mass youre looking for in the blocking game
5580210 so everybody would say thats synonymous with being a blocking tight end but anthony proved to us in the otas organized team activities and minicamp what really reliable hands he does have were never going to be scared to put anthony out on a route
5580211 short yardage goal line two tight situations i get a real thrill out of getting big runs for the running backs thats something thats important to me
5580212 he wants to go weve got enough video validation of what he can get done we just need to get him healthy and get him out there so he get can get his timing
5580213 if i can go out there and throw the ball with some effort on it and it not hurt well be good
5580214 im going to go by what my body tells me just like i did the other night
5580215 i knew it was not right im going to push myself but im also not going to force it to where im going to injure myself ive gone through too much the last year and a half to risk that
5580216 i think its important to get both guys back today might define how wainwright could be used but in terms of how the next two weeks shake out i dont think it makes that much difference
5580217 if carp feels good it allows us to do something different with wainwright
5580218 youve got to ask yourself would it make more sense for wainwright to get another rehab start
5580219 if carps progressing to the point where he is going back to the rotation it might make more sense to just activate wainwright and let him get stronger in the bullpen if not then it might be best to have him make another start somewhere
5580220 weve had more success near the end of the game
5580221 but i really believe the key to the season is whats gotten us to this point just play our game and worry about ourselves youve got to continue to stay focused on the team youre playing theres a lot of baseball left its not like theres only 1 weeks left
5580222 im sure from a personal level hed prefer to start but i believe adam also understands we may need to go in another direction
5580223 i know last year some guys had opportunities and some had opportunities that werent right
5580224 i want them to advance and they know that weve talked about that and im very open people ask why they stick around i dont know i never asked maybe im not mean enough
5580225 we dont have to re train anybody we look at what weve done in the past and try to find ways to make it better and critique but were all on the same page its a very accountable staff
5580226 youre not just leaving to leave guys arent doing lateral movements to leave our staff
5580227 when i go with bruce to dallas or cornell to st louis you walk into school with them and they know the custodian they know the cook they know the secretaries
5580228 its huge because it gives you the opportunity to develop trust and them the chance to know you as other than a football coach
5580229 we all believe in the program we know it works
5580230 the main thing is we feel comfortable with each other in recruiting in staff meetings on the field off the field thats a comforting thing
5580231 all of a sudden well start losing several that will be head coaches hopefully because of the success of our program
5580232 hes strong hes quick hes smart and hes got good hands
5580233 hes doing some real good things and hes done some great things all summer too were real pleased with his progress and hes certainly one guy were considering playing
5580234 the offense is complicated as everybody knows so im just trying to get that down
5580235 but its a very fun offense once you get it down
5580236 i got jammed pretty bad and he said welcome to mizzou
5580237 i made the switch to missouri and i couldnt be happier with my decision right now
5580238 brinkley is doing a good job a real good job
5580239 very nice when you get a young player like that
5580240 with him going down ive got some big shoes to fill no growing pains i need to be ready to play
5580241 id never played guard till i came here but i caught on quick i know the plays at tackle as well
5580242 that first preseason game there was a little bit of butterflies but ive gotten more comfortable as time has gone on
5580243 theres a reason why theyre here we needed some more depth and certainly quality players
5580244 it just gives them an opportunity now to get more snaps than what they would have to this point
5580245 he was a little sore monday but it was a good sore
5580246 he will be sore during the year as we go and well just kind of monitor how he feels
5580247 already there are advocates saying that injection sites are not enough that government should hand out heroin for free
5580248 others are now calling for inhalation rooms for people who smoke their drugs while i support various aspects of harm reduction i believe that we have to draw the line somewhere with regard to these kinds of measures
5580249 itu adalah kontrak terbaik yang pernah ditawarkan klub dan menunjukkan bahwa para pemilik siap menggelontorkan uang banyak jika menyangkut mempertahankan pemain terbaik
5580250 itu juga merupakan pemberian kepercayaan luar biasa buat kevin keegan yang selalu ingin owen tetap di sini
5580251 alasan gue pasang astro kan buat nonton bola doang gue dari dulu banget udah pasang cablevision kalau diitung itung juga sebenernya murahan aora tapi channelnya lebih sedikit apa sih yang gak gwe lakuin buat spurs

5580253 the politicization of energy is only beneficial to those running for office
5580254 if our national leadership cannot come to grips with a problem of this severity theres something wrong with the process and the people
5580255 every time the price drops americans just say ok the problem is solved
5580256 just having prices ease up a little bit at the pump did not solve the problem
5580257 well be right back to the pump price that made you uncomfortable originally
5580258 its unrealistic to suggest that alternatives are right around the corner when the infrastructure is not there
5580259 thats different than a two to four year election cycle

5580265 but a few years ago i asked some students if they knew what watergate was and they said that was where monica lewinsky lived
5580266 it also prevents students from thinking that the way something is now is the way its always been
5580267 the green bay packers almost always had the same quarterback
5580268 i mean for as long as i can remember brett favre was the man there
5580269 its almost crazy to think he could retire or be with another team
5580270 harry potter could be a classmate playing on their quidditch team
5580271 i wish it was sort of true being on quidditch with him would be kind of cool
5580272 we say join the club it makes us feel old too
5580273 i dont think its like you crown the homecoming queen thats not what it is
5580274 realistically i think were going to play a couple guys at quarterback and i think we need to play a couple guys there because there are different strengths that are involved
5580275 this year if youve got two guys that can contribute then i think they need to be involved
5580276 they throw well theyre smart theyve got great poise i cant believe how fast theyve picked up our offense its just incredible
5580277 that might be a bit soon but they have picked it up in a lightning manner
5580278 i thought he was one of the two most productive outside linebackers
5580279 suppose i never ever met you suppose we never fell in love suppose i never ever let you kiss me so sweet and so soft

5580287 you all know we have bent as far backward as possible to give peace a chance
5580288 the patience of our soldiers in trying to uphold the primacy of the peace process is very commendable but at some point we really have to act decisively
5580289 we regret the loss of lives and property in lanao del norte but we would to emphasise that the milf leadership has not authorised these actions
5580290 if they cant control them the government will certainly control them and we will undertake our mandate to protect the people and the communities and we cannot renege on that constitutional mandate
5580291 we will pursue and take aggressive action against the perpetrators of the dastardly acts committed against innocent civilians

5580306 one of the best ways to have a great attacking team attacking style of play is to have offensive players who are comfortable and confident in their defense and ultimately in their goalkeeper
5580307 and to have a world class goalkeeper behind them is to believe that youre going to have a clean sheet and not give up goals it gives you the confidence to go forward attack and score goals
5580308 we remain out there looking and prodding and trying to find probably an attacking player that would fit that mold
5580309 if we can find the right player for the team with the right chemistry and again that pride and everything that is important to us other than just a mercenary player then it certainly is out there as a possibility if an opportunity is out there that fits we will not be shy about it

5580341 she was a chameleon she could make outsiders see her in any way that she wanted while behind closed doors she would beat at least one of us every day
5580342 she left all of us struggling we just never learned how to cope with life our father meanwhile was a good man my only hope for him was that he would outlive her just long enough to know some happiness only he didnt

5580345 bank sarasin is progressing well along its growth path our strategy along with the associated investments is geared to the long term by pushing ahead with the expansion of our locations and client advisor teams we are consistently pursuing our growth strategy and investing in the long term future of the sarasin group rather than simply trying to maximise our profits in the short term
5580346 for us there are two facets to the results reported for the first half of 2008 first our lower income and profit reflects the very challenging market environment at the same time we were able to build on last year s acquisition success improve our cost efficiency and push ahead with our growth initiatives especially the launch of bank zweiplus the expansion of our offices in switzerland as well as the obtaining of licenses in germany bahrain qatar and oman show that we are making good progress at all our locations we are well equipped for the future
5580347 our acquisition performance of chf 5 2 billion on the operating side is higher than our original expectations and the target we set ourselves thus we are building on last year s success
5580348 although these new advisors have already signed contracts with us
5580349 most of them will only start work in the final quarter of 2008 and will not therefore make a positive impact on revenues until 2009 onwards
5580350 at the same time we need to take action to improve our profitability
5580351 on the one hand the investments in initiatives to assure our long term success will start to bear fruit in the next few years and have a positive impact on our results on the other hand we have taken measures to further improve our cost efficiency such as the launch of bank zweiplus or improving the ratio between front and back office capacities we are well equipped for the future
5580352 die bank sarasin h lt ihren wachstumskurs unsere strategie und die damit einhergehenden investitionen sind langfristig angelegt mit dem forcierten ausbau unserer standorte und kundenberaterteams setzen wir nicht auf kurzfristige gewinnmaximierung sondern verfolgen nachhaltig unsere wachstumsstrategie und investieren langfristig in die zukunft der sarasin gruppe
5580353 das 1 halbjahr 2008 hat f r uns zwei seiten zum einen widerspiegelt sich das schwierige marktumfeld in einer schw cheren ertragskraft und einem reduzierten gewinn gleichzeitig konnten wir gemessen am neugeld an unsere akquisitionserfolge des letzten jahres ankn pfen unsere kosteneffizienz verbessern und unsere wachstumsinitiativen allen voran die bank zweiplus vorantreiben der ausbau in der schweiz und die erteilung der lizenzen in deutschland bahrain katar und oman zeigen dass es an allen standorten vorw rts geht wir sind damit f r die zukunft ger stet
5580354 liegt unsere operative akquisitionsleistung mit chf 5 2 mia ber den urspr nglichen erwartungen und dem definierten zielkurs wir bleiben damit in der erfolgsspur des letzten jahres
5580355 obgleich diese neuen kundenberater ihre vertr ge bereits unterschrieben haben
5580356 werden sie gr sstenteils erst im letzten quartal 2008 ihre stelle antreten und damit erst ab 2009 ihre st rke f r uns entfalten
5580357 zum einen werden sich die investitionen in langfristig angelegte wachstumsinitiativen in den n chsten jahren auszahlen und positiv im ergebnis niederschlagen zum anderen haben wir beispielsweise mit der bank zweiplus oder der verbesserung des verh ltnisses zwischen back und front office massnahmen f r die weitere steigerung unserer kosteneffizienz ergriffen wir sind damit f r die zukunft ger stet
5580358 what youll see is youll have 25 or 30 people lining up outside an affordable housing estate where there may be two or three residences for rent so itll be a bidding war basically

5580386 they became homesick and disheartened they lost all interest in everything and would sit in the same attitude hour after hour day after day with their backs against the wall and their gaze fixed on the floor at my feet they were dying of nostalgia
5580387 signifies a bittersweet longing for home holak and havlena 1992 it is considered an emotional state in which an individual yearns for an idealized or sanitized version of an earlier time period this yearning for yesterday davis 1979 is expressed by the individuals attempts to recreate some aspect of the past in present life either by reproduction of past activities or by the recollection of symbolic representations in memory however the past that is vivified is one that never existed for it is so idealized that any negative traces are screened out hirsch 1992
5580388 and as an organism in respect of the sacred liturgy also she grows matures develops adapts and accommodates herself to temporal needs and circumstances provided only that the integrity of her doctrine be safeguarded
5580389 small groups of believers even as few as 2 or 3 who gather in the name of jesus christ they are very similar to the earliest churches which were customarily designated in the scriptures as household units
5580390 we earnestly pray for the spirit of knowledge to be poured out upon the whole church and that the false doctrines and traditions which have crippled gods people will be exposed and forsaken
5580391 even though pneumococcus is very common until recently no one had realized that it could develop this pilus to reach out and touch a human cell
5580392 oral streptococci which are normally in the mouth and throat have the pilus genetic package and we believe pneumococcus picked it up in the back of the throat we decided to look at how the bacterium figures out how to use that package
5580393 when bacteria attack the lung there are two steps they need to do to establish pneumonia
5580394 they need to stick to lung cells and they also need to invade the lung cells our experiments were designed to separately test those two steps and we established that the pili are not used for adhesion but for invasion which was not understood before
5580395 so far only 20 percent or so of the clinically important strains of pneumococci have developed this trick of producing the proteins for making pili
5580396 in creating vaccines we want to use proteins that occur in a wide variety of bacterial strains these pili related proteins are not prime candidates so we can now concentrate on other proteins that we know are expressed almost universally by pneumococci and that we can put into a vaccine
5580397 current vaccines used in the developed world cost over 100 a dose and are limited to protecting against perhaps 10 to 15 types of pneumococci
5580398 but that price is far too high for developing countries and there are 90 types of pneumococci out there
5580399 these findings are important because while genes that cause hpe have been identified the interactions among those that produce hpe are not only complex but poorly understood
5580400 this represents a first step in understanding the mechanism of that interaction
5580401 this is good evidence for what has been called the multi hit model of hpe
5580402 in this model it takes mutations in both six3 and other genes in the sonic hedgehog pathway to produce the severe pathology of hpe
5580403 sonic hedgehog is a major player in embryonic development in the brain as well as elsewhere in the body
5580404 so this new understanding of its regulation in this very limited time and place in the brain helps us understand at a molecular level some of its overall role in brain formation
5580405 je ne savais pas que les choses se passeraient comme cela je voulais maccrocher mais je nai pas pu c tait intol rable
5580406 this finding represents a key extension of other studies on puma because such loss had never been shown before in human cancer
5580407 on the one hand patients receiving traditional chemotherapy can suffer the loss of immune cells and this loss occurs in part because puma induces the death of these cells
5580408 in this case the goal would be to protect patients bone marrow by developing drugs to inhibit puma on the other hand for patients with a lymphoma in which puma was inactivated drugs could be used to reactivate the gene to trigger apoptosis and kill the tumor cells
5580409 some t cell receptors are adept at promoting autoimmunity some are poor and some are protective it is not clear why one t cell receptor can promote autoimmunity whereas another t cell receptor on a similar kind of t cell either doesnt do anything or even protects against autoimmune reaction
5580410 this finding of an association between t cell engraftment and spontaneous disease suggested to us that there is some barrier to the development of disease
5580411 why are cells that engraft better more likely to cause disease we really dont know the answer once the mice start to get disease they get very sick but there is sort of a triggering point our findings may suggest that disease triggering in these models involves a mass effect that requires some quantity of specific t cells to ignite disease but we really want to find out whether it is the cell number itself or whether receptor recognition properties that lead to increased engraftment also lead to increased susceptibility to disease these are things we can test
5580412 these findings dont have a direct clinical implication right now but if we understand which t cells induce pathology and why and which cells are protective or passive we will gain a better sense of where to target what are called antigen specific therapies
5580413 those therapies try to selectively target the t cells that cause disease sparing the rest of the immune system
5580414 long has our nation the united states of america kept the forces of chaos at bay
5580415 by the blood of our people are your lands kept safe
5580416 strength wise its been great you just dont want to get out there and set yourself back obviously its trusting the doctors and head trainer ronnie barnes who has been doing this for 30 years so they are very excited about my progress and im feeling good about it
5580417 i always know what to expect of me and it always hurts to see your guys going out there and you miss the camaraderie but those guys know ive never been one to take any time off from that standpoint that is reassuring guys know me personally so most of my frustrations are gone to be honest with you my main thing is for everyone to see a healthy no 85 out there
5580418 its a four month surgery so im at four months
5580419 thats what i was told and you always want to beat the odds i think anytime ive ever missed time ive beat the time they have set theyd say 4 6 weeks and id be back in four but this is four months and im right at four months
5580420 its time to hand the torch to the next generation of young people to continue this important role of st jude in the international community
5580421 dr websters legacy is that he has highlighted the importance of the avian reservoir of influenza as it relates to human health
5580422 we now know that the avian reservoir is the initial source for all human flu he has helped the world understand that we need to keep an eye on whats going on in the animal populations and communicate with each other about those changes
5580423 richard has attended who meetings and has been accepted by the international community
5580424 effector t cells mediate immune responses like accelerators make cars go forward while a specialized population called regulatory t cells stop an immune response like brakes slow down a car
5580425 regulatory t cells actively suppress the activation of effector t cells that are reactive and damaging to self tissues thereby preventing autoimmune disease
5580426 in the context of an infection after the effector t cell has orchestrated the correct immune response and the pathogen is gone regulatory t cells can help calm down the immune system
5580427 in contrast there are very few that issue stop signals only two or three so il 35 is special
5580428 this discovery adds significantly to our understanding of how these cells prevent immune responses from running out of control and causing damage
5580429 to return to the car analogy il 35 may turn out to be a very important brake for the immune system
5580430 there is mounting evidence that regulatory t cells stop our ability to eradicate tumors
5580431 tumors produce a dilemma within the immune system on one hand the system wants to get rid of the tumor cells but on the other hand theyre a part of us thus regulatory t cells may prevent the immune system from attacking the tumor experimental studies have shown that if you can remove regulatory t cells or dampen their activity then tumor immunity becomes vigorous and the body can get rid of the tumor
5580432 regulatory t cells are seen as a major impediment to the development of effective anti cancer vaccines and may prevent sterilizing immunity in certain chronic infections such as hepatitis c and tuberculosis
5580433 blocking the activity of il 35 may reduce the function of regulatory t cells and their ability to block anti tumor immune responses so treatments that block il 35 activity may make anti cancer vaccines more effective
5580434 when i interviewed with dario he said the best thing about st jude is that your only limitation is your imagination and he was right
5580435 one of the best things about science is the fact that your discovery attracts the interest of other bright minds other scientists will hear about il 35 and say maybe this new protein is important in the disease process or condition that im studying by collaborating with others whose expertise is different than ours we can hasten progress
5580436 i believe this protein has a good chance of having therapeutic applications
5580437 im a st jude donor myself and like other donors i think its important to remember that at the end of the day the goal of our research is to treat patients especially the children we have here at st jude
5580438 the new information is important because it helps identify children who are most at risk for severe disease using easily available clinical information
5580439 this narrows down the patient population who needs to be considered for antiviral therapy which is costly and often inconvenient to receive from a childs perspective for example one treatment for rsv infection is to have the child breathe an aerosolized form of the antiviral drug ribavirin for 12 to 18 hours which is tough for the child and the parent
5580440 this finding is important because with cancer patients clinicians are used to identifying those at risk for bacterial and fungal infections based on a patient having neutropenia
5580441 we decided to analyze the course of rsv infection in children being treated for cancer to identify factors that could help us predict which ones were at highest risk for severe disease or death due to a lower respiratory tract infection with this virus
5580442 it is always gratifying to see one of the nci designated cancer centers achieve comprehensive status recognition of excellence not only in state of the art care and cancer research but also in patient education community outreach and the dissemination of vital information to professionals and the public
5580443 these extra efforts to establish programs that reach out to surrounding communities and patients are the hallmarks of our comprehensive centers which now number 41 this enhanced designation is a timely recognition of important contributions and advances made by the dedicated staff of st jude
5580444 being designated a comprehensive cancer center is a prestigious accomplishment and to be the only pediatric center is an incomparable distinction for st jude
5580445 st jude is well known for having innovative programs led by the best and the brightest faculty and staff now being awarded comprehensive stature places an additional nci imprimatur on st jude and further validates our position among the countrys leading cancer centers this also speaks volumes about dr kastans strong leadership as our cancer center director
5580446 its rewarding to see a designation of comprehensive to an institution that is exclusively focused on children
5580447 they have a huge population of survivors that they alone have the resources and capability to bring back for follow up studies so they are to be congratulated and envied in that they are the only uniquely pediatric cancer center in the country
5580448 our international outreach program directed by dr raul ribeiro is a wonderful example of how a medical institution can provide important services to local national and worldwide communities
5580449 in addition to the effective web based efforts st jude has a long and successful track record of bringing modern medicine to less advantaged countries through education of local health care providers and establishment of pediatric cancer clinics
5580450 while maintaining significant activities in education and community service st jude will continue its major efforts in both basic laboratory research and clinical investigation to better understand the biology of cancer and develop novel treatment approaches
5580451 this is probably the first description of what is happening mechanistically that contributes to the ability of cells to delay apoptosis
5580452 it provides incredible insights into how three proteins work and how they can control apoptosis
5580453 this suggests that the protein is playing basically the same role in humans as we described in mice
5580454 that was intriguing because several studies suggested that hax1 was controlled by cytokine signaling
5580455 also studies have suggested that if you overexpressed hax1 in cells the cells were protected from undergoing apoptosis
5580456 that additional window of survival is extremely important because in the body cytokines are limiting
5580457 the key observation was that hax1 was important in helping cells to survive importantly what happened to the mice we generated was remarkably similar to what happens if you remove the mitochondrial enzymes called htra2 or parl
5580458 autophagy is a cell survival jack of all trades and were trying to understand the signals that trigger its onset
5580459 this process developed so early in the evolution of life that at least some types of microorganisms must have learned how to avoid this defensive response of the cell to being invaded we want to know how invading microorganisms avoid being destroyed by autophagy and learn how cancer cells use autophagy to resist chemotherapy drugs before they have a chance to work
5580460 we suspected that because tlr signaling triggers both phagocytosis and autophagy that this signal might also link these activities together as well as enable each process to occur separately
5580461 this would make sense since autophagy kills microorganisms that invade the cell and phagocytosis deliberately brings microorganisms into the cell to destroy them so having two totally separate and unrelated sets of signals to do a similar job would be like re inventing the biochemical wheel
5580462 this strongly suggested that tlr recruits parts of the autophagy machinery to enable the phagosome to fully develop and fuse with the lysosome even if autophagy itself doesnt occur simultaneously
5580463 we can actually see phagocytosis take place in live cells and we can study it in detail so we know the steps involved
5580464 but autophagy seems to occur suddenly and we know about it only after its very obviously underway now that we discovered that phagocytosis uses some of the same biochemical signals as autophagy does we can use that information to solve the mystery of how autophagy works we hope that we will be able to translate that new knowledge in the future into improved treatments for infections and cancer
5580465 this motility is also called dancing because when you electrically stimulate an outer hair cell with a sound the cell body spontaneously elongates and contracts along with the sound
5580466 it is very dramatic to see these hair cells dance with the sound
5580467 we found that these mice showed exactly the same kinds of hearing deficiency as the previous knockout mice
5580468 therefore we believe that these experiments eliminate criticism of our earlier experiments with the knockout mice
5580469 with this study we still cannot really exclude stereociliary motility from contributing to cochlear amplification because eliminating somatic motility also reduces ciliary motility so it is not possible to totally isolate either form of motility in fact we hypothesize that the two mechanisms might work together in different aspects of amplification
5580470 for example an overdose of aspirin causes a high frequency hearing loss by inhibiting prestins function
5580471 also there is evidence that many cases of high frequency hearing loss are caused by defects in the cells molecular machinery that involves prestin and two mutations that have been detected in the prestin gene in humans are reported to be associated with deafness
5580472 in addition to fulfilling your new years fitness resolutions and raising needed funds for the children of st jude this is also your opportunity to be a part of history by creating a new guinness world record for the most abdominal crunches done in one hour by a group
5580473 im extremely proud to lead this national campaign to benefit a very worthy cause while educating women on the importance of strengthening their core as a first step to greater fitness
5580474 st jude is an incredible research center where doctors and researchers are committed to saving the lives of children with cancer and other deadly diseases
5580475 our family is forever grateful for the courageous people at st jude and all that they do ab crunch challenge participants will be a part of a vital team supporting the hospitals life saving work and ensuring that no child is ever turned away because of a familys inability to pay
5580476 gene expression profiling will help us identify targets for future therapy
5580477 it is still crude but in the end you identify multiple genes for further study if you find a good target for therapy the next step is to develop molecular therapeutics for the target
5580478 pharmacogenetics is important to finding out a persons response and tolerance for a therapy
5580479 certain drugs may be good for 99 percent of patients but bad for 1 percent we need to find out who those patients are who are at risk so we can spare them from toxicity
5580480 we need to know the leukemic cell genetics that affect drug sensitivity or resistance and what role pharmacogenetics plays in treatment to improve efficacy and decrease toxicity
5580481 that way we dont over treat low risk patients or under treat high risk patients
5580482 the new information is important because it helps identify children who are most at risk for severe disease using easily available clinical information
5580483 this narrows down the patient population who needs to be considered for antiviral therapy which is costly and often inconvenient to receive from a childs perspective for example one treatment for rsv infection is to have the child breathe an aerosolized form of the antiviral drug ribavirin for 12 to 18 hours which is tough for the child and the parent
5580484 this finding is important because with cancer patients clinicians are used to identifying those at risk for bacterial and fungal infections based on a patient having neutropenia
5580485 we decided to analyze the course of rsv infection in children being treated for cancer to identify factors that could help us predict which ones were at highest risk for severe disease or death due to a lower respiratory tract infection with this virus
5580486 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
5580487 edge vs undertaker is the current match of the year and i dont get how anybody can say otherwise
5580488 was it just me or was cenas application of the stfu really sloppy and unbelievable
5580489 im so tired of reading rave reviews for edge who has rapidly become not just the most overrated
5580490 it was definitely an honor to win the stanford st jude championship last year not only because of the talented field i competed against but because of the special place this tournament holds in this communitys heart and the wonderful charity it benefits
5580491 i look forward to returning to memphis in two months to defend my title
5580492 celebrating our 51st year in memphis the stanford st jude championship has a very rich history
5580493 it is the strong support of the community as well as the commitment from dedicated sponsors such as stanford financial group and fedex that make it one of the longest running tournaments on the pga tour were excited with the way this years field is shaping up and were looking forward to entertaining our fans with another first class tournament
5580494 many times physicians will look at a childs scans and assume that it is impossible to remove the tumor while preserving some uninvolved kidney but our study indicates that surgeons should not rely solely on the imaging to make that decision
5580495 in most cases the surgeon will be able to save normal kidney on both sides
5580496 the study indicates that when combined with chemotherapy and radiation therapy this surgical approach provides an opportunity to preserve renal function while maintaining a high probability of cure
5580497 commonly when a child has bilateral disease the surgeon will remove the kidney that has the most tumor and do a partial nephrectomy on the other side
5580498 but if a patient then develops problems in the remaining kidney the options are limited because one kidney has been taken out of the equation at st jude we try to save as much kidney as possible in children with bilateral disease thus far 100 percent of the time we have been able to save normal kidney on both sides
5580499 we think we have identified a pathway that can be used to prevent tumor formation and a potential target for therapy
5580500 we were interested in whether there were signals that inhibited tumor formation
5580501 and if there were which ones were they could they be used to identify new therapeutic targets
5580502 what was not known and what we now find is that the effect of bmps on normal gnp cells is almost exactly mimicked in gnp like tumor cells
5580503 what we a found is that using a lower dose of the sonic hedgehog inhibitor in combination with bmp gives the same therapeutic effect as high doses of the hedgehog inhibitor
5580504 we hope that by reducing the levels of both compounds we might prevent the secondary effects on bone of this potential therapy
5580505 many times physicians will look at a childs scans and assume that it is impossible to remove the tumor while preserving some uninvolved kidney but our study indicates that surgeons should not rely solely on the imaging to make that decision
5580506 in most cases the surgeon will be able to save normal kidney on both sides
5580507 the study indicates that when combined with chemotherapy and radiation therapy this surgical approach provides an opportunity to preserve renal function while maintaining a high probability of cure
5580508 commonly when a child has bilateral disease the surgeon will remove the kidney that has the most tumor and do a partial nephrectomy on the other side
5580509 but if a patient then develops problems in the remaining kidney the options are limited because one kidney has been taken out of the equation at st jude we try to save as much kidney as possible in children with bilateral disease thus far 100 percent of the time we have been able to save normal kidney on both sides
5580510 because the control of cancer in the bone marrow has improved so much cns relapse has become proportionally more important
5580511 if we are to further increase the cure rate and improve the quality of life of our patients we need to concentrate on preventing cns relapse
5580512 most clinicians still feel strongly that high risk patients need radiation treatment because they think that without radiation such patients have a very high risk of relapse
5580513 but i disagree i think that we should avoid using radiation in all patients even those at high risk of relapse with optimal chemotherapy we can reduce the relapse rate to a very low level we should reserve radiation for the treatment of relapse whats more the salvage rate for cns relapse in patients who did not receive prior radiation is very high and if patients who are treated with radiation develop bone marrow or cns relapse later on it is more difficult to treat them successfully
5580514 optimization of intrathecal therapy to allow adequate distribution of intrathecal therapy in the cns and to avoid traumatic lumbar puncture which leads to an increase in cns relapse are essential for the success of cns directed treatment
5580515 however there are no conclusive trials that show this approach to be superior to intensive chemotherapy
5580516 so whether transplantation has any role in the treatment of isolated cns relapse is uncertain
5580517 cns relapse may just be the tip of the iceberg meaning that while we may see cns relapse there may be hidden leukemia in the bone marrow
5580518 at st jude our treatment protocols involve detecting subclinical cns leukemia early and treating it aggressively
5580519 such treatment has allowed both good cns and bone marrow control therefore we have achieved excellent outcomes for our patients
5580520 it was because of his early pleas and his disclosure that a large number of the burglaries could be solved
5580521 you then decided to target the homes of people in the industry because they would be at work during the day and because they lived together they would have valuable items collected in their homes
5580522 these findings are important because while genes that cause hpe have been identified the interactions among those that produce hpe are not only complex but poorly understood
5580523 this represents a first step in understanding the mechanism of that interaction
5580524 this is good evidence for what has been called the multi hit model of hpe
5580525 in this model it takes mutations in both six3 and other genes in the sonic hedgehog pathway to produce the severe pathology of hpe
5580526 sonic hedgehog is a major player in embryonic development in the brain as well as elsewhere in the body
5580527 so this new understanding of its regulation in this very limited time and place in the brain helps us understand at a molecular level some of its overall role in brain formation
5580528 this is a call to the global community that it is possible to increase pediatric cancer survival even in countries that have high under 5 mortality rates for other causes such as infectious diseases
5580529 with a modest financial investment we can improve survival very quickly
5580530 that is because these countries have developed twinning programs with st jude and other institutions
5580531 the data show a modest investment in health if it is well organized can produce an incredible increase in pediatric cancer survival
5580532 countries with limited resources should not be afraid to tackle pediatric cancer as a national health priority because they can have decent programs if they make a relatively small investment
5580533 and that investment can come from outside sources as well
5580534 there were nearly 30 000 naturalization cases submitted to the fbi before may of 2006 that were most likely recently resolved
5580535 this is one of the reasons we see a similar name to someone on a terrorist watch list
5580536 i think what happened to ahmed is simply that he applied for citizenship at a time when there were a lot of security concerns
5580537 i thought oh my god i bet they think my client is this guy
5580538 it means good news like if your wife is pregnant and has a baby you say warsame good news
5580539 long has our nation the united states of america kept the forces of chaos at bay
5580540 by the blood of our people are your lands kept safe
5580541 this is probably the first description of what is happening mechanistically that contributes to the ability of cells to delay apoptosis
5580542 it provides incredible insights into how three proteins work and how they can control apoptosis
5580543 this suggests that the protein is playing basically the same role in humans as we described in mice
5580544 that was intriguing because several studies suggested that hax1 was controlled by cytokine signaling
5580545 also studies have suggested that if you overexpressed hax1 in cells the cells were protected from undergoing apoptosis
5580546 that additional window of survival is extremely important because in the body cytokines are limiting
5580547 the key observation was that hax1 was important in helping cells to survive importantly what happened to the mice we generated was remarkably similar to what happens if you remove the mitochondrial enzymes called htra2 or parl
5580548 decreased levels of transforming growth factor beta and increased levels of jnk are known to be associated with the transformation of myeloid cells into leukemic cells in humans
5580549 so those findings in our lab suggest once again that n myc is linked to aml
5580550 by eliminating il 3 from the culture we were able to unmask the apoptotic effect of n myc which greatly increased cell death
5580551 among the many mysteries surrounding autoimmune diseases is why they can sometimes take decades to manifest themselves
5580552 our findings hint that this delayed onset could be explained by subtle defects in the molecular controls on t cells
5580553 the itams we studied are little molecular tags inside the cell by which the t cell receptor communicates to the rest of the cell
5580554 the mystery we wanted to address was why the t cell receptor needs 10 itams to do its job why not just have a simple on off switch
5580555 we theorized that there were two possibilities why the immune system needs so many itams
5580556 one is that the requirement was purely quantitative and that the itams were there for signal amplification the second possibility is that different itams do slightly different things they do have slightly different structures so maybe they bind to some signaling molecules better than others and their positions in the t cell receptor are different so while our primary observation is that quantity is more important than itam type we also found that type has some influence
5580557 one implication of our findings is that a relatively small defect in the efficiency of signal transduction through the t cell receptor could give rise to a subtle failing in negative selection which gives rise over a long period of time to a few overly active t cells that might initiate autoimmunity
5580558 clearly from our studies there is the possibility that you dont really need a very big reduction in t cell receptor signal strength to have a defect in negative selection
5580559 we were surprised to find that many itams were required to make t cells divide and expand but only one or two was required to make t cells secrete cytokines
5580560 we believe this idea that t cell signaling acts more like a rheostat than an on off switch offers significant new insights into how t cell development and function is controlled
5580561 it was definitely an honor to win the stanford st jude championship last year not only because of the talented field i competed against but because of the special place this tournament holds in this communitys heart and the wonderful charity it benefits
5580562 i look forward to returning to memphis in two months to defend my title
5580563 celebrating our 51st year in memphis the stanford st jude championship has a very rich history
5580564 it is the strong support of the community as well as the commitment from dedicated sponsors such as stanford financial group and fedex that make it one of the longest running tournaments on the pga tour were excited with the way this years field is shaping up and were looking forward to entertaining our fans with another first class tournament
5580565 long lived cells like those in the brain arent constantly being replaced like red blood cells are
5580566 these cells must have a way to remain healthy for a long time getting rid of mitochondria that threaten the cell by making ros is one of those strategies
5580567 the fact that reticulocytes must eject their mitochondria in order to form red blood cells makes it the perfect model for studying programmed mitochondrial clearance
5580568 the identification of nix as a protein that regulates programmed mitochondrial clearance is a significant advance because of the importance of this process in the health of long lived cells like those in the heart and brain
5580569 our report reflects how adept st jude has become at designing and conducting even complex clinical trials for twinning through iop
5580570 this is a powerful strategy for sharing our knowledge and skills with countries that have excellent clinicians but limited resources
5580571 through twinning we can ensure delivery of state of the art therapy to children in other countries while identifying additional research opportunities
5580572 these findings provide new avenues to pursue to gain a better understanding of these disease processes and ultimately to develop better therapies
5580573 it really takes a series of genetic lesions to lead to cancer
5580574 you may get activation of an oncogene but you may also need activation of a tumor suppressor gene and an alteration in a cell death pathway
5580575 it appears from our study and other work published previously that all you need to get cml is that chromosomal translocation and bcr abl1 expression
5580576 the vast majority of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemias are of b cell lineage
5580577 the loss of the ikaros gene is a nearly obligatory lesion for the development of bcr abl1 all
5580578 and clearly must be a genetic lesion that is cooperating with bcr abl1
5580579 that is an important finding that may give insight into how that transformation occurs or it may give insight into a better way to treat the disease if one can figure out how the ikaros deletion is working
5580580 our findings show that children under 3 years with dpg can potentially respond better to treatment than older children
5580581 unlike other previous studies in young children where the diagnosis of dpg was based on either ct scans or magnetic resonance imaging mri the diagnosis of all our patients was based on mri only ct scans are not able to differentiate between dpg a tumor that occurs in the brainstem and other tumors which originate in the same area with a better prognosis
5580582 we believe that the more we learn about dpgs the more likely we will be able to design more effective treatments for children of all ages with this tumor
5580583 proteasome inhibitors are currently being used to treat some types of cancer including multiple myelomas although many aspects of this cellular process remain poorly understood
5580584 our study sheds new light on how that process works
5580585 we wanted to determine what happens to defective heavy and light chains in plasma cells so we could get a better understanding of the molecules and channels that allow these cells to get rid of defective proteins that cant be used to make antibodies
5580586 the class of cancer drugs called proteasome inhibitors block endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation as well as the destruction of proteins from other parts of the cells and cause defective proteins to overload this system
5580587 we want to fully understand how endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation works for antibodies made by plasma cells so we can design more specific ways to block this process in myelomas
5580588 our study shows for the first time the role herp plays at the retrotranslocon
5580589 the study also describes how non glycosylated proteins are removed from the endoplasmic reticulum and disposed of this information helps to explain how the process works and how we might design ways to block it in cancer cells
5580590 these findings emphasize that patients with aml especially those with high white blood cell count should be treated in an experienced tertiary center with a good supportive care team
5580591 for example at st jude we have a dedicated team of clinicians taking care of aml patients and they are more aware of the need to treat hyperleukocytosis are more experienced and are more vigilant in patient care than is usually found at a less specialized hospital
5580592 even though we had dramatically reduced early deaths in this group of patients in the latter period of the study the long term result for patients with these complications was still not good
5580593 we have continued to address their problems with new treatment approaches and have now improved not only the early results but also their long term outcome
5580594 among the many mysteries surrounding autoimmune diseases is why they can sometimes take decades to manifest themselves
5580595 our findings hint that this delayed onset could be explained by subtle defects in the molecular controls on t cells
5580596 the itams we studied are little molecular tags inside the cell by which the t cell receptor communicates to the rest of the cell
5580597 the mystery we wanted to address was why the t cell receptor needs 10 itams to do its job why not just have a simple on off switch
5580598 we theorized that there were two possibilities why the immune system needs so many itams
5580599 one is that the requirement was purely quantitative and that the itams were there for signal amplification the second possibility is that different itams do slightly different things they do have slightly different structures so maybe they bind to some signaling molecules better than others and their positions in the t cell receptor are different so while our primary observation is that quantity is more important than itam type we also found that type has some influence
5580600 one implication of our findings is that a relatively small defect in the efficiency of signal transduction through the t cell receptor could give rise to a subtle failing in negative selection which gives rise over a long period of time to a few overly active t cells that might initiate autoimmunity
5580601 clearly from our studies there is the possibility that you dont really need a very big reduction in t cell receptor signal strength to have a defect in negative selection
5580602 we were surprised to find that many itams were required to make t cells divide and expand but only one or two was required to make t cells secrete cytokines
5580603 we believe this idea that t cell signaling acts more like a rheostat than an on off switch offers significant new insights into how t cell development and function is controlled
5580604 a major issue we face in managing patients with recurrent sarcomas is the paucity of active agents
5580605 there is a limited number of drugs that are active against bone sarcomas and these are usually used as front line treatments when the sarcomas recur we have essentially no active agents
5580606 we were first very careful to see whether we would see any excess toxicity in children compared to that seen in adults
5580607 when we found that the combination was well tolerated we used it in more patients since our colleagues at rady childrens hospital were also using it for refractory sarcoma we decided to pool our data
5580608 further evaluation of this drug combination is warranted in these patients
5580609 target presents varietys power of youth campaign is a powerful one one that harnesses the energy of more than 150 young performers who are in a position to influence their peers and fans with the support of target and our other sponsors the power of youth effort has the opportunity to generate millions of dollars to benefit st jude childrens research hospital and create a bedrock of social awareness within the next generation of entertainment
5580610 our partnership educates and encourages young individuals to take action in their community
5580611 this event is important to target because of our long standing relationship with st jude childrens research hospital and the meaningful work they do
5580612 my father opened the doors of st jude through the generosity of the entertainment community
5580613 target and variety continue the tradition of entertainers giving back to people in need the dedication and enthusiasm of young hollywood and partners like variety and target enables us to carry on my fathers vision that no child should die in the dawn of life
5580614 our findings show that children under 3 years with dpg can potentially respond better to treatment than older children
5580615 unlike other previous studies in young children where the diagnosis of dpg was based on either ct scans or magnetic resonance imaging mri the diagnosis of all our patients was based on mri only ct scans are not able to differentiate between dpg a tumor that occurs in the brainstem and other tumors which originate in the same area with a better prognosis
5580616 we believe that the more we learn about dpgs the more likely we will be able to design more effective treatments for children of all ages with this tumor
5580617 the discovery is important because it explains why patients with sialidosis have enlarged spleens and suggests that new drugs or gene therapies that target that problem might be an effective therapy
5580618 the results also explain how the loss of neu1 can cause bone marrow transplantations to fail and therefore suggests that such failures might also be corrected by target therapeutics
5580619 our work represents an unexpected and important clue to one of the prominent clinical manifestations of sialidosis patients
5580620 we were surprised to discover that an old ubiquitous enzyme in lysosomes better known for digesting cellular waste products plays such an important role in a basic biological process that when exacerbated contributes to the outcome of such a terrible disease in children
5580621 the evidence strongly suggests that in children lacking a normal gene for neu1 disruption of the bone marrow environment causes the exodus of hematopoietic cells from the marrow to the spleen
5580622 that leads to development of the symptoms of sialidosis although we dont have a cure for this terrible disease we are now beginning to identify alternative ways to improve the disease outcome in affected children
5580623 the exciting thing about this work is that it sheds light on two major issues the cause of sialidosis and the reason for bone marrow transplantation failure in the absence of neu1
5580624 this wealth of new information gives us a better understanding of the physiological function of neu1 which appears to be much broader than originally thought this illustrates the important role of basic research in making discoveries that have major implications for medical problems
5580625 the discovery is important because it explains why patients with sialidosis have enlarged spleens and suggests that new drugs or gene therapies that target that problem might be an effective therapy

5580633 the lack of economic growth in the west will impact demand
5580634 each year the samaritan award is given to a broadcaster or organization that exemplifies the industrys commitment to serving the public interest through the airwaves
5580635 country cares is a program that truly embodies the spirit of this award as apparent through their tireless fundraising efforts and dedication to serving the patients of st jude childrens research hospital
5580636 jim nantz has received many awards and honors in his outstanding career with cbs sports
5580637 to have the honor to present him an award that bears my name will indeed be a very special moment for me
5580638 making eagles on the tour takes on a whole new meaning with the eagles for st jude program because i know my accomplishments help st jude achieve its mission to find cures for these special children
5580639 it touches my heart to see these brave kids they have so much courage to fight it makes me feel proud every time i make an eagle and it gives me added drive and passion to play my best golf
5580640 st jude is vital in the battle against catastrophic childhood diseases and we want the world to know it it is our hope that the eagles for st jude program will increase awareness for this special place and encourage golf fans and those who support st jude to donate to this worthy cause
5580641 eagles for st jude is a wonderfully unique program that shows stanfords amazing commitment to the kids of st jude it will be thrilling to watch the eagles accumulating throughout the pga tour knowing that each one will help support st judes ground breaking research and life saving care
5580642 give thanks for the healthy kids in your life and give to those who are not
5580643 i am so proud that these buildings are joining the thanks and giving campaign to support st jude
5580644 one of the main reasons my family and i support st jude is because there is always something you can do for someone else
5580645 it costs more than 1 2 million a day to run st jude so every penny counts whats really cool about st jude is that it doesnt matter about things like race religion or a familys inability to pay they are really here to help the kids and that is what is really important it is great to be able to encourage kids to learn and help other kids at the same time
5580646 at univision and at each of the local stations in the univision radio network we are proud of the role we play for hispanics in the united states
5580647 our work with st jude is another example of our commitment to our communities the amazing response of our staff and listeners since we started our partnership 10 years ago demonstrates the importance of the st jude message of hope
5580648 we are very fortunate to have the support from univision radio and the hispanic community to ensure that no child is ever turned away from receiving treatment because of a familys inability to pay
5580649 we want the community to know that every donation even as little as 20 a month makes a difference in saving a childs life at st jude
5580650 part of my job is to motivate people when i see this for myself i want to make sure we have a very successful radiothon
5580651 eighty five percent of every dollar received comes to the hospital thats a very high number for any charity
5580652 i saw every hallway every child and every smile as i was sharing with my listeners
5580653 it makes you feel good to know you are a part of this
5580654 showcase is a fun filled weekend of events for the whole family to enjoy it features mans best friend working to provide funds for the best friend of children in need st jude
5580655 this is truly a win win event because the thousands of out of town exhibitors also have a major impact on the memphis economy
5580656 we think we have identified a pathway that can be used to prevent tumor formation and a potential target for therapy
5580657 we were interested in whether there were signals that inhibited tumor formation
5580658 and if there were which ones were they could they be used to identify new therapeutic targets
5580659 what was not known and what we now find is that the effect of bmps on normal gnp cells is almost exactly mimicked in gnp like tumor cells
5580660 what we found is that using a lower dose of the sonic hedgehog inhibitor in combination with bmp gives the same therapeutic effect as high doses of the hedgehog inhibitor
5580661 we hope that by reducing the levels of both compounds we might prevent the secondary effects on bone of this potential therapy
5580662 we can all make a difference in the lives of others im proud to help st jude i feel like im just a regular person helping out
5580663 i have to be honest i didnt know much about st jude childrens research hospital before the create a pepper to fight childhood cancer campaign in 2006
5580664 that was my first introduction to the hospital and i was real excited about the fundraiser i got involved right away in doing whatever i could to make it a success but i have to say that this year is so much more personal for me
5580665 there was a pearl like reflective glow to her eye
5580666 we looked at them wondering if this was going to be katie soon
5580667 a lot of times in children as young as katie the treatment breaks down the bones in the face
5580668 they were tactful and truthful that meant a lot we made the decision based on quality of life concerns we felt it was best for her but that didnt make it easy
5580669 even people we just briefly met they all let us know that they were there for whatever we needed
5580670 we got messages and e mails from chilis employees all over the country sending us their thoughts and prayers
5580671 thats huge thats huge when youre going through this theyve given us all the time off weve needed to take care of our family were very grateful to have that
5580672 it was a shock to see her hooked up to the iv lines and oxygen
5580673 well forget that she lost an eye we honestly forget
5580674 we joke that every time she comes home from the hospital she has a new toy
5580675 once she gets outside she loves nothing better than just running through the grass
5580676 if we find a resource to help us and we think it might help another store we share it
5580677 i think this approach will be just as effective if not more
5580678 a certain man went down from jerusalem to jericho and fell among thieves who stripped him of his clothes and wounded him and departed leaving him half dead
5580679 and many came that way and when they saw him passed by on the other side
5580680 but a certain samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him
5580681 and went to him and bound up his wounds and set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him
5580682 and on the next day when he departed he took out two pence and gave them to the inn keeper and said unto him take care of him and whatsoever though spendest more when i come again i will repay you
5580683 one hundred and one years ago our people began a migration to the blessed shores of these united states of america seeking the freedoms and opportunities won for us by our founding fathers
5580684 therefore we who are proud of our heritage have met in washington d
5580685 we at long long last shall take our rightful place in this community of nationalities standing proudly with our heads held high in the knowledge that we have earned the right to perpetuate the name of our heritage and maintain our reputation as unquestioned good american citizens
5580686 with these thoughts engraved in my mind and my heart i shall call upon that powerful patron st
5580687 to this preamble i hereby dedicate my life and affix my signature
5580688 a series of complex developmental processes must be carefully orchestrated for the eye to form correctly
5580689 one important aspect of this coordination is that retinal thickness be the same irrespective of eye size for example the mouse eye is about 5 000 times smaller than that of the elephant eye but the retinal thickness in these two species is comparable
5580690 this represents the first example of a role for a myc gene in retinal development
5580691 on the basis of our data we propose that n myc plays a central role in coordinating retinal proliferation with eye growth during development
5580692 the determination of n myc target genes during retinal development may also contribute to the current understanding of retinoblastoma progression
5580693 importantly for retinas to maintain nearly constant thickness across species that have different sizes of eyes the total number of retinal cells must change several fold
5580694 the identification of n myc as a key regulator of these processes allows us to begin to understand the coordination of complex developmental programs in the developing eye and how these processes have evolved
5580695 all the things that i wish i had told him all the thanks the news i could still tell him the conversation goes on
5580696 surely you must have some sort of defense mechanism that enables you to look away from all that sadness or numb yourself to the horror of a dying child
5580697 if you go out to eat for lunch or dinner on september 24 by going to chilis you will help seriously ill children become the ultimate survivors on that day chilis restaurants nationwide will be donating all their profits to support st jude
5580698 there are a lot of heroes out there in radio who continue to make this happen
5580699 im just so happy and surprised by all the people especially in country music whove taken st jude to heart
5580700 he put on a mask too when we had our picture taken together
5580701 im just excited to be here doing what i can to help
5580702 the artists who come here need to take what theyve learned and pass it on the type of care offered here is revolutionary
5580703 all these people took the time out of their busy schedules to come here and help the kids
5580704 i dont want people to ever forget about st jude

5580709 obviously i have my own motivation to make as many eagles as possible but with the eagles for st jude program theres an even greater reward when i do so eagles for st jude allows me to share that good feeling that i have on the golf course and turn it into something truly lasting and meaningful off the golf course i feel like my accomplishments help st jude accomplish its mission to find cures for these special children
5580710 we are grateful to stanford financial group and fedex for their commitment to make this event even more successful than in years past to see a professional like vijay singh get behind our event and support it with both his time and his money is very gratifying we see the stanford st jude championship only growing and we know thats because of the sincere and long term commitment by these incredible partners
5580711 through their dedication nearly 75 000 chilis grill amp bar team members made the 2007 create a pepper to fight childhood cancer campaign a resounding success
5580712 this years campaign once again exceeded our highest expectations totaling more than 8 2 million for the patients of st jude bringing us closer to our goal of raising 50 million and making the chilis care center building we are dedicating today a reality
5580713 as we stand at the foot of the chilis care center in celebration today i want to thank chilis grill amp bar and our other partners who helped make this dream possible we are truly overwhelmed by your dedication to help st jude provide unsurpassed patient care and unparalleled scientific research and you can know that you have helped bring hope to thousands of children from around the world
5580714 the chilis care center is a significant part of our long term strategy to translate basic research at st jude into the most advanced and effective care of patients
5580715 integrating patient care and research holds the key to more rapid advances in science and medicine this new facility will help us maintain our leadership role in defining the forefront of research to advance the treatment of children with cancer and other catastrophic pediatric diseases
5580716 i see the other survivors and i know even though we shared a different time and a different era that we all have the same thing in common
5580717 we were all patients here at a place that was our last hope
5580718 i think its best described in the way brooklyn smiles every day how shes a beautiful vibrant outspoken 3 year old and the way shes so full of life
5580719 we speak frequently and proudly about the medical marvels that take place within the walls of st jude
5580720 but we all know none of this could be accomplished without the love dedication and financial support of each and every volunteer partner corporate sponsor and donor it is because of you that the most gifted doctors and scientists in the world come here to do their finest work
5580721 but because they are priceless god has blessed us with an army of truly dedicated individuals who are committed to the dream of danny thomas and the mission of st jude
5580722 i know if my father were here he would want randy to have this award
5580723 i didnt have the chance to know him as well as some of you but it shows you how a good man can inspire you in just a brief time
5580724 all of the materials are provided for you and are ready to use so all we had to do was make it happen
5580725 with st jude we play our music our format isnt disrupted
5580726 even if a radio station isnt ready to put on their own radiothons
5580727 they should definitely visit another stations event to see what goes on
5580728 the people that tune you in keep us moving forward
5580729 help me find my way in life and i will build you a shrine
5580730 this is a fitting moment in the evolution of the growth of st jude
5580731 richard shadyac is a visionary an excellent planner and his focus his tenacity his dedication and his passion for st jude are unrelenting
5580732 i became an arkansas state trooper i married my high school sweetheart i have two wonderful children and three grandchildren
5580733 how proud he would be of all of you how proud he would be of his grandchildren singing out for alsac and how proud he would be of alsac the organization that was born in his heart and built on his faith fifty years later you are still the warriors slaying the dragons that would take children from their mothers and fathers
5580734 the metaphoric rock upon which alsac was built 50 years ago
5580735 the responsibility of alsac is herculean in scope to maintain the largest pediatric research center in the world like the inn keeper who was left with the guardianship of the suffering man we at alsac also stand guard
5580736 thanks to the 13 chefs for their work in preparing the meals for guests and to mikey flowers who filled our space with beautiful flowers of all kinds

5580743 were going to have a banner hanging in our student union that says we are the 2006 2007 national champions
5580744 but the only thing harder than being no 1 is staying no 1
5580745 i have no idea if we are going to reach it but we will give it our best shot
5580746 for the first three years i helped peripherally i got prizes for their events
5580747 i saw it as a program that had a lot of potential
5580748 i thought it was something we could really turn into something big
5580749 weve had some great support and some great students and it has worked out for us these past few years
5580750 what i had been told about the hospital didnt compare to what it is actually like there
5580751 talking with students from other colleges and hearing about the programs that work for them was very educational
5580752 it gives us new ideas on what we can do at our campus
5580753 if we start making it a competition we lose sight of what st jude is about
5580754 we have 16 000 people on our campus and 10 percent of them participate in the event id like to believe we can get more than that if we do our job right in promoting the hospital the money will come
5580755 show me my way in life and i will build you a shrine

5580789 yes id seen weakness in other men gramps and his disappointments lolo and his compromise but these men had become object lessons for me men i might love but never emulate white men and brown men whose fates didnt speak to my own it was into my fathers image the black man son of africa that id packed all the attributes i sought in myself the attributes of martin and malcolm dubois and mandela and if later i saw that the black men i knew frank or ray or will or rafiq fell short of such lofty standards if i had learned to respect these men for the struggles they went through recognizing them as my own my fathers voice had nevertheless remained untainted inspiring rebuking granting or withholding approval you do not work hard enough barry you must help in your peoples struggle wake up black man
5580790 the relationship between black and white the meaning of escape would never be quite the same for me as it had been for frank or for the old man or even for roy
5580791 what had frank called college an advanced degree in compromise i thought back to the last time i had seen the old poet a few days before i left hawaii we had made small talk for a while he complained about his feet the corns and bone spurs that he insisted were a direct result of trying to force african feet into european shoes finally he had asked me what it was that i expected to get out of college i told him i didnt know he shook his big hoary head leaving your race at the door
5580792 understand something boy youre not going to college to get educated youre going there to get trained theyll train you to want what you dont need theyll train you to manipulate words so they dont mean anything anymore theyll train you to forget what it is that you already know theyll train you so good youll start believing what they tell you about equal opportunity and the american way and all that shit theyll give you a corner office and invite you to fancy dinners and tell you youre a credit to your race until you want to actually start running things and then theyll yank on your chain and let you know that you may be a well trained well paid nigger but youre a nigger just the same it made me smile thinking back on frank and his old black power dashiki self in some ways he was as incurable as my mother as certain in his faith living in the same sixties time warp that hawaii had created

5580802 i stumbled upon some nice plums at the market and when i think of plum i think bombay sapphire and pinot noir together i knew that vanilla would go well to sweeten the cocktail and it would complement the pinot noir the lemon peel is one of bombay sapphires 10 botanicals so it has its place in the cocktail but also gives a fresh citrus aroma and the acid that is needed to punch flavours the chocolate and lavender notes from the pinot will help complement the grains of paradise also one of the 10 botanicals and finally the bitterness of the campari will give the drink that final balance of flavour

5580819 she went for tests and results have come back and she has cancer of the womb
5580820 she was phoned up and informed this is a massive blow for her
5580821 i believe there is serious misconception about what is occuring and what will occur first and foremost the threat forward going is not inflation or stagflation it is deflation although it is true that inflation has been understated the cause of the inflation has been poorly analyzed compare m1 to m3 and you readily see that this is not monetized inflation but debt expansion inflation debt acts just like money to a point and that point is insolvency debt will say that my cdo is worth 1 00 but insolvency shows that the market values my cdo at 0 27 what happened to the inflation within the cdo it evaporated as all mirage capital must eventually disappear debt said my house was worth 500 000 insolvency and debt contraction says it is worth 400 000 or less debt said all those casinos being built in las vegas were worth millions that new york office buildings could support negative cash flows and that that copper was worth an all time high false perspective can drive a false demand leading to a bubble a bubble being that portion of the price of an asset that is simply driven by debt i e ponzi fincance anyone remember 1973 and 1974 when we perceived an oil shortage when none had occured or when all those builders paid premium prices for undeveloped land because low interest rates had caused an artificial demand for housing misallocation of assets that is what has occured the decoupling of the world is an illusion serious recession in the u s would lead to world recession and all those high flying commodity prices would come tumbling down along with it debt contraction is a deflationary event and it is the threat of deflation that is propelling the fed to slash rates which they will continue to do until we reach a real negative interest rate

5580835 my father owns an ice factory and it started from there when i would buy ice from my father and put it in the market it takes 48 hours to make a block of ice and we faced severe problems due to constant load shedding the quality and quantity was affected and this eventually hampered the production to meet the demands in dairies fisheries and chemical factories i started working on several concepts and what came out was a perfect design
5580836 it has a simple modus operandi the steam first enters the turbine and goes to the machine with a compressor based system i have worked upon and eventually generates ice at the same time electricity is generated as the steam passes through the turbine that makes the plant self sufficient i plan to generate 3300 blocks of ice where as a normal factory comes out with 150 blocks in a day i further plan to utilise solar panels for the factory to begin with i installed a machine in a company in agra that manufactures wheels for the railways and steam is let out in the form of exhaust the machine is now generating ice from the steam and for free
5580837 i have been working on the concept since five years my machine has been sent for patenting there has been a problem at every step from lack of funds to a lack of support but my biggest strength is my confidence and that kept me going i plan to start the plant soon

5580842 audrey was very determined always on the picket line always chanting even though she had asthma and had to use a pump
5580843 when she appeared on the line she brought everyone together
5580844 she was the kind of person who made everyone want to go the extra mile shout louder chant louder
5580845 we had the same last name so we used to always say we were family she made everyone feel like family when we came out on strike we all really banded together if you were on the picket line feeling down audrey would always ask how are you she would talk to you and try to keep your spirit lifted every time you saw audrey coming to the picket line you felt good
5580846 when i got the phone call that she was dead i fainted she was a loving caring spiritual christian woman i miss her so much
5580847 it goes to show that her efforts and the unions efforts werent in vain
5580848 our victory is sweet and its sour youre going back but without someone close to you ive been at kingsbridge 20 years with audrey she was one of those people you could always depend on she was always helping everyone no matter who they were
5580849 because san franciscos political leaders have already demonstrated their willingness to act in flagrant violation of federal law i do not believe that local judicial institutions can be trusted to fairly try the case or mete out an appropriate punishment
5580850 we need to remember always that a death dealing policy like sanctuary hides behind the false mantle of compassion
5580851 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5580852 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5580853 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5580854 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5580855 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5580856 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5580857 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5580858 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5580859 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5580860 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5580861 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5580862 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5580863 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5580864 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5580865 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5580866 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5580867 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5580868 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5580869 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5580870 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5580871 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5580872 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5580873 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5580874 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5580875 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5580876 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5580877 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5580878 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5580879 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5580880 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5580881 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5580882 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5580883 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5580884 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5580885 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5580886 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5580887 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5580888 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5580889 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5580890 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5580891 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5580892 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5580893 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5580894 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5580895 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5580896 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5580897 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5580898 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5580899 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5580900 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5580901 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5580902 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5580903 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5580904 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5580905 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5580906 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5580907 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5580908 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5580909 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5580910 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5580911 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5580912 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5580913 who are open to doing something on the production side
5580914 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5580915 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5580916 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5580917 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5580918 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5580919 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5580920 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5580921 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5580922 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5580923 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5580924 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5580925 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5580926 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5580927 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5580928 our car is a brand new design and the chev is on its way out
5580929 not a bad redesign but the engine power needs work along with few other minor things yet not bad
5580930 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5580931 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5580932 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5580933 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5580934 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5580935 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5580936 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5580937 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5580938 i went to get one of my poles and it wasnt there
5580939 we bring the poles inside a tube and give it to organizers so they can take the poles to the place where we are going to compete but they lost one of the poles somewhere along the way i dont know what happened
5580940 i wanted the officials to stop the event so they could figure out where the pole was but they kept saying i needed to go looking for it myself
5580941 that pole was essential if i wanted to get over the 4 55 and the 4 65 marks
5580942 i wish she took a medal from this because she is ready
5580943 theres so many people concerned about me and who support me i feel very sorry but theres really nothing i could do

5580947 i know i have the ability once my foot recovered
5580948 now the most important thing is to heal my injury i still have a chance next year after all im still at the peak i must be optimistic and i shouldnt blame everyone and everything but not myself i will not easily give up
5580949 we all understand that liu quit the race due to injury
5580950 we hope he will relax and focus on recovery we hope that after he recovers he will continue to train hard and struggle harder for the national glory
5580951 we feel pretty good with ourselves were not going to quit and we got back into it
5580952 with our ballclub you feel like youre going to find a way to get a big hit and tie the ballgame we just couldnt come up with one
5580953 we need to get back to playing how we played the first month and start scoring some runs it was nice to get out early tonight
5580954 ten days is a long time and i had a couple days where i wasnt doing anything so today was just about knocking the rust off
5580955 he was walking around trying to stay loose but pitching coach rick anderson and i looked at him and told him no chance
5580956 if the storm continues its current track and the road conditions are safe we will play the game
5580957 i think everybody in here will do everything possible to make sure it doesnt happen again its not in joes hands any more its in nobodys hands but ours
5580958 it bothers me we dont need to be talking about this stuff
5580959 it sounds like were not going to be hanging out and working on our tans
5580960 well just have to pick up the pieces and claw our way through this

5580963 but thank god my arm is ok its just my neck
5580964 theres so many people concerned about me and who support me i feel very sorry but theres really nothing i could do
5580965 i didnt feel right when i was warming up before the race

5580970 we all understand that liu quit the race due to injury
5580971 we hope he will relax and focus on recovery we hope that after he recovers he will continue to train hard and struggle harder for the national glory

5581007 it took some time for the realization to sink in that that pakistan is gone and that you are not going to go back to that pakistan
5581008 they continued to see him as a factor for stability way beyond what made sense
5581009 we have basically continued to delaying the process by which the new government took charge and started dealing with things time is important because they are dealing with an internal insurgency where the trend lines are bad
5581010 its been a balancing act and not always calibrated to best effect
5581011 at times it appears that bush in particular was coming out too closely aligned with musharraf and was tone deaf to the outrage of pakistani civilians at other times it was clear they were putting their weight behind a political transition that left to his own devices musharraf and his team might not have undertaken
5581012 well see if they can turn their attention to governance and get a handle on their problems
5581013 they have been using the musharraf thing as an excuse for non governance
5581014 once the government gets this behind them maybe they can focus on counter terrorism and get back to the business of governing
5581015 i just dont think that one person especially given the condition he has been operating in for some time makes that much difference
5581016 that is an opportunity not a liability but it comes at a difficult time
5581017 strengthened its safe haven in pakistans federally administered tribal areas by deepening its alliances with pakistani militants
5581018 things are not going to get better theyre going to get worse
5581019 i dont know if the new regime will show the same resolve
5581020 health care pollution those are the things that they are concerned about many people feel that regardless of who is in power their lives are not going to be improved
5581021 this is a pizza place not the military i will do the work and i will do it right but you need to lighten up
5581022 were not worried about it weve seen this movie before
5581023 there are bad storms and there are nice ones and this is a nice one
5581024 it cleans out all the trees it gives people a little work to do and it gets the tourists out of here for a few days
5581025 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5581026 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5581027 ive got a generator and ive got a concrete home that i built myself so i know it can withstand this
5581028 every hurricane that we have we have additional lessons learned and experience
5581029 this is a broad really diffuse storm all the florida keys and all the florida peninsula are going to feel the effects of this storm no matter where the center makes landfall
5581030 papa murphys take n bake pizza handmade in our kitchen home baked in your oven
5581031 i am so happy that ian got an olympic medal at last
5581032 congratulations to the canadian team for a job well done and a medal thats well deserved
5581033 i was live streaming this event at work and i started crying when ian went clear
5581034 you know they have a collective memory there that is very important
5581035 it is the second biggest economy in the world in 50 years it will be the biggest economy in the world starting with former prime ministers diefenbaker and then with trudeau and all of us we established very good relations with china
5581036 and suddenly you break a bridge it would have been easy just to be there
5581037 you gotta keep your left arm straight during the golf swing
5581038 its only our tradition and culture that are driving this ban until now
5581039 it was really hard for me to train and to even get to the olympics
5581040 every day every night youre thinking about it scared that something will happen to your family
5581041 the asaish are saying they will annex kirkuk by force and that is terrifying people
5581042 theres a lot of interest but at the same time its danish there are the cartoons
5581043 its not about being blasphemous though its about things that make both sides have a laugh
5581044 but in my view your face is not everything real beauty lies inside a person not outside
5581045 because beauty is all about faces and beautiful girls and skin
5581046 im independent now i stand on my own two feet
5581047 i have a job i work i earn in fact im living on my own which isnt an easy thing to do for a woman in pakistan for a lone woman to survive
5581048 we have not seen any significant russian movement out of georgia today
5581049 if it rolled in after aug 6 it needs to roll out
5581050 i think it is because of the intense training if he had been more relaxed the injury might not have been so bad i have experienced in the past the great pressure that government officials exert on the athletes as well as the coach and that they demand a gold medal otherwise it is meaningless liu xiang is still a young boy and he has been put under a bit too much expectation
5581051 is respected and loved but he leads a really boring life and cannot go out much
5581052 it would be better if he was in an environment that is more like a foreign country with less attention
5581053 very hard it was also one of the best weeks of training that i have ever had i gained a lot of confidence between the half marathon and now the difference between my training before the trials and now has been night and day i feel that i am very ready but that i am also very fresh and i hope that will give me and advantage both physically and mentally over the guys who are over trained and that might have raced very hard marathons earlier in the year
5581054 my mother is probably one of the biggest reasons why im running because she used to run and she stopped because she got pregnant with my big brother
5581055 my mother encourages me a lot and i really love her because when nobody else was there she always made sure to provide for us i ran at primary champs in jamaica barefooted and i really put in a lot of hard work to get to where i am now
5581056 i dont know if i should cry smile or jump i dont know i think this is a fabulous thing for the three of us to win the medals and for jamaica to get one two three its about time weve been waiting for this
5581057 getting up at six in the morning doing an eight hour day then going to the track to do my workouts i did that for a year that was enough i prefer this
5581058 im sure she will break the world record when shes 21 or 22 maybe she runs different a very very fast first lap
5581059 shows in kenya we can do better it shows you are capable more
5581060 the marathon is one event in which you can keep going when youre older i know in london ill have all that support maybe my body will hold out and i could do that
5581061 nobody on the face of the planet wants to win a medal more than i do
5581062 trying to stay in the moment and take it one race at a time
5581063 osaka is long behind me what happened last year was last year this is a whole new year
5581064 we will put our teams against the best in the world year in and year out
5581065 sports get measured by two things the quality of the performance and who witnesses it
5581066 we have an understandable sport we have an attractive sport we have a sport that everybody has played its our job to take that advantage and look at the modern landscape of what it takes to sell it and to see that were selling to a generation that has short attention spans
5581067 some drugs are quite difficult to get hold of but this one suddenly became much easier to buy and i guess thats why were seeing more positive tests
5581068 are more difficult than the olympics it is more difficult to be part of the u s team than to win a gold medal here
5581069 you cant put a limit on anything the more you dream the farther you get
5581070 i got phone calls im sure bob did not just from the administration from congress saying we dont want this possibly probably shit we want to know whats your best judgment whats your bottom line and the nie fell into that trap the famous sentence iraq has biological and chemical weapons we didnt know that we didnt know that we believed it im not saying it was a lie theres a big difference between we believe that and iraq has why are we talking this way my answer to that is we were under a lot of pressure to dispense with the qualifiers and say is it black or is it white
5581071 the position of u s leaders is that they were told by intelligence officials that their assertions in both areas were sound and that there was no evidence to the contrary in short it was an intelligence failure by those who served the president and vice president
5581072 in months leading up to the war cia officials tried to get access to the iraqi but they were blocked by the germans who were following wippls advice
5581073 sabris account was relayed to tenet who delivered it personally to bush the following day but the administration quickly lost interest in sabri when it heard what he had to say bush dismissed the intelligence as disinformation and the white house said it would be interested in sabri only if he chose to defect
5581074 o beautiful for patriot dream that sees beyond the years thine alabaster cities gleam undimmed by human tears america america god shed his grace on thee and crown thy good with brotherhood from sea to shining sea
5581075 sheets of empty canvas untouched sheets of clay were laid spread out before me as her body once did all five horizons revolved around her soul as the earth to the sun now the air i tasted and breathed has taken a turn ooh and all i taught her was everything ooh i know she gave me all that she wore and now my bitter hands chafe beneath the clouds of what was everything oh the pictures have all been washed in black tattooed everything i take a walk outside im surrounded by some kids at play i can feel their laughter so why do i sear oh and twisted thoughts that spin round my head im spinning oh im spinning how quick the sun can drop away and now my bitter hands cradle broken glass of what was everything all the pictures have all been washed in black tattooed everything all the love gone bad turned my world to black tattooed all i see all that i am all ill be i know some day youll have a beautiful life i know youll be a star but why cant it be cant it be mine
5581076 it was one of the few times when i couldnt read his reaction
5581077 i asked about iran and waited i was hoping to get a reaction he just looked at me with this funny blank stare id spent a lot of time with him briefing him and that had never happened
5581078 by not taking action to engage the iranians on at least the al qaeda leadership inside iran weve created a situation where iran now in 2007 ends up being the most likely entity that would secretly be involved in strategic planning against the united states and in a way we allowed iran to facilitate that to end up in this position by not talking to them if theres an incident like a wmd attack on the u s which is definitely a when not an if well track it to where it goes and its quite likely we would track it to iran and then irans toast and were toast its the worst scenario its the world war three scenario
5581079 michael johns the former heritage foundation foreign policy analyst and speechwriter to president george h
5581080 it is my belief many of them are getting a pass when it comes to sensitivity training and psychological evaluations
5581081 theres no real consensus theres no candidate thatll make everybody happy
5581082 depending on where you are from and where your allegiance has been will help determine that
5581083 this has been a great privilege to work on behalf of the people of illinois for over 35 years
5581084 emil jones is a man with a big heart and a man of action he is a true champion of the people
5581085 he didnt just do the talk he did the walk all of us in illinois owe him a great debt of gratitude
5581086 first of all i have taken a county lake county and turned it from bright red to pale blue
5581087 i have probably added more democrats to the senate than anybody else ive shown my ability in that area
5581088 as your paper has reported i had no involvement in it this has nothing to do with me
5581089 i think everyone will admit that hes certainly put his heart and soul into it and had some really impressive results out of it
5581090 i feel good about the year and im very appreciative of the board for recognizing that
5581091 i dont know what would be a bigger reason to opt out than that its more expensive

5581093 look at the preacher he should be punished for what hes doing
5581094 begging your pardon but i thought you were going to punish him
5581095 then nobly give to the whole world this discovery which could contribute so much to the progress of art and science
5581096 what kind of idiot goes around saying theres nothing we can do about the russian troops in georgia
5581097 did ridge say that i didnt hear that myself but no wonder youre mad at him republicans arent supposed to tell the truth it violates their most sacred traditions
5581098 even if everyone knows we cant do anything you dont go around admitting it
5581099 well if everyone knows its not as though he spilled any beans anyway its totally obvious bad foreign policy has stretched us thin and russia is fully aware of it we can whine and complain but thats all we can do
5581100 its not the presidents fault that our troops are in iraq if we hadnt gone in there saddam would still be in power how would you like that
5581101 i wonder if the press is going to ask questions about the foreign agent on mccains campaign staff
5581102 john mccain has a registered foreign agent on his campaign staff his foreign policy advisor has been a paid lobbyist for georgia trying to smooth its way to nato membership i wonder what assurances randy scheunemann has been giving to the president of georgia did he imply to saakashvili that he could count on u s support if he sent troops into south ossetia everyone keeps saying that an emergency in foreign affairs will benefit the mccain campaign even though im not sure i believe that but did scheunemann believe it did he see a chance to start one by encouraging saakashvili to invade south ossetia
5581103 that makes no sense ossetia is part of georgia a country cant invade itself
5581104 i certainly dont want to push the analogy too far mom but do you think the people of the state of georgia would have agreed with you as sherman came marching into atlanta different georgia i know but the point is that saakashvili set this off when he sent troops into the south ossetia province russian troops were already there as peacekeepers because the province has been rebellious in the past a deal was brokered by the international community to calm the situation and russia provided the troops to police the peace agreement thats the apple cart that saakashvili overturned it gave the russians the perfect excuse to move in more troops and take over the province
5581105 russia certainly has invaded georgia mom but the russians didnt really start this the government of georgia did but its complicated im sure the version you saw on fox news is simpler and breaks things down into good guys versus bad guys thats pretty convenient isnt it we should all be grateful for simplified news from fox

5581109 you spoke so beautifully you have to make this a reality otherwise it will remain a speech
5581110 i get to shift economies its extremely liberating i breathe differently
5581111 its never a full implementation it is easier to dream than to do
5581112 in america and australia it has to be outside the car
5581113 she pulls in then shes squeezing between two cars to drag out this big cable and walk it back to her car shell be wearing her nice work clothes and getting them dirty
5581114 weve just lost half the market you need to make life simple for people
5581115 but at the end what you want is a snowflake
5581116 what do we need to make this happen two servos two degrees of movement for the arm
5581117 this is the driver experience he goes into a spot and the spot connects itself in 2008 we put the cable in the unit in 2010 we use an arm in 2012 theres a smart arm that connects automatically for the home unit the users get a pull cable for free or they pay 500 and they get autoconnect itll cost 250 to build and well sell it for 500
5581118 by the time hes thought of something to him its been completed its been achieved
5581119 the other trait is that by the time youve understood what hes thinking hes already somewhere else youre in catch up mode 24 7
5581120 in order to bring about this dramatic change sometimes we need a boy like in the fairy tales to say look the emperor has no clothes we can all see that for ourselves so how come we havent said so and this boy comes along and puts things in motion to bring about change and the boy in this story and he really is a boy practically but he has achieved more than many adults have is of course shai agassi
5581121 when you want a fish you get a woman and when you want a woman you get a fish
5581122 he had the self image of being an equal to steve jobs or michael dell or bill gates
5581123 even if this ends up destroying for lack of a better word my refinery business that will be small money compared to what this will be when you play chess you give up something to get something else
5581124 we wouldnt have invested if we thought this was a onetime one place story
5581125 you dont have the normal car problem where you need first gear to get off the line we just took the original transmission and stuck it permanently in second
5581126 when you take your foot off the pedal the car has kinetic energy
5581127 the motor starts charging the battery turning the kinetic energy back to electric energy
5581128 if youre regening it means you used too much energy in the first place
5581129 ah you are not a computer its not like you can calculate how much energy you need to get to that red light
5581130 every time you do regen theres a not like you get it all back
5581131 the perfect driver would cruise around without ever using regen or the brakes when they came to their destination they would coast to a stop
5581132 zero percent tax on our cars dong as a partner
5581133 but there was already 0 percent tax on alternative energy cars in denmark
5581134 ill be offering 20 000 cars in a market where youre selling 60 000 cars how many have you planned to sell in 2011 in denmark because i recommend you take them off your plan
5581135 i have a strong feeling this is where the industry is going to go
5581136 we are not aware of any reason why automakers would not sign up for this
5581137 i have so many sins to pay on my climate bill right now that we hope this works really fast
5581138 we separated the ownership of the car and the ownership of the battery see car companies dont know how to assess the life of the battery so they go through these complicated programs of testing them for a long period of time and we told the car company you know what just like you dont sell a car with a card that says here is oil for the life of the car you dont sell cars with the batteries for the life of the car because the battery is crude oil
5581139 if we also buy clean generation we reduce the price of clean electrons so that at the end of 10 years clean electrons are cheaper than coal based electrons and nobody builds another coal plant at that point thats another 40 percent of co 2 emissions thats the treaty tony blair is now working to get for the world by 2050 im telling you we can get there a decade after we finish the car side we can get there in 2030 60 percent reduction in our co 2 emissions
5581140 i joke that 29 days a month shais my boss and one day a month
5581141 will transfer 2 trillion to 3 trillion out of the economy
5581142 we dont make batteries so arent we going to swap out foreign oil dependence for foreign battery reliance
5581143 all you need is a plug right why would you need an infrastructure
5581144 my proposal was about health care or something in san francisco
5581145 this is the irony the city is working harder to get their business than the business itself shouldnt he be sucking up to san francisco
5581146 our mission is to break the worlds oil addiction before it breaks us
5581147 were not its not us to them its them to us you see people want this to happen we just happen to be in the way of their getting what they want we cant give them the car fast enough thats something we need to capture were here to serve you not were here to sell to you were a facilitator not the creator this is going to be a community we just need to get out of their way theyre going to push for policy theyre going to sell the cars theyre going to be zealots
5581148 he tells you the story and it sounds so simple why dont we have it today why isnt it here already

5581151 these people are idiots we are trying to reduce the number of truck crashes in the area and someone goes and does this to a vital piece of equipment designed to help save lives
5581152 at least we can access the animals and we are saving them
5581153 we want to get word out to massage therapists to promote standards there are 54 massage therapists in blenheim and only six to 12 come to our massage meetings
5581154 were hoping to get registration for massage therapists similar to what nurses and physios have to go through they must do so many hours of learning and professional development per year and they can do that by attending our conferences and meetings
5581155 the other aim would be getting registered with acc so patients can be referred to us at the moment patients have to pay wed like to have the same status as osteopaths and chiropractors
5581156 when does a certain type of living arrangement become commercial in law and practically what are the differences in effects between the various forms of activities from a resource management point of view
5581157 with perhaps an evaluation of its role under the local government act
5581158 but incidents like that are normally reported very quickly safety systems rely on the information flow

5581161 clearly the broadcasters will do or say anything so as not to pay artists for their work we welcome a full and open debate before congress on ending the unfair free ride given over the air radio and the granting to artists the long overdue right to be paid for their recordings when they are played

5581170 a couple from kafr yasif in the galilee received the shock of their lives monday when the wifes miscarried 610 gram fetus which had been declared dead five hours earlier was found to be breathing
5581171 we had a baby weighing only 580 grams and she survived
5581172 when we unwrapped the baby to see her she realized it was moving i began screaming and ran with it toward the doctors
5581173 but it wasnt viable it had no right to live
5581174 we have heard about suicide bombers on foot they are receiving indirect fire
5581175 cant be a crime because heavenly father is the one that tells warren when a girl is ready to get married

5581185 chronic pancreatitis is like a death sentence and theres a lot of stuff i still want to do
5581186 im a little skeptical because in animal models nothing worked as well as the liver
5581187 but its important to try lots of sites so we have data about exactly what the best options are
5581188 shaking a tree then separating the fruit from the leaves and branches
5581189 just about islet cell transplantation theres a lot to learn
5581190 what are the optimal ways to grow islets how can we create a different kind of pancreas in someones arm what are the advantages and disadvantages
5581191 but as we work out these questions in the next few years
5581192 were going to be a lot closer to routinely preventing diabetes in patients having their pancreas removed then in the next decade i hope we can close in on cloned islets that can treat or even cure diabetes
5581193 her mom called me this morning and said thank you
5581194 it made me happier knowing i saved a kid and helped a kid into adulthood
5581195 i have never heard him holler like that so i knew he was in pain
5581196 at that point i was able to wake up and realize that this was not a movie this was not a dream is this really happening
5581197 i turned on the light and they were on the floor
5581198 he was bleeding profusely he had a knife sticking out of his head right behind his left ear sticking out
5581199 im not going to jail i will kill you both before i go to jail
5581200 she munoz said to him you werent supposed to wake up
5581201 she kept struggling so i hit her with the bat
5581202 she stopped for a minute and then she started struggling again and i told her again im going to hit you again if you dont stop
5581203 she is a disgruntled subcontractor that stole a bunch of equipment from him he filed charges on her so there is a warrant out on her she is retaliating
5581204 we are very blessed and thankful because when he left the house on that stretcher i didnt know if he was coming home
5581205 it is our hope to increase awareness about cardiac deaths and encourage everyone to learn how to save a life
5581206 you go through the training in hopes you dont ever have to use it
5581207 the goal we have always had is to try and create a community where people can live work play and be educated and do all of those things within that community
5581208 it is going to bring so much to sugar land more than just another retail shopping center or just another restaurant
5581209 you are not talking about reliant stadium with 70 000 people
5581210 what we saw was a tremendous entertainment value for the community
5581211 that is what we call our entertainment district they are all together all in one place
5581212 if you use it you pay for it if you dont use it you dont pay for it
5581213 by far the majority of the people i have spoken with have shown enthusiasm particularly for the indoor concert hall entertainment and the ball park
5581214 she looks like your typical soccer mom shes a very nice quiet neighbor
5581215 it makes me wonder if we ought to pay our teachers more
5581216 we climbed up a pretty steep route to begin with
5581217 it just really smashed the plane theres not much left just the engine and the tip of the tail
5581218 but im glad i found the wreckage because the family will know whats going on
5581219 it was a lucky break that the hiker just happened to spot it when he did

5581445 suffice it to say the state produced overwhelming evidence at the guilt phase of the trial establishing that hankins killed his wife and her two children there was also evidence that hankins engaged in sexual activity with and around the dead bodies
5581446 we have reason to believe that they have been involved in a series of recent robberies including at least one other shooting where the victim survived
5581447 all the robberies that were looking at appear to have random victims
5581448 had information that there was a white car involved in several robberies prior to this shooting so his attention was drawn to this white car
5581449 he gave some additional information that led us to believe munoz and the juvenile were involved in some robberies in that vehicle
5581450 but jurors tend to look at people like serial killers and people who kidnap and sexually assault children as more deserving of the death penalty
5581451 we certainly thought the nature of the crime and the criminality of this defendant was deserving of the death penalty
5581452 but the jury heard the evidence and they believed that a life sentence was appropriate in this case
5581453 the defense would like you to think this was botched crime but it wasnt
5581454 after the shooting jeff dodson is looking out the door and heres where the real callousness comes he grabs a beer and walks out the door thats what gaurab rajbanshis life was worth

5581485 it used to be that individuals developed type 2 diabetes in their 50s and 60s but now its reaching them in their 20s and 30s

5581487 if the mom has diabetes of any kind and she gets pregnant the child has a high risk of becoming obese and insulin resistant at an early age
5581488 its like a ticking time bomb for young adults these are people in their reproductive years so its a vicious cycle
5581489 this whole diabetes thing is very scary from a health economic view
5581490 people with diabetes account for about 20 percent of healthcare spending because diabetes is so expensive and the numbers are increasing so rapidly it really threatens the health of our economic system
5581491 because people with diabetes are not going to be productive employees
5581492 i think were going to be seeing increasing rates of type 2 diabetes on the south and west sides

5581504 no states attorney wanted to try it because it was a loser but it was a catch 22 because they didnt want to drop it they knew if they dropped it were going to sue the city of chicago

5581550 the difference is last year we said its early and in due time well get it together and it just kept happening through the season
5581551 this year we cant start that way we have to hammer it right away and i think thats what weve done
5581552 its mostly players buying into a system and making sure they understand how they fit and how important it is to stop the run

5581590 its a crazy process in my opinion i dont want to have the additional costs of lobbying the legislature
5581591 that way is too complicated and expensive in my mind
5581592 i cant say that im frustrated with the opposition because the fact that theyre able to participate in the process is a good thing
5581593 the msba has strongly directed us to look at whitman hanson as the preferred model

5581609 maar dat was niet zo erg omdat alles dicht bij elkaar zat in het fietsen was ik wel echt goed toen we weg waren met drie wilde de mexicaan niet meer overnemen en ik had met dirk bockel afgesproken om hem los te rijden op de klim ik trok echter iets te hard door waardoor ook dirk moest lossen maar ik heb gewacht omdat ik het laatste stuk niet alleen wou rijden natuurlijk had ik op meer voorsprong gehoopt maar voor de wedstrijd had ik zeker getekend voor die kleine minuut het is namelijk een beetje loterij wie kan wegrijden kijk maar naar peter croes
5581610 ik ben echt verrast over mijn looponderdeel ik heb mijn wedstrijd goed ingedeeld en loop in de tweede helft nog ongeveer even snel als in de eerste daardoor kon ik nog wat mensen inlopen ongelofelijk dat ik na een ronde in het lopen op kop lig op de olympische spelen ik wilde absoluut dirk voorbij op het einde van de eerste ronde zodat ik op kop voorbij de tribunes kon passeren nu gaan we hier nog een dag of zes feesten en peking en dan is mijn eerste wedstrijd de zwintriatlon in knokke op 3 september
5581611 ik ben echt niet tevreden mijn zwemmen en fietsen waren meer dan goed maar het lopen was zeer slecht begin dit jaar liep ik in hetzelfde veld anderhalve minuut sneller ik heb de laatste weken aan overdaad gedaan het schema was nochtans perfect maar de fout ligt bij mij in de fietsproef ben ik een beetje op kousenvoeten weggereden maar toen ik zag dat ik alleen zat had ik door dat het geen zin had en heb ik eens goed gevloekt na het fietsen wilde ik nog gaan voor een top 16 of zelfs een top 8 al zou dat wel heel moeilijk geweest zijn ik ben wat rustiger vertrokken dan normaal in het lopen maar ben er eigenlijk nooit ingekomen

5581614 i thought it was an interesting tactic harvey told 6pr
5581615 i dont think he warnock has been affected by what appears to be an ambush
5581616 robbies a required player and in the end that will be his decision about what he wants to do harvey said
5581617 id love him to stay i think hes got some good scope and id love to work with him over the next couple of years
5581618 he probably understands hes still evolving as a player and hes probably going to play with a guy sandilands that hopefully asserts himself into a dominant ruckman for a period of time
5581619 and robbie can play along with that for many years to come and thats the striking thing that he should be looking forward to at this stage
5581620 it will be great if he does but at the end of the day its up to him and well just see what happens
5581621 hes very important hes a great player to have around the club a great person and a great football player

5581653 another one hit the front of the plate and skipped the last one hit me in the neck
5581654 i was hoping i wouldnt pass out before the inning ended and i got to the dugout

5581677 harga seribu rupiah per kilo yang ditawarkan perhutani tidak nyucuk jadinya kami tidak mau memanen biarkan saja tanamannya mati rugi mas
5581678 kalau harganya dua ribu ke atas per kilo baru bisa menguntungkan petani
5581679 harga tersebut sudah sesuai kesepakatan sebelum program digulirkan tapi petani yang tak mau memanen meskipun berkali kali kita minta padahal kualitas tanaman dan panenannya bagus
5581680 dad bought it for me on the weekend we went out to that new place that opened up out by the power centre
5581681 is there anything the matter aurora youve been distracted all morning
5581682 look if anything is the matter you can always talk to me
5581683 why do you want to throw my coat into a lake
5581684 your want to grab my coat and toss it into a lake
5581685 you hate that i have a new coat and youre in an old one
5581686 it doesnt matter youve been jealous the whole time weve been together thinking all those things behind my back
5581687 yeah sure i wanted the things you had but that didnt mean i didnt like you it was just a dream that wasnt the only thing i thought about you i still liked you until now you traitor
5581688 its not how well jump over the obstacles nor how fast you get on the top but how often you stop and appreciate the simple things in life which makes life worthwhile
5581689 its just tough getting used to the knee brace i hate wearing this thing
5581690 any time you feel a pop in your knee its happened a couple times its like aw shoot
5581691 that was about as good a pick as youre gonna see
5581692 i just want him involved in practice and i think theres a little something he can bring to z
5581693 so i want him to have a little taste of that position but he is a quarterback and you can see in everything he does individually all of his fundamental drills his meeting time is all spent at the quarterback position
5581694 nick charles is a fish out of water but hes one of those guys that loves football so hes happy as a pig in slop
5581695 wir verbessern das system organisch damit einher geht auch dass die plattform schrittweise stabiler wird
5581696 wir berlegen derzeit ob wir mit unserer entwicklung f r twitter weitermachen sollen
5581697 ich denke die firma unternimmt die richtigen schritte und geht dabei auch sinnvollerweise vorsichtig vor
5581698 das gesamte existierende system komponente f r komponente ausgetauscht werden mit einer software die vollst ndig neu entwickelt wird
5581699 doch wir experimentieren mit unterschiedlichen ans tzen bereits jetzt haben wir uns in einigen bereichen weit von der alten datenbank entfernt
5581700 die sind f r uns von unsch tzbarem wert was unsere bem hungen um eine bessere verl sslichkeit und stabilit t anbetrifft
5581701 twitter kontrolliert das produkt nicht die leute die es benutzen kontrollieren es die frage ist nicht wie man einen microblogging dienst theoretisch skalieren kann die frage ist wie man einen microblogging dienst auf das ma skalieren kann wie es die twitter nutzer brauchen
5581702 das k nnen wir erreichen in dem wir all die kleinen teile identifizieren die das ganze bilden
5581703 ich stelle mir einen schwarm von v geln vor die sich um ein objekt bewegen und von einer sekunde auf die andere ihre flugrichtung wechseln
5581704 tidak wajar mempolitikkan isu sebegini dan pihak pihak tertentu yang menggunakan nama islam dan syariah untuk kepentingan tertentu harus berhenti sama sekali dari berbuat demikian
5581705 pum pp juga menyatakan bahawa pendakwa saiful tidak ada keperluan untuk melafazkan sumpah memandangkan beliau adalah di pihak yang membuat pertuduhan
5581706 dalam syariat islam kes ini diklasifikasikan sebagai kes hudud dalam bab zina dan pendakwa wajar membawa bukti mengikut syarak bahawa perlakuan liwat berlaku dan perkara ini akan dibicarakan di mahkamah selaras kaedah feqah
5581707 perkara yang berlaku ini akan memberi kesan buruk antara lain kepada perlaksanaan sistem kehakiman syariah di malaysia apabila pada masa akan datang pelbagai pihak boleh menggunakan ini sebagai
5581708 proses pembuktian dan pengadilan akan diketepikan dan pihak yang bersalah boleh memilih untuk menggunakan sumpah yang tidak memerlukan pembuktian bagi menyelamatkan diri dari penghukuman
5581709 pumpp juga menyeru agar beberapa ulamak dan agamawan untuk merujuk dan menerima pandangan ulamak dan pakar lain sebelum membuat apa apa kenyataan yang bakal memburukkan keadaan dan tidak memungkinkan proses keadilan dan penghakiman dapat dilaksanakan dengan sempurna di negara ini
5581710 dalam hal ini dan apa juga masalah semua pihak digesa untuk merujuk kepada prinsip taawun seperti mana yang ditekan oleh al quran
5581711 they are playing around with and harming the islamic area
5581712 do not waste time and cause hardships for children and women in the sahara without need
5581713 we often discuss satire the sort of thing he does and to a certain extent i do as distillery
5581714 you have an enormous amount of material and you have to distill it to a syrup by the end of the day so much of it is a hewing process chipping away at things that arent the point or arent the story or arent the intention really its that last couple of drops youre distilling that makes all the difference it isnt that hard to get a ton of corn into a gallon of sour mash but to get that gallon of sour mash down to that one shot of pure whiskey takes patience
5581715 it was one of those nights when i wore a super tight dress that you couldnt have worn anything under since it would have showed the paparazzi were literally lowering their cameras like speculums when i got out of the car
5581716 on the way home i said to my husband len wiseman darling i think they might have gotten it and so when we pulled in at home i made him re enact the thing with his camera a sort of crime scene run through it appears i survived unscathed
5581717 ive always played football on the edge i thought i had to live like i played i was immature i dont have to be a wild and crazy guy i still love laughing im not going to do something if i cant have fun but now when i go out i can drink an odouls non alcoholic beer or something and ive got my girlfriend jordan so im not chasing women anymore im a homebody
5581718 but it was awfully funny god only knows what its going to be like when he really starts to feel comfortable
5581719 i wont shave until after camp my goal is to get it to where people will feel uncomfortable being around me the parents wont want their kids to take a picture with me women dont want to be alone around me
5581720 whats the first thing i told you when i got off the plane
5581721 they saw the changes in me they knew the man i had become and how ive grown but they still wanted to throw that back in my face hes still a risk that made me mad because heres your guy and youre seeing it first hand have my back they didnt do that
5581722 and hes a good football player but after that second one were not in a mood to do a long term contract
5581723 you have to sit down and talk to them get a good feel for them you just have to have that feeling that the persons right for the team as soon as we met jared we knew that
5581724 when you have a guy of his caliber available and its a very rare situation that you have that we jumped on the opportunity
5581725 we want to win championships i just had a good feeling
5581726 i needed to see what was going on with me
5581727 did i have a problem the main thing was that i was making bad decisions
5581728 whatever people think of me now thats what they think
5581729 i know where im at thats what i conveyed to them you guys dont know me i understand that youve got to ask questions but heres where im at the only way youre going to get to know me is to be around me i think they respected that
5581730 i hope he never takes another drink in his life
5581731 in the end we gave him what he wanted he got his freedom and he got himself the biggest contract ever for a defensive player in the history of the game
5581732 you think thats not going to happen to me because youre dense
5581733 your talent on the field might get you a second chance but what you do off the field is whats going to get you through your career
5581734 keep making mistakes and eventually people are going to get tired of it
5581735 he plays the run equally well for a 270 pound guy that speaks value hes not like former tampa bay buccaneers de simeon rice who you had to back up with a safety all the time and hes an all day sucker
5581736 youre a little concerned when you put a new guy in a group with some dominant players
5581737 but hes come and fit right in i wish the season started tomorrow just to toot the horn and kick the tires
5581738 guess thats the advantage of being short so i owed him one
5581739 in our room youve got to have thick skin so far hes been rolling with it
5581740 ive hit him so many times and thought i had him last year
5581741 i dont know how he got rid of that ball thats one thing on my list hes a good guy but because hes upper echelon it drives me so much more to put him on his back
5581742 instability and clear desire to wage war on democracies illustrates the need to increase nasas funding and close the gap
5581743 im just glad theyre willing to let the past be the past and give him a chance i just hope that the cincinnati fans will give him the same type of chance
5581744 if we have a situation where we can sell out a game with the eighth selection from the big 12 against a conference usa team or navy just imagine what we can do if we have two top 10 teams playing each other every year
5581745 twitter said that it simply cant afford to support long distance sms twittering anymore and the company claims
5581746 i cant talk to my children cant play with them cant clasp my arms around their smooth bodies but i am happy for them because they live smile laugh that means a fine day to me
5581747 that after i drink this bubbling concoctioun i will magically transform into an a hole
5581748 its the radiocarbon date that to our minds is like a square peg in a round hole its not fitting properly and the question is why
5581749 there is a lot of other evidence that suggests too many that the shroud is older than the radiocarbon dates allow and so further research is certainly needed
5581750 only by doing this will people be able to arrive at a coherent history of the shroud which takes into account and explains all of the available scientific and historical information
5581751 hes had other ideas but theyve all been shot down and this one will be shot down too
5581752 to do this we will save and close your project and open windows dvd maker
5581753 dave we have to do our presentation first because theres lollipops and if we dont do ours today ill eat them all
5581754 group one is going to go first because its logical
5581755 okay so the first thing like on the board is alliteration think of a sentence using as many words as you want as long as five of them begin with the same letter
5581756 holy blonde i saw you yesterday and i thought it was you because the clothes were right but the hair wasnt yours but it is yours
5581757 the only reason why we dont have enough food for you too is because you insist on eating only the crusts and not your full share of the bread if you ate as much bread as you need we would have enough for both of us

5581765 we have heard about suicide bombers on foot they are receiving
5581766 according to our reports about 30 taliban tried to attack the salerno base they were fired at we have found six bodies which were all wearing suicide vests
5581767 some of them have blown themselves up others are hiding in nearby houses and corn fields the troops are searching for them

5581774 wait this is wrong theres another way to go about my life
5581775 the market looks weak i still do not see any serious buying at these levels
5581776 unfortunately the labor party cant even agree to dig uranium out of the ground and sell it to the rest of the world he said
5581777 weve had the labor party and prime minister kevin rudd for some ridiculously stupid reason refusing to sell uranium to india to help its domestic nuclear power industry
5581778 my view is we will need both sides of politics thats the labor the liberal and national parties to jointly support the development of a nuclear power industry
5581779 we need more rational discussion about nuclear power in australia and much less of the emotive political debate weve had in the last few years
5581780 unfortunately the labor party can amp squo t even agree to dig uranium out of the ground and sell it to the rest of the world amp squo amp squo he said
5581781 in between the police strike force piccadilly and ourselves we basically made atms too hard a target and not a profitable target to attack mr gould said
5581782 weve had a number of them attacked and the thieves have abandoned their attack quite quickly once theyve realised theyve been beaten
5581783 when the problem was occurring the clients wanted to have it not too public until they got some of them out in the field and started defeating these ram raiders mr gould said
5581784 did you see that the way that guy cut him off
5581785 he is on his way to ho chi minh city
5581786 he doesnt want to go back to the uk because hes had so many troubles there already
5581787 he wanted to go to another country like singapore or hong kong
5581788 we messed around with some settings in practice and qualifying but we ended up going back to what we knew for the race
5581789 as for tino fortunately hes fine he came off the top and hit the deck hard but bounced right back up its a shame because he was quick i know he is disappointed but hell come back strong in atlanta tino has a lot of fight in him and hes always trying to do his best
5581790 weve got two more rounds at tracks we both go very well at pietris form has been great and i was riding really well before i got hurt weve had a bout of bad luck but were going to come back strong we look forward to a few more top fives for the team before the end of the season which would be a dream way to end the year
5581791 early in the race we were concerned about front tire wear and couldnt run a full fuel load on the tires so we changed our strategy to add another stop
5581792 that meant we needed to make up the gap with a faster pace and we were able to do it
5581793 we were pleased to extend our podium streak to eight straight in the gst class
5581794 having walt on the team with us was beneficial in developing our setup for topeka and he will ride for us again at the new jersey round in two weeks this is the home stretch and every point is critical in our chase for the championship
5581795 it was a good race for us it was a little bit cooler today and my rockstar makita suzuki crew made a few changes to the gsx r1000 that let me know that i could run a consistent pace i tried to set a fast pace and pull away and i was able to do that vir is a place that ive been able to win reasonably comfortably its a traditional road course and its got a little bit of everything i enjoy riding here right now winning races is my priority and my goal and if i can win a couple more races in atlanta that would be fantastic
5581796 were doing everything we can out there and were riding as hard as possible on the rockstar makita suzuki gsx r1000 thanks to my team for giving me a completely different motorcycle to race today though we just didnt quite have enough for mat today but well keep on riding as hard as we can every weekend even though we didnt get the win hats off to my team mates for a great race and going one two three for rockstar makita suzuki
5581797 ive really gotten my starts figured out in the last few weeks and thats made a big difference for me it was a less exciting race for the fans but i enjoyed being up there with my rockstar makita suzuki team mates in first second and third my team mates are the best riders by far out here in my opinion and we are on the best bikes as well its nice to have some momentum to finish off the season with and my goal is to be back up on the podium and keep the momentum going
5581798 the short version of the story is they didnt want to quit their partying
5581799 if you put this in the class of wedding receptions gone bad i guess this would take the cake
5581800 while it has been a very difficult week i believe the end result is a very positive step forward for the galaxy
5581801 bruce is the best coach for the galaxy and certainly one of the best coaches in the history of the league
5581802 my ultimate goal is to win championships and build a club that all of our fans will be proud of
5581803 were not worried about it weve seen this movie before
5581804 there are bad storms and there are nice ones and this is a nice one
5581805 it cleans out all the trees it gives people a little work to do and it gets the tourists out of here for a few days
5581806 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5581807 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5581808 ive got a generator and ive got a concrete home that i built myself so i know it can withstand this
5581809 every hurricane that we have we have additional lessons learned and experience
5581810 this is a broad really diffuse storm all the florida keys and all the florida peninsula are going to feel the effects of this storm no matter where the center makes landfall

5581814 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers
5581815 if the fact that they were showing up on problem lists for a year doesnt make them high risk i dont know what does
5581816 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
5581817 somebody could have picked up a box and looked at peppers if they wanted to but im not sure that would have been a high priority
5581818 it would require a big leap to think that salmonella in dried peppers could be related to problems in fresh chilies

5581827 your evil spawn angelina jolie and her vacuous hubby brad pitt make about 40 million a year in violent psychopathic movies and give away three of it to starving children trying to look as if they give a crap about humanity as they spit out more dunces that will consume more than their fair share and wreck the earth even more
5581828 miss jolie says she likes john mccain too and hasnt decided who to endorse huh arent you supposed to be somewhat enlightened or do you not know that the african daughter you hold in every picture had parents who suffered and died because of the republican partys worldwide economic assault on africa over the last few decades since reagan

5581940 our music is anything but instant but it has an identity and character of its own
5581941 as christians i think we tend to add churchy stuff to what christianity is supposed to be like we say christians are supposed to look talk dress and eat and drink this way and the bible just doesnt have that stuff
5581942 we mars hill keep a little bit of a raw edge to us we keep it simple without any human man made stuff were not the churchiest of folks were pretty big bible people
5581943 we believe thats a role god has given to men

5581948 it looks like they drove them until they crashed or ran out of gas
5581949 they also stole 19 other sets of keys but they didnt take the vehicles
5581950 it would cost us between 200 and 400 to re key some of the expensive cars
5581951 they took the radiator a c fuel pump and most of the engine from one car
5581952 i can tell you with all confidence it wont be green

5581959 momma i know exactly why were having this cool spell of weather
5581960 well because on cool days it means we are moving closer to pluto
5581961 i cant remember which president was president during the civil war you know the one that wanted to end slavery wasnt it james monroe
5581962 we thought it may not seam or swing that much
5581963 as the breeze was strong we expected it to swing throughout the day which it did but i also think there was a fair bit of movement in the surface at the start
5581964 there is a bit of russian in all of us
5581965 we want every floridian and guest to be a survivor i know this is only a tropical storm but we take it seriously
5581966 the flood threats particularly for our urban areas will continue for much of the week
5581967 there are a lot of ways people can lose their lives in a storm and we need their help to keep the loss of lives down
5581968 be smart be safe there are a lot of people working hard to keep floridians safe
5581969 people are remembering previous storms that have come through florida and it brings back bad memories

5581972 no permitiremos que rusia dibuje una nueva l nea de separaci n en los estados que a n no est n integrados en la estructura transatl ntica como georgia y ucrania
5581973 tenemos que rechazar los objetivos estrat gicos de rusia que estaban claramente encaminados a socavar la democracia de georgia a usar su capacidad militar para da ar y en algunos casos destruir las infraestructuras y a debilitar el estado georgiano
5581974 rusia no puede tener las dos cosas no puede actuar como lo hizo en la guerra fr a y esperar que se le trate como un socio responsable al mismo tiempo
5581975 es un estado que desafortunadamente usa el instrumento que siempre ha utilizado que es la fuerza militar
5581976 si rusia quiere hacer una elecci n estrat gica diferente eso es un mal comienzo
5581977 esto es un juego muy peligroso y quiz los rusos quieren reconsiderarlo
5581978 nadie necesita aviaci n estrat gica rusa en las costas estadounidenses

5581980 those returning from deployment sometimes have short fuses are irritable and angry they dont want to talk about the situation which is opposite of what they should be doing so they isolate themselves
5581981 the family needs to know some of the feelings the returning spouse has they want things back as they were which is not going to happen
5581982 another thing is that the returning spouse avoids intimacy and the other spouse takes this personally
5581983 there are feelings of shock disbelief excitement impatience anger and despair
5581984 there are anger issues medical and mental needs and we are here to make them aware of the things that are available to them child care is available during the briefing session and they are encouraged to ask questions
5581985 the returning ias are reluctant to admit having a mental problem because they feel a stigma is involved
5581986 i saw little fighting but plenty of ieds improvised explosive device i was looking out for the health of the marines the deployment gave me the opportunity to see a different culture and brought me a new meaning and appreciation for life i look at things differently now
5581987 i had to get adjusted to the kids and they had to get to know me while i was gone my wife developed her own way of dealing with the children and i had to adjust to that
5581988 one of the most important things a family can do to help with the readjustment of the returning soldier sailor or marine is to get as much information as they can about the behaviors they may be confronted with upon return
5581989 some poems dont rhyme and some stories dont have a clear beginning middle and end life is about not knowing having to change taking the moment and making the best of it without knowing whats going to happen next

5581997 a small addition to your shower head can save you time money and water a simple shutoff valve can toggle the water flow off and on without undoing your carefully calibrated mix of hot and cold on the faucet itself
5581998 the trouble were having is that the people we spoke to are unable or unwilling to give us an accurate description of what took place
5581999 thats making it more difficult for us to determine who the shooter is and make an arrest

5582001 stimulate informed and dispassionate public discussion about the presence of alcohol in american culture and to consider policies that will effectively empower young adults age 18 to 20 to make mature decisions about the place of alcohol in their own lives
5582002 on the amethyst initiative website the current drinking age of 21 has caused a
5582003 alcohol education that mandates abstinence as the only legal option has not resulted in significant constructive behavioral change among our students
5582004 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5582005 misrepresenting the science and looking for an easy way out of an inconvenient problem
5582006 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses

5582022 i joined the army for my specifically for my oldest boy so he could go to college
5582023 just being in the army my son now has a better opportunity and more chances to go to college
5582024 i have more chances of getting a loan and he has more chances to be looked at by other schools
5582025 he gets great grades and he is the president of several distinguished organizations in his high school including the national honor society basically he has done the leg work and now im going to do whatever i can to take care of him
5582026 after doing physical training in the morning my body would be all sore
5582027 but once my body got used to it and started to adapt things got better it was just like any other job once you learn your job you get used to it
5582028 sometimes im tired and my motivation gets low but i just do what my son told me to do and that is drink water and drive on
5582029 those guys role out every day and if there communication systems arent working and something happens that can be a bad bad thing it is really important to me to make sure those guys are good to go
5582030 if someone is having trouble with their computer we fix their problems
5582031 communication is pretty much a big part of how people in the brigade operate
5582032 people get on their computers and check their emails it is how 90 percent of them do their work its how work gets done in my opinion
5582033 without communication technicians we would have to send up smoke signals to communicate
5582034 if missions are going on or things happen our work day could be extended it is really just one of those things that are up in the air
5582035 if there is something that really needs to be done the team comes together and we do our job
5582036 we work together side by side on a daily basis and we look after each other
5582037 im here to do my part for my country but mostly im here for my family that is my main goal i will not let anything deter me depress me or get in the way of me taking care of my thats it plain and simple
5582038 my family is the backbone and i am going to do whatever it takes to make them happy so i cant be stressed because if im stressed then my wife is stressed which makes my kids stressed so it doesnt happen that way
5582039 i talk to my family pretty much on a daily basis
5582040 thanks to the internet and phone services i make it a goal to call them or message them on a daily basis so they know that everything is okay
5582041 he has a lot of life experience to share with soldiers
5582042 he has worked several civilian jobs where he worked as a crew leader and that definitely shows with his leadership abilities performing his job in the army
5582043 he is the hardest working old man ive ever met
5582044 ellis is full of energy focused on the mission and is a great man
5582045 not only would it help my career in being a leader it will help my family the new rank and extra money will help support them and that just means another bill gets paid
5582046 on r and r i sat down with my wife children and parents and we weighed out the goods things and the bad things and i decided that im going to go ahead and stay in the army
5582047 im going to reenlist because my wife and my family feel safer
5582048 they feel like they are going to be okay and i will make whatever sacrifices i need to make to be sure that they feel that way if my being in the army is going to make them feel that way then im staying in
5582049 my signal teammates are why i am so successful but my success also comes from my family whom my motivation relies on them and them alone
5582050 first of all i think about my wife kathleen and my kids chris tobias cara brandon and harley i think about them depending on me and them knowing that i am over here secondly i think about the good people i work with my roommate my shop and everyone here helped me and lastly i think about all the support i get from my parents back home about me being here without them this tour would have been much more difficult
5582051 i started serving in the army so my son had a better opportunity to go to college
5582052 but now me being in the army has given me a sense of pride for my country and a sense that i am accomplishing something greater then myself

5582070 he was a dictator and he had to go he ruled with the blessings of george bush and bush was the first to withdraw when musharraf needed help imagine bush refused to take his call
5582071 this has been the story of general ayub khan general zia ul haq and now general musharraf
5582072 they called him their ally in the war against terror and when the new political dispensation in pakistan went gunning for him the us was totally indifferent
5582073 his was fundamentally an illegitimate regime he ousted nawaz sharif and now nemesis came visiting him he must have no complaints every dictator says he staged a coup for the good of his country
5582074 any muslim ruler whether democratically elected or a dictator always faces the inevitable threat of us betrayal if he sides with them
5582075 they supported musharrafs dictatorship when they needed him they now say they are supporting democracy in pakistan and that is why musharraf had to go it is a logic nobody would buy
5582076 the fact of the matter is that the american government supports nobody but its own vested interests
5582077 he launched military operations against his own people he allowed the americans a free hand in arresting and jailing people of pakistan when they came under their suspicion
5582078 the fact is he used them and they used him and now since they no longer require him they have dumped him
5582079 being a government organisation certain set of procedures have to be followed before placing funds with any agency there have been some procedural delays wfp is not registered in india hence the company would not get income tax benefit under section 80 c
5582080 its a new project and it could take some time a tripartite agreement to be signed between nmdc united nations world food programme and chhattisgarh government is ready
5582081 alone among bush cabinet principals repeatedly pushed against the white house preference for musharraf
5582082 in reality mr musharraf was playing a delicate double game pakistans murky inter service intelligence agency never severed its ties with the taleban and islamabad continued to provide cover for the militants even as they pocketed washingtons millions
5582083 estamos dispuestos a continuar la ayuda lo hicimos el pasado s bado y domingo y seguiremos haci ndolo esta semana
5582084 simple solution is to return the device to the store provider from which it was purchased and demand repair or replacement
5582085 john made a terrible mistake in 2006 the fact that it is a mistake that many others have made before him did not make it any easier for me to hear when he told me what he had done but he did tell me and we began a long and painful process in 2006 a process oddly made somewhat easier with my diagnosis in march of 2007 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
5582086 our family has been through a lot some caused by nature some caused by human weakness and some most recently caused by the desire for sensationalism and profit without any regard for the human consequences none of these has been easy but we have stood with one another through them all although john believes he should stand alone and take the consequences of his action now when the door closes behind him he has his family waiting for him
5582087 2006 date and how it plays a role in the edwards narrative regarding the affair

5582090 what kind of people write and draw these kind of stories
5582091 now i think i should explain a little about myself
5582092 i am 20 years of age in 1986 87 have asian parents and have lived in a small british town all my life the nearest place to get tales of terror is 29 miles away i have 8 0 level 1 a level and two course passes ever since i can remember ive been into drawing and horror
5582093 after leaving school i did a general education through art amp design where i got a distinction pass the only one ever awarded at that college i failed to get into a degree course so i went into a business of my own now i own my own off license beer spirits etc and grocers store with video tapes plenty of horrors and thats after only 1 year so things have turned out well for me
5582094 i have also been into comics all my life horror comics hold a special interest
5582095 so my new years resolution was to get as many pieces of my work as possible published anywhere but hopefully to be able to work in a comic and what could be better than a horror comic i have plenty of spare time on my hands now and the shop runs by itself when im not drawing im dreaming about drawing and have all sorts of crazy ideas swimming about in my head for stories and paintings in my college days i tried my hand at comics strips and found great satisfaction drawing ohhhhs and arrrrrs from admirers you should get your work printed they told me and as there is no real outlet for this style in britain i have written to you
5582096 on the subject of comic art there are one or two things i need to know which i hope you will help me out with 1 are frames drawn as seen or can they be drawn separately and assembled later 2 is lettering done by machine 3 are speech bubbles and captions added on after 4 what page size should i work at i hope you like my work as my ambition is to appear in your pages
5582097 i would like to do my first few stories for you free i hope that makes your mind up for you how much does one get paid for a story anyway if i do get paid it would help buy time and materials for my obsessive hobby any criticisms of my work would also be deeply appreciated
5582098 i have enclosed a small selection of my work to give you some idea of my tastes and styles
5582099 as you can see im really into the zombie an interest which ranges back a year and a half the selection is taken from my many sketchpads which contain other themes as well aliens gangs etc but no superheroes
5582100 i have plenty more ideas with lots of zombies which i feel are slightly lacking in your mag
5582101 all my work is done just for the fun of it and i enjoy it greatly also included are two story roughs nothing on telly and frankensteins early days which i hope are to your tastes and are worthy to appear in print the storylines and art are rough and if you could i would like them to be written more clearly by someone else as i feel my writing lets me down sometimes if you would like to modify or rewrite them please feel free i hope you do take up my offer as i would very much like to work for you and im sure we will both benefit the people who have seen my work feel it to be of very good quality i hope this isnt lost in the photocopies which i have picked for you i eagerly await your reply as this is one of my alltime best wishes
5582102 though i cant use your work yet gurch i can promise you that if when i can you will be paid a proper amount amounts vary but if you pencil and ink one page a day you would make about as much as the man who installed the phones in eclipses new offices
5582103 i noticed gurchs england address and wrote him a letter to encourage him with his art and btw did he happen to have access to a vhs copy of lemora which i was obsessed with and which was unavailable in the us he wrote back and asked if i could suggest anyone to whom he could submit his work included was a gory christmas card hed done i referred him to chas balun who by then i believe id traded a few tapes and the rest is history
5582104 my way of improving on it is to keep it up i just want to keep playing the same consistency

5582109 sensitivity to this belief will promote development of a trusting relationship
5582110 when youre a parent and youre standing over the body of your child who you think is dying you have to have that
5582111 i know that none of us are immune from anything
5582112 you cant say thats nonsense you have to respect that
5582113 its not that you dont want a miracle to happen its just that is not going to happen today with this patient
5582114 the mom was playing religious tapes in the room and obviously was very focused on looking for a miracle

5582117 one can make the safe assumption that coconut water too would have anti viral components
5582118 there was no such thing as a cure once in the system the virus will be there it will come out when the time is right so it comes down to controlling it coconut water will help in controlling or suppressing the virus

5582123 a lot of our exports go actually to america both commodity export but even more importantly our services they import and these have slackened
5582124 there are some indications clear indications that the american growth slack would hit india too and you know our growth rate has come down a bit and we have to see how much further it comes down
5582125 on the other hand we are not thoroughly dependent on it we should try to see what we can do to overcome that
5582126 i have never been a crystal gazer well i think it goes away in less than two or three years i will be very surprised if it goes on for more than four five years
5582127 if you want to make democracy work you have to make sure that not only the government but the opposition also concentrates on identified major issues
5582128 the growth is a non thought growth is not a formula
5582129 so the issue of democracy is quite central to issue of growth
5582130 this puts a lot of money in government hand so the question is what its priority should be

5582133 as the dust settles from the breakdown of the wto negotiations in geneva some parties are recognising that there was a good package of results left on the table zoellick said
5582134 it would be a mistake for the world economy and harmful for developing countries not to retrieve it
5582135 given the high food prices around the world and the need for poor people to lower their cost of food it just does not make sense for the doha negotiations to founder upon this barrier
5582136 since the purpose of a safeguard is to help cushion the effect of a significant increase in imports on local producers an acceptable justification for the safeguard could require examination of factors in addition to increased trade flows
5582137 a big problem with safeguards is that once a country triggers them it can take two years or more to challenge the grounds for imposing them he said
5582138 in the meantime the new barriers block trade so a compromise could create a speedy due process for challenges without appeal
5582139 it may be understandable that tired negotiators couldnt assemble these and perhaps other variables in a way to solve the problem zoellick said

5582142 i felt like i was soaring on wings like eagles
5582143 i thought theyd actually come back even more im surprised that the top four or five guys stayed out there and kept plugging along it was so warm and so hot and on this blue tarp its really warm
5582144 i was right where i wanted to be i was top five coming in off the bike i started the run well a lot of guys came back to me i just kept on picking them off i did all i could thats all i had
5582145 i still have a little ways to go on the bike
5582146 i made huge huge gains in the swim and my run is exactly where i want it
5582147 i cant explain why i felt so bad out there today i struggled all day
5582148 the u s is not out of the woods i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps i would even go further to say the worst is to come
5582149 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
5582150 we have to see more consolidation in the financial sector before this is over
5582151 probably fannie mae and freddie mac despite what u s treasury secretary hank paulson said these giant mortgage guarantee agencies are not going to exist in their present form in a few years
5582152 there was this view early on in the crisis that sovereign wealth funds could save everybody investment banks did something stupid they lost money in the sub prime theyre great buys sovereign wealth funds come in and make a lot of money by buying them
5582153 that view neglects the point that the financial system has become very bloated in size and needed to shrink
5582154 cutting interest rates is going to lead to a lot of inflation in the next few years in the united states
5582155 suppose i never ever met you suppose we never fell in love suppose i never ever let you kiss me so sweet and so soft

5582188 its getting harder and harder to believe that these cells are immunoprivileged
5582189 in fact the rejection of these cells confirms our suspicions that they do cause an immune response
5582190 we all want to know whats going to happen if you transplant these stem cells into a person
5582191 based on these results we believe that transplanting these cells into humans would also cause an immune response
5582192 thats the beauty of this kind of noninvasive imaging system
5582193 it allows us to assess the response of one animal to a variety of conditions and gives us much more valuable information

5582203 my master may be sore with me in leaving this message but i have stayed quite for too long two hearts were broken over this unfortunate event it must make you feel better to think that he did not mourn you but he did and in a way he still does you are rather presumptuous of others emotions and thoughts you must be quite the clairvoyant to know such things you had a chance to mend this you had a chance to be a lady admit your wrongs and perhaps salvage a friendship if not the relationship instead you chose to lower yourself into the sewers of humanity be vindictive nasty and even using threats of a personal nature just to wound that takes a very special person and i had once thought better of you i wish i had been wrong and i so sincerely hope that this time you really mean that you are letting go it has to grow tiresome if not for you then those around you to play the victim day in and day out be at peace bashful and use this experience to grow and learn

5582256 i have to admit i never thought david james would win his place back in the team
5582257 but fair play to him when robinsons level dipped he was in the form of his life and he has taken his chance with both hands since you cannot argue with that
5582258 he is the man in the driving seat he owns that number one jersey and he wont just give it away
5582259 he is on a massive high after a brilliant season that culminated in portsmouth winning the fa cup a remarkable achievement
5582260 i think david gets better with age and he is showing great maturity too he probably enjoys the fact that there is less pressure playing at pompey than any of the big four
5582261 people talk about his age but he is definitely capable of staying at the same level for two more years until the world cup
5582262 i played in a world cup in 1990 when i was nearly 41 and i thought i had a very good tournament so it can certainly be done
5582263 if david maintains his form and doesnt get injured which are two fairly big ifs i would expect him to be there in 2010
5582264 paul was unfortunate he just made too many mistakes too close together and he had to pay the price
5582265 i want an england keeper to make no more than one mistake per season but he made probably three in quick succession and he ended up losing his place
5582266 all the best goalkeepers make errors and paul is no exception but the very best ones make fewer
5582267 i sincerely hope that we see a big improvement in paul robinson in a blackburn shirt this season because at his best he is a very fine keeper
5582268 i know he has got it in him to rediscover what made him the england number one in the first place
5582269 it wont be an easy task seeing that in the first four premier league squads there are four foreign starting keepers and frequently so are the back ups
5582270 there are more good keepers around now than there were a few years ago thats for sure
5582271 in robinson scott carson chris kirkland ben foster joe hart and robert green there are enough people for you to expect someone is going to mount a serious challenge
5582272 it is up to each and every one of them to put pressure on david and fight for the jersey i wouldnt commit to any single one of them right now but it is definitely up for grabs
5582273 it would be a great thing for english football if someone could step up and really stake a claim
5582274 tonight is going to be the same objective really come in focused rested up and do the best i can
5582275 its great to just get the experience of the olympics and get myself in front of the judges
5582276 my point was to forget what happened in the prelims
5582277 i came in this morning and it was a brand new day mentally i feel much better than i did yesterday i came back to priorities and what to think about in the right moment
5582278 it seems to be working out better for me now i go home and forget about the semis
5582279 we need to take a good hard look at it
5582280 they were born a day apart they came down with the same infection and were born in the same hospital i think the public needs a clear assurance there was no link
5582281 given the severity of the infection and the rarity of both those infections occurring in that time frame it leaves some unanswered questions
5582282 internal reviews go against open disclosure ive seen cases where families dont get answers
5582283 its very hard to fight that temptation to get on with the rest of my life
5582284 this is not just a samson cree nation problem it is an issue with the four nations
5582285 theyre working so heavily on homicides that they dont have time to work on the other things like the drugs that are in our community
5582286 i just cant describe in words the feeling in our community right now
5582287 until people stand up and say no more this ugly circle will continue
5582288 we have a large number of officers but their response time is horrible they make it hard to turn to the rcmp

5582290 he has served his sentence and the authorities in vietnam will deport him he does not have any sentence to serve in london if he wants to stop wherever he wants to he can do that
5582291 if he wants to he can change flights he is a free man the only problem is the countries he wants to go to because he has to get a visa
5582292 he is looking forward to coming back he is thinking about being free but worried about reporters he is ok but he is worried about his health he has problems with his hearing and his heart
5582293 we have heard about suicide bombers on foot they are receiving
5582294 according to our reports about 30 taliban tried to attack the salerno base they were fired at we have found six bodies which were all wearing suicide vests
5582295 some of them have blown themselves up others are hiding in nearby houses and corn fields the troops are searching for them
5582296 maar dat was niet zo erg omdat alles dicht bij elkaar zat in het fietsen was ik wel echt goed toen we weg waren met drie wilde de mexicaan niet meer overnemen en ik had met dirk bockel afgesproken om hem los te rijden op de klim ik trok echter iets te hard door waardoor ook dirk moest lossen maar ik heb gewacht omdat ik het laatste stuk niet alleen wou rijden natuurlijk had ik op meer voorsprong gehoopt maar voor de wedstrijd had ik zeker getekend voor die kleine minuut het is namelijk een beetje loterij wie kan wegrijden kijk maar naar peter croes
5582297 ik ben echt verrast over mijn looponderdeel ik heb mijn wedstrijd goed ingedeeld en loop in de tweede helft nog ongeveer even snel als in de eerste daardoor kon ik nog wat mensen inlopen ongelofelijk dat ik na een ronde in het lopen op kop lig op de olympische spelen ik wilde absoluut dirk voorbij op het einde van de eerste ronde zodat ik op kop voorbij de tribunes kon passeren nu gaan we hier nog een dag of zes feesten en peking en dan is mijn eerste wedstrijd de zwintriatlon in knokke op 3 september
5582298 ik ben echt niet tevreden mijn zwemmen en fietsen waren meer dan goed maar het lopen was zeer slecht begin dit jaar liep ik in hetzelfde veld anderhalve minuut sneller ik heb de laatste weken aan overdaad gedaan het schema was nochtans perfect maar de fout ligt bij mij in de fietsproef ben ik een beetje op kousenvoeten weggereden maar toen ik zag dat ik alleen zat had ik door dat het geen zin had en heb ik eens goed gevloekt na het fietsen wilde ik nog gaan voor een top 16 of zelfs een top 8 al zou dat wel heel moeilijk geweest zijn ik ben wat rustiger vertrokken dan normaal in het lopen maar ben er eigenlijk nooit ingekomen
5582299 all i will say is that my client maintains his innocence
5582300 we were informed this morning of the news from antigua and we are pleased at how the investigation is progressing

5582325 sie versuchen den inhalt der erzielten vereinbarungen ber die regelung der situation zu entstellen dieser regelung liegt der mit frankreich am 12 august in moskau abgestimmte sechs punkte plan zugrunde
5582326 am ersten tag der olympischen spiele hielt sich die zahl der anfragen f r werbe und marketingauftritte noch sehr in grenzen
5582327 seit diesem wochenende erhalten wir rund 50 anfragen pro tag
5582328 ich mache das nun schon eine ganze weile aber mit dem was hier passiert habe ich ganz sicher nicht gerechnet
5582329 dieser wert k nnte sich nun aber zumindest kurzfristig verdoppeln
5582330 das interesse das ein sportler f r marketingzwecke hervorruft h ngt von mehreren aspekten ab
5582331 aber auch der stellenwert den eine spezifische sportart in einem bestimmten land inne hat ist in diesem zusammenhang ausschlaggebend

5582342 well do our best to bring back bengal into the elite division initially after taking over we faced a problem in which most of the seniors wanted to leave the state
5582343 they felt that by representing bengal in plate division their chances of making the national or india a side will be less which is a genuine reason
5582344 we had to convince them and then seven players manoj tiwary ranadeb bose laxmi ratan shukla ashok dinda wriddhiman saha and saurasish lahiri pledged to play for bengal and give their best shot to bring back the glory days

5582384 but i would be doing this anyway because i feel john mccain will make a great president he is one of the most authentic leaders i have ever seen
5582385 john mccain has stood up against his party and his president
5582386 there is a hunger now in this country for a leader a president who is clearly bi partisan a leader who will reach across the aisle to solve problems
5582387 its my goal in this position to target independents and democrats to vote for john mccain
5582388 first i have a personal reason to support sen mccain my dad was a prisoner of war like mccain second like sen clinton mccain has worked across the aisle to get things done and thats what we need
5582389 most of the democrats i have talked to feel that obamas positions would move the country too far to the left
5582390 people look at this race and they realize that whoever gets this job will have a tough road ahead
5582391 the economy is bad and there are crises all over the world when they look at obamas resume they just dont see the qualifications there
5582392 john mccain is not george bush and i think americans are smart enough to see that
5582393 the conventions are an important part of the presidential election process and hp is pleased to partner with both parties for the conventions in 2008 just as we did in 2000 and 2004

5582395 weve seen detroit improving though its foreign competitors improved more
5582396 this year is more ominous the gap is extending detroit is falling its all foreign at the top and all american at the bottom
5582397 we still say with a high level of confidence that the level of our customer satisfaction is improving for most of our brands based on independent studies and internal data
5582398 the average consumer pays more attention to j d power and consumer reports
5582399 at the end of the day you still have to satisfy the consumer you still have to have the products that people want to buy
5582400 we have a renewed and intensified focus on satisfying our chrysler jeep and dodge customers that has been under way for about a year
5582401 the new management is committed to satisfying our customers at every level we are beginning to see in internal numbers improvements that indicate we are on the right path
5582402 this survey runs counter to the results of other recent surveys in which weve made great progress
5582403 the good news is that overall the satisfaction scores compared to many other industries that we look at are high
5582404 we could get frustrated but the wheels come off when you start to argue
5582405 theres no point you stop and figure it out you talk about it instead of turning your back on your teammate
5582406 we came out flat against belgium and we learned a lot from that
5582407 its important to have a fast start and we did that we played the best team weve played so far and we played steady
5582408 whether through luck or skill or both what apple has been great at is combining innovation with a great feel for what the marketplace would respond to then backing that up with reasonable service
5582409 its surprising in a way and maybe it cant last forever but we see no evidence that those problems have had any impact on satisfaction
5582410 i think apple will still be on top but others will think of something to avoid further declines
5582411 people are seeing on the whole much better experiences from dell than they have the past couple years
5582412 i know their players very well i know their structures and set ups so theyll probably change a few things i would think from what they had last year knowing that ive got a reasonable idea of how they perform
5582413 having said that the games about the players and they determine the outcomes of the games
5582414 at the end of the day theyve been hit with some injuries and with that comes a drop in confidence and a drop in form
5582415 and theyve lost a lot of close games the previous year they won them
5582416 but you could argue that in patches during the year theyve played very well and i expect them to be very competitive this week at home
5582417 i dont think theyd want to lose to the bottom team i think theres a fair bit of fight still there from choco mark williams and all of the guys i know
5582418 the way port are going and the way we are going i hope its going to be an exciting game and we both attack and if its a high scoring game that would be great to watch
5582419 we have heard about suicide bombers on foot they are receiving indirect fire
5582420 we will not be deterred we will not retreat and we will never surrender the lives of these defenceless whales to the outlaw whalers from japan
5582421 if the japanese police succeed in arresting any of these three men we will use the courts as a forum to focus international attention on japans continued illegal whaling activities
5582422 he left our prison early this morning and he is now already far from here
5582423 i just got the information that hes in ho chi minh city
5582424 its a change in mindset and i think if the message is something thats very well understood and very comprehensive itll start people thinking and having more kids
5582425 there are also some women who have made the decision to stay at home just like my wife whos my home anchor and i would have loved to see some things done for them
5582426 hes encouraging people to get married and hes giving out more bonuses and everything so i guess itll probably wake some of the singles up
5582427 for the first time you get a sense that these measures are taken on board as a result of direct input from the women who know what the challenges are and what some of the proposed solutions would be
5582428 we need to ensure that the young are with us so its not just about technology technology is a medium but we need to use whatever medium we have to let the people understand the issues
5582429 it reflects hes very technologically savvy and hes in tune with what the young are feeling
5582430 its good to see hp get into this market and bring some competition to apple
5582431 even better it looks like theyve really looked at what business travelers need and want concentrating on keeping the size down and battery life up moreover they did it while still providing a usable 12 1 inch screen size
5582432 theyre made to travel and will certainly get bumped bruised and bent on the road while they dont have the absolute lowest weight they do have some interesting feature combinations including integrated optical drives which some of the other ultra portables dont have
5582433 this defeat marks an unwillingness by the legislature to tackle the root of our perpetual budget problems a lack of fiscal discipline
5582434 unless we set a strict standard on spending growth california state government will continue this disastrous pattern of spending beyond our means and looking to taxpayers to bail the state out
5582435 california s politicians have proven time and again that if you give them 1 they will spend 1 05
5582436 without real structural change it will be no time before we will find ourselves back in this same exact position today s vote against real reform was a vote for the status quo a vote that condemns our state to incessant fiscal crisis rather than leading our state toward lasting fiscal stability
5582437 this is a creative way to help those teachers who are priced out of their school districts housing market to afford to move closer to their classrooms
5582438 when teachers have to drive an hour or more to and from work it has a negative effect on their school community rather than spending time on the freeway they could be spending more time with students and extra curricular activities the bill promotes local control and allows communities to decide if they want to take this step which could improve recruiting and retention of teachers
5582439 it would give us the ability to offer our employees a quality housing option close to where they work which would help us retain teachers and classified employees and the income would help us offset maintenance costs district wide which would enable us to focus more of our existing resources on teaching and learning
5582440 assembly bill 1112 would create an innovative initiative that supports children s education by addressing teacher housing needs
5582441 the challenge facing our teachers and ultimately our children is the severe lack of affordable housing in the neighborhoods where our children reside due to the scarcity of available land the lack of affordable housing results in teachers needing to seek employment elsewhere thereby reducing the number of highly qualified teachers in our district this bill will assist in highly qualified teachers remaining in their neighborhood schools and the district would be able to recruit more highly qualified teachers to areas not previously considered affordable
5582442 these displays do have important educational benefits but using bodies against a person s will is unacceptable
5582443 this bill will end the practice of unwilled dead body trafficking
5582444 as an asian american i know that few people from my community would voluntarily donate their organs or bodies due to the strong cultural preference of leaving their body intact for burial after death
5582445 i am hopeful that the bill will receive the governor s signature and the practice of unwilled body trafficking will be put to a halt
5582446 i am pleased that my assembly colleagues chose to support this measure to better protect californians from pollution the more tools to enforce california s environmental laws the better
5582447 it is necessary to make sure the public our firefighters and police officers are protected
5582448 a group of women want a special price on the diamond necklace what can we sell it for
5582449 we sell it for that and we wont have a business
5582450 ill give it to you for this price with one condition
5582451 the group of women you get to be part of it
5582452 i liked the story of the deal and getting the necklace for the price we did
5582453 but the story of sharing it is a truly great conversation topic
5582454 i shopped to fill the holes in my life today i shop just to look since owning the necklace ive started to give away my accessories the truth is theres nothing i need anymore
5582455 its why ive worked so hard to get an informal education
5582456 im always seeking new information always taking a class great books seminars legislative workshops computer classes i ask myself what do college grads know that i dont
5582457 im a black and white person i dont see too much gray listening to the others viewpoints made me less narrow minded theyve broadened my outlook and theyre so empowered themselves that being with them has empowered me
5582458 as weve gotten older he wants to be home more and i want to be out more the rest of our life together is good i love him more than ever but i saw many women going out with their husbands while i sat home i learned it was my responsibility to get the social life i wanted
5582459 after ive had a few hours of fun im much nicer to live with
5582460 after five years of marriage i woke up one day and my husband was gone
5582461 i was devastated but i realized i could have a better life
5582462 women werent in my comfort zone when i joined the group i could have dominated the discussions the others had an unnatural respect for me as a physician but im not an authority on everything my ability has been to listen and to help us move forward
5582463 before this my life was all about work these women have given me a foundation i didnt have
5582464 i almost didnt let him face berkman but we couldnt make a play for him in the last inning and i wanted to give him the opportunity to get the complete game
5582465 the reason i let him go a little bit farther was because of the off days coming up hes going to pitch on six days rest this time and a seven the time after that thats why we did it allow our big guys to go deeper into games than they normally would go
5582466 consejo inversor para el 2 semestre del a o 2008 espero que os sea de provecho
5582467 by the next ge general election 5 years will have passed cyber years are like dog years one year in cyberspace equals to 7 years in real life
5582468 thats the pace at which things change so 5 years times 7 means 35 years in the real world
5582469 there you are simple as that ive just made our first non political video
5582470 some things are obviously alright factual footage documentaries recordings of live events but i think some things should still be off limits for instance if you made a political commercial so that its purely made up material partisan stuff footage distorted to create a slanted impression
5582471 the overall thrust of all these changes is to liberalise our society to widen space for expression and participation we encourage more citizens to engage in debate to participate in building our shared future
5582472 we will progressively open up our system even more if you compare today with 5 years ago 10 years ago its much more open today
5582473 since then there has been a clash going on between nato and the taliban six taliban were killed after they blew up the bombs they had on their bodies two children have been killed and two more along with a woman have been wounded
5582474 we were telling each other lets go out and make history lets go out and get this sweep
5582475 i felt like we were the best three in the world
5582476 i came to the birds nest to lay a golden egg and thats what i did
5582477 the usa hasnt really had a great showing so far and we wanted to uplift the track team with the sweep
5582478 we were telling each other lets go out and make history lets go out and get this sweep
5582479 i felt like we were the best three in the world
5582480 i came to the birds nest to lay a golden egg and thats what i did
5582481 the usa hasnt really had a great showing so far and we wanted to uplift the track team with the sweep

5582483 we set a rigorous standard and the test itself is reflecting the standards that have been written
5582484 we are extremely competitive worldwide in science at eighth grade
5582485 there are still going to be lists in the newspapers of school districts and their scores and that publicity is all it takes to make things change in a school district
5582486 if there were every school would be racing to do that
5582487 you might think these kids are all so computer savvy and they are
5582488 but i dont know if theyre used to doing so much testing that way that might have thrown a lot of kids off
5582489 i would still argue that in the state of minnesota kids are getting a high quality science education
5582490 its just not at the level that we want it to be at
5582491 at the end of the day the goal is to get him out of office by any political means necessary
5582492 we live in a democracy where the vote of the people is supreme
5582493 i said from the beginning there was nothing in the charter that supported his removal through forfeiture
5582494 i knew the charter did not specifically address it i didnt want to waste taxpayer dollars
5582495 the heavier weight is 100 percent in the governors hand
5582496 she has no choice but to go forward and do something
5582497 its unfortunate the city council ignored those constitutional rights and attempted to twist the city charter to fit their own political ambitions
5582498 my mom and dad are not flying over from delhi my birthday is not such a big deal for me id just be happy to spend it with kareena kapoor and my kids
5582499 rakha bandhan is always special for me as my two sisters celebrate it in a big way every year and this year it is even more special because it also coincides with my birthday on earlier occasions of raksha bandhan i have always presented them with gifts but this time i am expecting a gift from them
5582500 this province is so rich but its providing so little for caregivers
5582501 while tim is already a familiar face around sumner city hall it was his variety of experience defending prosecuting and serving as a judge that really made him a good fit for sumner
5582502 but a few years ago i asked some students if they knew what watergate was and they said that was where monica lewinsky lived
5582503 it also prevents students from thinking that the way something is now is the way its always been
5582504 the green bay packers almost always had the same quarterback
5582505 i mean for as long as i can remember brett favre was the man there
5582506 its almost crazy to think he could retire or be with another team
5582507 harry potter could be a classmate playing on their quidditch team
5582508 i wish it was sort of true being on quidditch with him would be kind of cool
5582509 we say join the club it makes us feel old too
5582510 while we know this settlement will never ease the pain of those enduring enormous heartbreak it does bring years of court proceedings to an end
5582511 to have a fire inspector miss the foam on several occasions i just dont see how they would have survived the scrutiny of a trial
5582512 how can they decide that all 100 that died and all that was burned and everything all the survivors that their lives are only worth 10 million
5582513 cant be a crime because heavenly father is the one that tells warren when a girl is ready to get married
5582514 if a 12 year old has been married to a gentleman over the age of 50 there is no way a sibling doesnt know that and hasnt had to cope with that knowledge
5582515 they couldnt find abuse the first time it came up whats changed

5582523 its important that we get together now to prepare for what will possibly be our toughest qualifier for the world cup because we go into the unknown against uzbekistan
5582524 were going into an environment that were not used to and they had an extremely good qualifying round previously so its going to be tough
5582525 ever since guus hiddink came in and completely changed our formations and got us thinking about different styles weve learned to adapt to anything
5582526 and the uzbeks have got us thinking were going to have to work on our system and our system only and make sure that we can adapt in the first five minutes to whatever gets thrown at us
5582527 the next few games arent about winning necessarily its about a good performance and preparing for uzbekistan which inevitably is the most important game
5582528 we saw a little bit of them at the asian cup last year they looked a pretty good side
5582529 theyre going to be a very very difficult game for us away thats why these two friendly games are important because we can get together as a squad and get some game time under our belts
5582530 memanglah pilihan raya kecil permatang pauh ini pertarungan satu lawan satu antara pkr dan bn tiada parti lain

5582536 saya tidak menentang anwar bila saya berkawan dengan seseorang saya berkawan hingga ke akhira
5582537 bila saya menemui penduduk permatang pauh ramai bertanyakan pasal dakwaan liwat ini tapi saya serahkan kepada mereka untuk menilainya itu isu peribadi

5582543 the situation has improved quite a lot in regards to the standoff between the militaries from both sides
5582544 the tension around the area has been eased we hope very much that the situation will go back to normal as soon as possible

5582548 from my perspective and in my own opinion open source software has enjoyed security through lack of widespread adoption
5582549 weve wracked our brains to think of some kind of captive approach we can do by taking it in and rearing it ourselves but it seems to be impossible in australia and possibly around the world
5582550 its just heartbreaking the only thing we can do is monitor the little fella and hope he finds a new mum
5582551 we have come from a different background and this is a mandate the people have given to us to lead the country to peace
5582552 i think our first step should be to get the united states of america fully engaged
5582553 there is no way the first world can solve this problem alone even if the united states comes in
5582554 that is why australia coming in to the kyoto protocol is critical
5582555 i think our officials are working very closely on this to make sure there are no barriers toward linking these schemes and based on my advice there are none
5582556 an area of endeavor for us is what we do domestically on the renewable energy front
5582557 he was indias best bet in pakistan we will miss musharraf
5582558 if he had not fired his judges and gotten bogged down in domestic dramas i believe we would have been able to make a significant breakthrough in a peace deal in kashmir today
5582559 we have no comments to make on the resignation of president musharraf of pakistan
5582560 still musharraf was a one man go to guy in pakistan now who do we speak to these are very uncertain times
5582561 the board knows exactly the stance of the players the players have said what they had to say it is up to the board to make the decision i am sure everything is going to be looked at
5582562 it remains to be decided whether new types of subsidies are necessary or whether existing levels should be altered by adjusting terms that have held some subsides flat for a decade
5582563 but in order to best decide how to aid the m t a in the future a common understanding of how much assistance the city and state provide today is needed
5582564 although people have been charged there is still a lot of work to do and other lines of inquiry that need to be followed up
5582565 the investigators have made a significant stride and hopefully this dreadful case is coming to its conclusion
5582566 all i will say is that my client maintains his innocence
5582567 we were informed this morning of the news from antigua and we are pleased at how the investigation is progressing
5582568 may i suggest if there are five blokes to every girl we should find out where there are beauty disadvantaged women and ask them to proceed to mount isa
5582569 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face
5582570 whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
5582571 we are offended and we want to settle the score
5582572 it paints the women here as second rate and suggests that the men will settle for anything he has put everyone down
5582573 were going to get together to put forward our opinion
5582574 we have received calls from past mt isa residents who are currently living overseas and read about the mayors comments online theyre shocked and outraged
5582575 there are much more serious regional and economic issues plaguing our town than what we all look like
5582576 there are lots of lovely women here but the men just arent up to the game
5582577 to be honest there just arent top quality men here
5582578 they are too busy drinking xxxx to notice the women and all they do is whistle or yell or beep as you go past those sorts of communication skills which i just love
5582579 weve got a saying up here that the odds are good but the goods are odd
5582580 the guys dont make much of an effort with the girls there isnt much wining and dining going on
5582581 i dont think the guys are terribly romantic from what ive seen
5582582 we have heard about suicide bombers on foot they are receiving indirect fire
5582583 the data centre industry is a voracious user of power and were serious about playing our part in reducing our impact on the environment while leading the industry in our delivery of managed hosting services
5582584 but a few years ago i asked some students if they knew what watergate was and they said that was where monica lewinsky lived
5582585 it also prevents students from thinking that the way something is now is the way its always been
5582586 the green bay packers almost always had the same quarterback
5582587 i mean for as long as i can remember brett favre was the man there
5582588 its almost crazy to think he could retire or be with another team
5582589 harry potter could be a classmate playing on their quidditch team
5582590 i wish it was sort of true being on quidditch with him would be kind of cool
5582591 we say join the club it makes us feel old too
5582592 but imperium is solely focused right now on getting through some big challenges facing them as well as the industry as a whole
5582593 the cost of input primarily soy and corn costs too much given the price they get for their biodiesel
5582594 the only long term future for biodiesel is for 18 wheelers hybrid vehicles and maybe airlines
5582595 the soldiers told us they had an order from putin leave or be killed
5582596 strength wise its been great you just dont want to get out there and set yourself back obviously its trusting the doctors and head trainer ronnie barnes who has been doing this for 30 years so they are very excited about my progress and im feeling good about it
5582597 i always know what to expect of me and it always hurts to see your guys going out there and you miss the camaraderie but those guys know ive never been one to take any time off from that standpoint that is reassuring guys know me personally so most of my frustrations are gone to be honest with you my main thing is for everyone to see a healthy no 85 out there
5582598 its a four month surgery so im at four months
5582599 thats what i was told and you always want to beat the odds i think anytime ive ever missed time ive beat the time they have set theyd say 4 6 weeks and id be back in four but this is four months and im right at four months
5582600 we will not be deterred we will not retreat and we will never surrender the lives of these defenceless whales to the outlaw whalers from japan
5582601 if the japanese police succeed in arresting any of these three men we will use the courts as a forum to focus international attention on japans continued illegal whaling activities
5582602 eventhough there has been hardships faced because of the the economic situation the church members have always given abundantly to the church
5582603 this is shown in the number of choirs that have registered every year and the number is increasing all the time
5582604 i believe we will finch around 1am or 2am today since we have a long way to go and even on monday night the singing ended at 1am
5582605 the delay has been the number of choirs that have registered and most of them have come to register here since they missed out registering at the main office

5582607 theres got to be some middle ground somewhere and thats what were trying to find
5582608 i think the good thing is were talking about it and were being smart about it
5582609 wenn zweifelsfrei festgestellt werden kann dass der ehemann der absender der elektronischen scheidungsbekundung ist gibt es keinen grund die trennung nicht zuzulassen

5582611 ich m chte die restlichen jahre meines lebens als seine frau verbringen ich will keine scheidung
5582612 i just feel like i dont click with you i just dont care well never be friends
5582613 why dont television screens in the west show the suffering of the ossetian people the murdered elderly people and children and the destroyed civilian towns western medias coverage of the events is a politically motivated version to put it mildly
5582614 we should immediately call a meeting of the north atlantic council to assess georgias security and review measures nato can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation
5582615 the us should immediately convene an emergency session of the united nations security council to call on russia to reverse course

5582624 i know their players very well i know their structures and set ups so theyll probably change a few things i would think from what they had last year knowing that ive got a reasonable idea of how they perform
5582625 having said that the games about the players and they determine the outcomes of the games
5582626 at the end of the day theyve been hit with some injuries and with that comes a drop in confidence and a drop in form
5582627 and theyve lost a lot of close games the previous year they won them
5582628 but you could argue that in patches during the year theyve played very well and i expect them to be very competitive this week at home
5582629 i dont think theyd want to lose to the bottom team i think theres a fair bit of fight still there from choco mark williams and all of the guys i know

5582633 sudans anti terrorism special courts are nothing but a travesty of justice
5582634 some of the people sentenced yesterday monday only met their lawyers for the first time during the trial while several said they suffered torture when they were held incommunicado and that they were forced to confess the crimes
5582635 the sudanese government has the duty to investigate crimes and bring the perpetrators to justice but they must do it in accordance to international law and their own constitution which guarantees fair trials
5582636 we urge the sudanese authorities not to execute these men and to review their cases immediately according to sudans laws
5582637 is dictated by the necessity to preserve the stability of the country and its democratic institutions
5582638 we want national and international opinion to understand the reasons for the change on august 6 which were vital for mauritania and for the maintenance of its democracy and its pluralism

5582640 the human body is meant for far greater things than the porn industry
5582641 i wanted people to be very clear on the risks
5582642 theyre realizing that the risks are there and theyll realize that the benefits outweigh the risks and theyll come begging for it

5582646 med tanke p udviklingen p de amerikanske markeder i nat s er der udsigt til at de danske renter kan falde lidt tilbage fra morgenstunden
5582647 wenngleich es sich hier nicht um eine repr sentative umfrage handelt geben die ergebnisse dennoch die erfahrungen aus der antdiskriminierungsarbeit wieder
5582648 in anbetracht der ergebnisse verwundert es kaum dass noch zu wenig betroffene mit migrationshintergrund auch rechtliche schritte einleiten um gegen die erlebte diskriminierung vorzugehen
5582649 diese als auch andere ergebnisse zeigen dass deutschland dieser verpflichtung noch nicht gerecht geworden ist nach 2 jahren agg m ssen sich die daf r verantwortlichen fragen was sie in dieser zeit tats chlich auf den weg gebracht haben um von diskriminierung betroffene zu unterst tzen
5582650 es bedarf jedoch weitreichender ma nahmen insbesondere auf bundesebene die direkt betroffene ansprechen und sie ber ihre rechte aufkl ren eine breit angelegte medienkampagne mit fernsehspots auch in den sog migrantischen medien w re sicherlich ein erster schritt in die richtige richtung
5582651 russia is a state that is unfortunately using the one tool that it has always used when it wishes to deliver a message that is its military power
5582652 i think the french will undoubtedly be seeking from the russians an explanation for why the russian president either wont or cant keep his word
5582653 were reinforcing the point that they are safely within the transatlantic structures
5582654 thats just to remind people that russia is a far cry in terms of its geostrategic centre from where the soviet union was
5582655 i think everybody recognises that this is not the first time that weve seen this problem
5582656 weve had russian strategic aviation challenging even along borders with the united states which i might note is a very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
5582657 the hope had been that russia was going to build its foundation and relationships with europe and the united states on the basis of russian economic political cultural and other kinds of assets
5582658 and reminding people that bears can fly near norway or near alaska and that you can use military force against a small neighbour is not a particularly appealing message or image

5582661 in the current crisis situation the government believes that it is for the time being not appropriate for sweden to carry out military exercises with russia or exchange visits between individual units
5582662 a swedish naval visit that was planned in a russian harbour in september has been cancelled
5582663 the russian troops must halt all activity that is destabilizing georgia for instance the destruction of infrastructure or blockades of important roads
5582664 the russian incursion into georgia is unacceptable and a crime against international law

5582668 resilience is the capacity of a system to absorb disturbance and reorganise while undergoing change so as to still retain essentially the same function structure identity and feedbacks
5582669 national food security is neither necessary nor is it desirable
5582670 the manner in which the components that make up a system are linked
5582671 centralised governance and globalisation can weaken feedbacks as feedbacks lengthen there is an increased chance of crossing a threshold without detecting it in a timely fashion
5582672 he said oh my lord i dont have no brakes it happened so quick
5582673 i ran out of my house to join 10 people trying to lift up the bus

5582675 the light turned red and i couldnt stop i tried to miss her

5582678 medvedev betrayed us there in ossetia they mowed down 2000 of our guys and he made peace this is a political war

5582683 i dont know who went where but they fired on our positions with rockets on saturday
5582684 its a good thing they missed but dont write about that write about how we stole 22 000 lari about 16 000 from two bank machines in gori and gave the money to the peasants
5582685 who are you where are you coming from where are you going
5582686 im not letting americans through whats going on there in tbilisi have you heard anything when will saakashvili knock it off
5582687 i dont know who went where but they fired on our positions with rockets on saturday
5582688 its a good thing they missed but dont write about that write about how we stole 22 000 lari about 16 000 from two bank machines in gori and gave the money to the peasants
5582689 the losses are growing by the minute the baku tbilisi ceyhan pipeline is not operating and now you cant move oil by rail either
5582690 the grad complexes forty missiles each after that the grass wont grow never mind people
5582691 every last penny from the gm ad is being donated and split between several environmental organizations exploring alternative energy and effecting change on a grass roots level
5582692 i think it would be a benefit for the public to know when the committee is meeting and to be able to see the information as the committee meets that ultimately will be presented in a report
5582693 there is no foreclosure at the moment theres a notice thats been posted i dont really have any other comments there should be no real changes for the residents

5582704 to get the facts first hand and to show his support for georgias people and its democratically elected government
5582705 the title is more of a reference to the spiritual birthplace of the last few herd albums theres a place a way north of sydney called summerland point thats where the previous albums were conceived so we really wanted to reference that
5582706 in some ways it was quite similar we started by getting a whole bunch of records doing sampling getting some rough ideas on how to proceed then we brought in the musicians and the beatmakers who will look at the samples and will know how to get to a bigger cohesive sound one thing we definitely did different was to up the level of songwriting we really wanted to make this a better written album
5582707 everything on this album works tighter than it ever has before
5582708 it can be a very disjointed process but you have to learn to trust the other people in the band thats a very important factor weve learned to do that after four albums and weve gotten to a pretty good place in the past weve chopped and changed especially the touring lineup but the lineup weve got now weve had for a while and weve built up that comradery
5582709 we were a little bit nervous at some of the venues because the presales were lower than we expected but all of them have really come through canberra was one of the tricky area its notorious for not having too many presales and we really like to have a full house but we rocked up there and it was packed luckily we havent played too many shows not at capacity because it definitely makes a difference plus it also helps the crowd to get involved when theres more people there
5582710 the new songs is the main new thing but we didnt really have visuals before and yeah theyre all sort of elephant related its nice to be performing and then turn around and see the visuals backing you up plus weve been practising heaps in the past we probably should have practised more so weve been rehearsing as much as possible
5582711 well the elephant tracks label is coming up for its 10th anniversary
5582712 usually with a festival you rock up do your 40 minutes and go home it feels a bit short but you generally get to play to a lot more people that a club show you can also finish pretty early which gives you more of a chance to just hang out see some bands catch up with friends
5582713 its really the story of the australian music industry i mean we have a lot of respect for those guys the rock bands but they do their thing and we do ours and its quite different
5582714 sure i think that would be great to see because it hasnt really been done in australia before obviously the hilltops hoods would have to be involved to really get people going along it would be interesting to see if a promoter could pull it off

5582734 one of the few success stories in the administrations effort to nurture new democracies
5582735 it is scorned worldwide afghanistan is backsliding the bar has been set low in iraq georgia is in ruins
5582736 this action is a real challenge to the idea of building a europe whole free and at peace
5582737 i have seen it over and over again be misconstrued by nations not used to dealing with us
5582738 i think they misunderstand our eagerness and enthusiasm and think we are going to be behind them for anything that is what happened in hungary in 1956 and in czechoslovakia in 1968

5582743 so i have a secret i dont like ballet sort of absurd since i make tutus right well its not entirely that i dont like ballet i mean i find the movement and costumes beautiful and i bet i would love the story if i knew what the heck the story was but when i see a ballet it just does not come together for me i was pretty excited to get to review prima princessa presents swan lake i figured if it is a dvd for kids then it must be more user friendly than other ballet videos i have seen well let me tell you it is really neat first and foremost i now know the story of swan lake i have seen the ballet before and honestly did not know what the story was and for those of you wondering i am actually a smart person ballet is just hard for me to understand second it is just really fun third my 14 month old daughter sat through the entire thing and seemed to actually like it she clapped when the girls on screen clapped it was super cute prima princessa an animated fairy ballerina magically transports a group of little girls to see the paris opera ballet performs select segments of swan lake in between acts the children return home to learn simple ballet steps which are playfully shown mixed into colorful montages of toys animals children and young dancers from the school of american ballet i have to admit that the fact that this dvd was produced by two stay at home moms with no prior movie making experience intrigued me even more mary kate mellow and stephanie troeller were inspired by their childrens love of dance they could not find ballet movies that were appropriate for their children so they made their own amazing huh they also have a blog where you can read about their journey

5582806 it may be typical of the pro obama dungeons amp dragons crowd to disparage a fellow countrymans memory of war from the comfort of moms basement but most americans have the humility and gratitude to respect and learn from the memories of men who suffered on behalf of others

5582852 our relationship with lowe over the past 25 years has been unique and very successful and they have been a key partner in achieving continued growth of stella artois across the world
5582853 through the years weve applied ruthlessly high standards to the quality of work weve produced for stella artois
5582854 compromise is a word you would never hear at lowe regarding this brand and we are exceptionally proud of the work that resulted from that approach we have worked with some great people at inbev and wish the brand well into the future

5582857 when i was doing the research for this report i asked sites how hard their traffic had been hit by the introduction of in stream ads
5582858 the answer was very little usually they reported flat growth for a month or two or a few percent down before normal growth continued
5582859 half the people that leave because of the ad would have left because of the content anyway its like flicking through channels on tv
5582860 it makes sense that in stream ads are more popular because everyone has broadband now and we expect to see richer content on the web
5582861 its also a return to allowing people to sit back again people can relax and be entertained which might be refreshing in this cluttered call to action environment
5582862 they give online publishers access to a revenue stream that many are still missing out on
5582863 they are frightened to accept ads because consumers always say they dont like them and youtube terrifies them by saying that ads lose them the vast majority of traffic

5582880 thats not the message the organizers are sending out this year
5582881 i have been trying to impress upon all of you for years that the hare krishna movement is not a cult but an ancient spiritual tradition with much to offer polish society the presence of the indian ambassador in their village this year obviously confirms this please acknowledge this in your reports
5582882 but theyve added the boat an idea they got from us
5582883 but we can learn from them as well theyve been successfully preaching in this country for almost 15 hundred years we arrived only 30 years ago and are struggling to maintain a few small temples
5582884 but bhakti or the awakening of our love for god sri krishna bhagavan
5582885 he came with a long list of titles but somehow i could sense he wasnt so interested and when i asked why he was buying so many books he said theyre not for me
5582886 hes come for the past two days and has been asking many interesting questions but he always sits in front off to the side i noticed he never turns around to look at the rest of the audience i asked him why he blushed and said hes the local priest hes fascinated by our philosophy and wants to learn more hes been coming in normal clothes and keeping a low profile so his congregation wont notice
5582887 the dharma preached by caitanya mahaprabhu is universal and not exclusive the principle of kirtan as the future church of the world invites all classes of men without distinction of caste or clan to the highest cultivation of the spirit this church it appears will spread worldwide and replace all sectarian churches which exclude outsiders from the precincts of the mosque church or temple
5582888 theyre not saying anything different from us if they criticize us you can politely ask them to leave but otherwise they are welcome
5582889 did you come with the devotees on one of the buses from ukraine or croatia
5582890 i live here in kostrzyn ive been coming to krishnas village of peace every year since i was nine years old i wait all year for you to come throughout the year i read your books and chant hare krishna my mom encourages me shes catholic but she says you are worshiping the same god and i can become a hare krishna if i want
5582891 would you please be my spiritual master and accept me as your disciple
5582892 in the books it says many times that a devotee should learn about krishna from a spiritual master
5582893 i listen to your lectures every time you are here
5582894 and i sing hare krishna with you well into the night throughout woodstock i know you very well
5582895 im lost in this world i want to go back to krishna
5582896 ive been praying to god every day for an entire year that you would accept me as your disciple
5582897 even on sundays in church and i follow all the rules
5582898 i wish it could be like this all the time
5582899 so many hundreds of thousands of people getting so much mercy
5582900 ive been watching all of you since the first day
5582901 youre working so hard but why do you do all of this its such a big operation so many tents so many programs and so much food and most of its free you cant be making much money
5582902 we just want to share our good fortune with others
5582903 praying that one day we can serve him again in the spiritual world
5582904 o all auspicious krishna may you be victorious you perform all kinds of sweet pastimes let my name also be there when you count sri radhas associates this is my prayer although i am covered by material consciousness i can still aspire for this o lord may my prayer be fulfilled

5582915 its my first time coming back here and playing in front of hometown fans and my family
5582916 that gets you going a little bit im excited and nervous
5582917 i came to a lot of games here as a kid
5582918 when they won the world series in 1987 and 1991 i remember standing on the corner waving my homer hanky
5582919 its a great thing especially with the stretch were in with no days off
5582920 it will be really nice we never get sundays off
5582921 thanks also for librarian pro it seems like a really nice piece of software that works exactly as i would expect mac software to work
5582922 this app handles books movies music it imports data from amazon and a wide range of other sources handles a library lending function integrates with os x well addressbook etc
5582923 great piece of software but im not surprised i have data guardian and mac pilot both of which are also mighty fine
5582924 i am impressed at least by koingos generosity and i havent even downloaded this software yet ive got all of their other applications every single one because they offered them once as a big bundle at an almost give away price some i dont use at all but others are very handy and they all seem to be of a decent quality im not sure how useful to me librarian pro will be but at a 67 discount im buying it just to show a bit of extra support to what appears to be an unusually open handed company
5582925 i recently purchased lib pro and my compliments on a great little program it imported my delicious and itunes library painlessly and is a fast way to track my cds
5582926 im having real doubts that delicious library is ever going to get updated so this program is looking more and more appealing
5582927 i just started using this today and it is fantastic i buy used books and this is a great way to inventory them as well as everything else i have from dvds to computer software and music in itunes and the last two can be imported by just having librarian pro scan your files fantastic app
5582928 this is a nice library app the ability to import from other libraries including dl is a great timesaver and makes it easy to decide to adopt this over dl the developers appear to be very responsive to bug reports and feature requests the biggest thing this application has over dl is the extensive breakdown of music information i much prefer this implementation over dl
5582929 my friend has this and it works great i love how it will scan by bar codes
5582930 yes wondered also if dl was ever going to be updated so i began looking at this as a replacement rather than mention the problems with dl ill just say librarian seems cleaner and more responsive to me and its actually updated
5582931 its much simpler than delicious library which imho looks very good but is not the best app around and the fact it doesnt restrict what kind of media you can store is a big plus over dl
5582932 looks like a very nice alternative to delicious library which i do have but never got quite comfortable with its interface what i like about librarian pro is how its famiiar interface is similar to most of all the other organisational apps i use
5582933 this app stands out as one of the best of its breed
5582934 i have books and cds everywhere this could really help bring order to life
5582935 this is great software to help organise my collection of books and media
5582936 for a collection of books cds dvds and more this seems to be the absolutely right small and easy to use application
5582937 nice that it is putting multiple databases in one program rather than having separate ones for each type of item such as books movies etc
5582938 this app is beautiful and seems functionally identical to delicious library which i am currently using so i congratulate you on creating this application
5582939 i think that its better that delicious library this app is beautiful very nice interface and seems very useful
5582940 the biggest thing going for delicious library is the barcode scanning however ive found inputting my isbn for library books to be more accurate and almost as fast dl is limited on what you can do after the collection is in the database this is where librarian pro shines
5582941 i just downloaded the librarian pro demo installed it and took a look at what it can do
5582942 the app sounds like what i have been waiting for to catalog my work videos and dvds
5582943 the dual license for my macbook and home pc sold me and though i already use bibliographic software for academic purposes this looks easy and fun to use for my kids
5582944 looks like a very capable competitor to dl and the pedia apps
5582945 this app has more features than delicious library including mac windows support
5582946 this is a really nice product the ui is nice and easy to get around in also the fact that it organizes items as it does is very beneficial
5582947 ive got my library split between work and home and on more than one occasion ive bought books that i already own this should help keep track of what ive bought as well as books ive loaned out and never gotten back two thumbs up
5582948 ive been looking for a good media library program so this is just the ticket
5582949 this is a superb program i was a beta tester for it and use it now for my library at work
5582950 decent software that is a real aid in inventorying all sorts of items particularly software
5582951 having used librarian pro for most of the week now im extremely happy with it and consider it the best possible tool for my purposes you put a lot of comprehensive thought into librarian pro and it shows at every level its the dream of a lifetime to have so much searchable collection data my newly finished databases will help more than just me i have many friends who are musicians and music lovers who often need to get their hands on unusual repertoire thats now out of print so they thank you too for helping me know exactly what ive got i thank you for creating this marvelous tool and making it available at such a reasonable cost you are one of the angels
5582952 this is an awesome application i had and loved delicious library but it lacked some important features your app delivers in droves im very impressed and grateful for your latest
5582953 im currently a delicious library user and although i might still have a need for it i might be switching to this program as my main tool it imported my existing library without a problem i highly recommend giving this one a test drive
5582954 this is a long awaited thing and i have to say its an outstanding app keep up the good work with it
5582955 if youre good at something never do it for free
5582956 i think the city of reno has really taken the right approach in getting in front of this legislation and seeing how it can benefit the community
5582957 it instills confidence not just in builders but also new home buyers that theyre moving forward instead of just waiting for something to happen

5582962 are in private hands and they set the price very high
5582963 continuing worries about a u s economy slowdown which may spread to the euro zone and perhaps also asia are weighing down on oil pricing
5582964 in the near term there will be a lot of downward pressure but i dont foresee a fast collapse of pricing to 100 dollars a barrel or below there is still strong support at 110 a barrel level because of supply side issues
5582965 what were looking at is a fire sale of properties in newer affordable neighborhoods that were bought or refinanced near the price peak with lousy mortgages
5582966 its too early to call it a turnaround but it does indicate were coming off the bottom
5582967 the bottoming out comes when people start buying homes normal homes
5582968 were all looking for good news and some kind of bottom but i just dont see it
5582969 all the others had no kitchens or bathrooms or the toilets were gone or there were holes in the walls
5582970 people can now afford the homes they couldnt have before
5582971 the houses are becoming affordable and interest rates are low thats whats driving sales
5582972 this is about a publishers commitment to its author to get one of a very few pro obama books out into the marketplace in the shortest amount of time
5582973 our initial order was based on the book being available to all booksellers simultaneously an even playing field
5582974 they are not going to bully us and the book will be a huge success in spite of their boycott
5582975 instead of listening to georgians john mccain chose to talk with people who have given him thousands of dollars
5582976 the struggling companies are getting an even tougher road in the near future the question also is do they really have the resources the cash here
5582977 i think there is little question that the domestic automakers are somewhat strapped for resources and they have to go out and borrow money and stuff like that
5582978 whenever they have to do that it is difficult to come up with the same level of quality and the same level of customer satisfaction

5582996 we found that if a teacher has a high achieving group of students pushing them harder by giving them more homework could be beneficial
5582997 similarly if a teacher has a low ability class assigning more homework may help since they may not have been pushed hard enough but for the average achieving classes who may have been given too much homework in an attempt to equate them with the high achieving classes educators could be better served by using other methods to improve student achievement given these students abilities and time constraints learning by doing may be a more effective tool for improvement
5582998 there has been an extensive amount of research examining the influences of students achievement but it has been primarily focused on financial inputs such as class size or teachers credentials
5582999 our study examined the affect that additional homework has on test scores
5583000 this does not mean that homework is unimportant for average achievers
5583001 but it does mean that this population may also benefit from other activities such as sports art or music rather than additional hours of math homework

5583118 fratelli miei carissimi ringraziate iddio il quale ha voluto per le bocche de semplici rivelare i tesori della divina sapienza imper che iddio colui il quale apre la bocca ai mutoli e le lingue delli semplici fa parlare sapientissimamente
5583119 padre a noi non pare che questa rigidit sia secondo la carit divina che suora chiara vergine cos santa a dio diletta tu non esaudisca in cos piccola cosa come mangiare teco e spezialmente considerando chella per le tue predicazioni abbandon le ricchezze e le pompe del mondo e di vero sella ti domandasse maggiore grazia che questa non s la doveresti fare alla tua pianta spirituale
5583120 padre si degna cosa che tu le faccia questa grazia e consolazione

5583167 padre non siete voi uomini comio dunque come la sostenete voi cos potr io con la grazia di cristo
5583168 voi ladroni e crudeli e omicidi non vi vergognate di rubare le fatiche altrui ma eziandio come presuntuosi e isfacciati volete divorare le limosine che sono mandate alli servi di dio che non siete pure degni che la terra vi sostenga per che voi non avete nessuna reverenza n a uomini n a dio che vi cre andate adunque per li fatti vostri e qui non apparite pi
5583169 impero chelli meglio si riducono a dio con dolcezza che con crudeli riprensioni onde il nostro maestro ges cristo il cui evangelo noi abbiamo promesso dosservare dice che non bisogno a sani il medico ma agli infermi e che non era venuto a chiamare li giusti ma li peccatori a penitenze e per ispesse volte egli mangiava con loro conci sia cosa adunque che tu abbi fatto contra alla carit e contro al santo evangelo di cristo io ti comando per santa obbedienza che immantanente tu s prenda questa tasca del pane chio ho accattato e questo vasello del vino e va loro dietro sollecitamente per monti e per valli tanto che tu li truovi e presenta loro tutto questo pane e questo vino per mia parte e poi tinginocchia loro dinanzi e di loro umilmente tua colpa della crudelt tua e poi li priega da mia parte che non facciano pi male ma temano iddio e non offendano il prossimo e segli faranno questo io prometto di provvederli nelli loro bisogni e di dare loro continuamente e da mangiare e da bere e quando tu arai detto loro questo ritornati in qua umilmente
5583170 guai a noi miseri isventurati e come dure pene dello inferno ci aspettiamo i quali andiamo non solamente rubando li prossimi e battendo e ferendo ma eziandio uccidendo e nientedimeno di tanti mali e cos scellerate cose come noi facciamo noi non abbiamo nessuno rimordimento di coscienza n timore di dio ed ecco questo frate santo ch venuto a noi per parecchie parole che ci disse giustamente per la nostra malizia ci ha detto umilemente sua colpa e oltre a ci ci ha recato il pane e lo vino e cos liberale promessa del santo padre veramente questi si sono frati santi di dio li quali meritano paradiso di dio e noi siamo figliuoli della eternale perdizione li quali meritiamo le pene dello inferno e ogni ind accresciamo alla nostra perdizione e non sappiamo se de peccati che abbiamo fatti insino qui noi potremo tornare alla misericordia di dio

5583346 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
5583347 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
5583348 we want to win right away the best thing for this team is that they learn from failures we are really excited this year with the changes to the coaching staff and we feel that success is right around the turn we want success on friday nights this team is conditioned now for success and the expect it
5583349 he is unbelievable an all around great coach this guy knows offense and lives for coaching because he is from monroe city and had success on this field he has a lot of monroe pride
5583350 our skill positions are experienced they know the offense and have bought into coach watsons system but many of our guys play both ways our offensive line is still unproven
5583351 we are multi dimensional we do have great skill guys but an average line the good thing is that we can spread it out and pass the ball or run definitely makes it harder to defend
5583352 speed is our key you arent going to look out there and see 230 lb linebackers you are going to see 155 lb linebackers that like to run powell chinn and hayden these guys get after the football they play with the monroe mentality
5583353 ive always said if youre not very good and everybodys coming back that may not be a good thing but the kids that we have coming back its good to have those kids back
5583354 i think theres several kids that have an opportunity to be real successful thats one of those things that im a pretty firm believer in i dont think we have anybody thats just going to dominate a game but we have alot of guys that are going to contribute and they work so well together if they all do their jobs weve got guys that are going to have real big nights and then the next night it might be somebody different
5583355 theyre bigger and theyre stronger than they were a year ago im excited about what they were able to do last year and i fully expect them to be better this year
5583356 a year ago i think we had seven sophomores starting on offense at one time and i think alot of our problem was inconsistency wed play real well at times and then we would struggle at times and i think part of it is the mental game now that these guys are juniors and seniors i feel alot better about their ability to stay focused through the entire game if we can do that i think well be a lot better football team
5583357 you hear alot of people talking about how were going to be better and of course you hear alot of people saying let em play until you start winning games theres nothing to talk about were better but we have to take it to the field on friday nights and make it turn into wins when they start turning into wins i feel people will look at us alot differently
5583358 hes such a special kid it was extremely serious and were just fortunate he was able to keep all of his body parts there and come back and completely get healthy you go visit him in the hospital for weeks and to have him back hitting people thats what its really about im just thankful that hes still here and he gets an opportunity to play
5583359 its important that we get together now to prepare for what will possibly be our toughest qualifier for the world cup because we go into the unknown against uzbekistan
5583360 were going into an environment that were not used to and they had an extremely good qualifying round previously so its going to be tough
5583361 ever since guus hiddink came in and completely changed our formations and got us thinking about different styles weve learned to adapt to anything
5583362 and the uzbeks have got us thinking were going to have to work on our system and our system only and make sure that we can adapt in the first five minutes to whatever gets thrown at us
5583363 the next few games arent about winning necessarily its about a good performance and preparing for uzbekistan which inevitably is the most important game
5583364 we saw a little bit of them at the asian cup last year they looked a pretty good side
5583365 theyre going to be a very very difficult game for us away thats why these two friendly games are important because we can get together as a squad and get some game time under our belts

5583375 people are looking at you like why does she have those red spots running down here arm

5583377 i could have skin i could have natural skin i could look like a normal person nobody who was you know i mean a modern day leper

5583379 it would be a novel treatment its very exiting if it works
5583380 i just want people to understand even though were one of the first districts asking for this tax election its inevitable that other districts are going to be asking for it in the future as well
5583381 its a wake up call that i believe the voters need to have we need to emphasize what could happen if this does not go through
5583382 a fail proposal could force officals to close schools and cut or eliminate some extracurricular and fine arts programs
5583383 the state could force harlandale to consolidate with another school system
5583384 these are increases after a long period of stability in the auto market
5583385 were seeing an uptick now but we dont consider this to be more than upward pressure from low prices in the past
5583386 its going to take some time to see what impact its going to have
5583387 short term there are things drivers can be doing if the rise in gas prices has significantly decreased the amount of time you spend behind the wheel you should call your insurer that can help you manage your rates as an individual

5583393 now the dust has settled on the latest round of tariff announcements a more complex situation has emerged
5583394 consumers are faced with three choices first they wait and see doing so could risk missing out on the last of the better deals secondly they could sign up for a capped tariff now secured that their outgoings were not going to increase even though it now more expensive or thirdly they get ready to start switching finding a new tariff after each price hike may be the best way to keep on top of rising prices by applying a little regular legwork
5583395 keep your head down keep your left arm straight dont look up swing easy
5583396 in the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the saints
5583397 then there is the tax collector who stands at a distance and dares not even to look up to heaven

5583413 the test for every good fighter is whether he can take a punch
5583414 im tired of good people standing up for whats right and then reaching the breaking point and walking away
5583415 its really amazing to watch them go out and teach the younger players these lessons like the role of a catalyst for example
5583416 they are just so mature and they really enjoy getting more out of being on this team than just volleyball

5583420 we might be a newer school but the expectations here are high and we want to live up to all of them

5583470 i am sorry for the intrusion i tried to call you a few times and there was never an answer
5583471 thats fine i have a lot of time why dont you tell me it
5583472 my son his name was brandon and he for as long as i could remember was always infatuated with gangsters and i didnt think about it his father was killed in an automobile accident on his way to the hospital while i was giving birth and without any grandparents i generally just left him with the neighbors and people i trusted they all loved him he was a little slow but he was so smart he just always loved gangsters and his room was covered with posters of them al pacino in scarface al capone ray liotta and robert deniro in goodfellas and other people like that he had all the movies old and new and was obsessed with them he idolized them i didnt think anything about it i figured it was just a phase and it just didnt bother me it wasnt until one came into our neighborhood that his little fantasy world came to life
5583473 this guy was slick he always looked good his suits were without wrinkles and he had a wife she was stunning my boy was good and never got into trouble and on top of his job at a grocery store he mowed lawns all over the neighborhood he made good money and when this guy came into the picture he immediately went to his house and offered to mow his lawn and the man said of course and i thought was that the man whose name was ted mitchell and his wifes name was rhonda and she was always wearing something skimpy and she flirted with my like crazy in fact he got confidence and just fed off of ted and eventually he even got a girlfriend and they talked all the time then it all changed it all fucking changed
5583474 her name was tammy and she stopped returning his calls i told him it was no big deal he even worried about not seeing her as much as work i had him calmed down and yet naturally he still worried about it i would be too this was his first girlfriend then one day they worked together and that was the day it all changed she started freaking out told him to get away from her and he tried to figure out what was going on and she just kept on screeching at him he only called her a few times to figure out what was going on and he figured it was over so the manager gerald winston heard this and took was a bagger and tammy was a cashier they went up stairs and gerald asked what was going on one thing led to another and heated words were exchanged between the two they went back and forth and gerald lost his temper and told did and naturally god old ted was in the store and offered to take him where told him what was going on brandon eventually went to work the next day where a gloating gerald was waiting for him and he told brandon went home in tears trying to figure out everything i tried to call and talk to gerald and he avoided my calls eventually pushed him so my son was out of work all though he still did well with the mowing of lawns but all the extra money as you can imagine was great it just devastated now one day he got a call on his cell phone and it was from ted ran out of the house and went over to his house ted gave was to deliver this package for a substantial amount of money delivered this package and the next day a huge explosion happened brandon who was always a happy go lucky guy recognized the house and he went from nice and sweet to brooding and dark he spent so much time at teds i didnt know what to do i had no idea what he was up too and it came to a point that brandon started to do his own laundry and started wearing suits he quit his lawn mowing business he was never home and he bought me everything i could want he had so many shoes and so many knew clothes i knew things were bad i knew things were bad there was this case and a top lieutenant inside of the organized crime ring was up for the murder of a cop the district attorney was going to make an example out of him so everyday youd read about a different member of the case winding up dead first it was the judge and the district attorney didnt back off and then it was a member of the jury and then it was district attorney himself eventually the lieutenant got off because everybody was scared shitless i didnt put the pieces together because i was a complete dumb ass and i didnt realize my son was becoming an elite assassin for the mob to be honest i didnt care either there was so much money i got seduced by it i didnt care that my son had a different girl over every night and we were eating clavier and drinking wine older than my son anyway then something happened one day while reading the paper a woman was shot several times and she survived this was a death blow because she was a bookkeeper and she managed to survive and knew everything she was even able to implicate several high ranking members of this organization his bosses for his new career were furious and i was loving the money so much i didnt think about it i should of and i didnt my son was told by ted that he better fix this problem and brandon didnt know what to do for he never had this problem killing was so easy he never encountered a problem this one survived and they wouldnt help him they just pressured him they generally gave him the address and he went to the place and shot them down well he was on his own on this and he had a time limit they got impatient and paid me a visit they worked me over they broke my wrists and a few ribs and the shit hit the fan after that was in a world he never knew he tried to figure out away to kill this girl and she was apparently even going into witness protection and they didnt help him he couldnt find where she was they said they were going to pay me another visit and this time they were going to have several aids infected take me to a undisclosed place and rape me for days brandon lost it and came home that night and he sobbed he told me everything i told him wed go to the police wed settle this and brandon walked out of the house with me screaming at him he went over to teds house and shot his wife wanda he didnt last long as ted blew him away with a shotgun ted and his crew did get the girl for they had an inside source and she was found dead
5583475 you will no longer be among the living and your son will comeback and whatever he was in life he will be worse in death
5583476 complete evil will take over him and he will show no mercy and your captors will not show you anything accept savagery they take you someplace not of this world and it well i know little about it but once you call this number that will be it
5583477 my son was a good boy and i let him become evil just because he was brining home all kinds of money i looked the other way just because he was paying the mortgage on the house because i got to eat lobster for dinner and had nice jewelry i let him do these things and knew in my heart he was up to no good if i have to suffer for the rest of my days or suffer in eternity i am willing to do that because nothing can be worse than this feeling i feel everyday in knowing i let my son become a monster
5583478 no jesus sacrificed himself for us and i will do the same for my son i want them to die by his hands and then will i be able to rest

5583527 we have heard about suicide bombers on foot they are receiving indirect fire
5583528 according to our reports about 30 taliban tried to attack the salerno base they were fired at we have found six bodies which were all wearing suicide vests
5583529 some of them have blown themselves up others are hiding in nearby houses and corn fields the troops are searching for them
5583530 in the absence of any strong lead to trade on locally the philippine market has turned to overseas developments for cues
5583531 wala na there are no more they are all accounted for
5583532 may i suggest if there are five blokes to every girl we should find out where there are beauty disadvantaged women and ask them to proceed to mount isa
5583533 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face
5583534 whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
5583535 really beauty is only skin deep isnt there a fairy tale about an ugly duckling that evolves into a beautiful swan
5583536 im told men outnumber women here by five to one if thats the case then perhaps its an opportunity for some lonely women
5583537 theres a lot of anger circulating among the community at the moment a lot of passionate anger
5583538 it paints the women here as second rate and suggests the men will settle for anything i think its quite disgusting
5583539 weve got a saying up here that the odds are good but the goods are odd
5583540 we deeply regret that we caused the patient irreparable harm we will take measures so that this will never happen again

5583548 reducing bad stress often can be done by reducing bureaucracy and listening to employees concerns to see if they can be addressed
5583549 what you generally dont want to do is try to reduce employees overall stress levels by taking away the good stress the aspects of a job they find enjoyable and energising
5583550 a big problem with these reactions is that they dont always go away once the stress is reduced
5583551 people become addicted to alcohol or irreparably harm their reputation at work or their relationships with family members
5583552 fortunately the really dramatic stress related incidents like workplace shootings are rare
5583553 if you need to lay this type of person off its important to be very explicit about why they were chosen and why this was a logical decision
5583554 if its because of economic reasons be very clear that its because of economic reasons otherwise the tendency to believe theyre out to get me often takes over
5583555 one of the worst things you can do is create ambiguity
5583556 while the managers might think they are sparing feelings they are also giving ex employees an opportunity to spin conspiracy theories which fuel anger and resentment be kind and respectful but also as candid as possible

5583584 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
5583585 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
5583586 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5583587 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5583588 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5583589 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5583590 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5583591 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks
5583592 we also need to check this out and find out if its a cyst or cancer or a disease causing a hormone imbalance
5583593 ser un cimiento m s que soporte un mayor avance de nuestra econom a
5583594 esto se corrobora cada vez que se dan a conocer los resultados de diversas evaluaciones que se hacen a nivel mundial y en las que nuestro pa s ha seguido perdiendo terreno

5583601 were not worried about it weve seen this movie before
5583602 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5583603 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5583604 every hurricane that we have we have additional lessons learned and experience
5583605 wanted to see where i was at and not slow down too much
5583606 i was pretty mad but had to get over it
5583607 it was unfortunate but hey you never know what happens nowadays
5583608 i still have the scars but im happy im thankful
5583609 wanted to see where i was at and not slow down too much
5583610 i was pretty mad but had to get over it
5583611 it was unfortunate but hey you never know what happens nowadays
5583612 i still have the scars but im happy im thankful
5583613 continuing worries about a u s economy slowdown which may spread to the euro zone and perhaps also asia are weighing down on oil pricing
5583614 in the near term there will be a lot of downward pressure but i dont foresee a fast collapse of pricing to 100 dollars a barrel or below there is still strong support at 110 a barrel level because of supply side issues
5583615 the struggling companies are getting an even tougher road in the near future the question also is do they really have the resources the cash here
5583616 i think there is little question that the domestic automakers are somewhat strapped for resources and they have to go out and borrow money and stuff like that
5583617 whenever they have to do that it is difficult to come up with the same level of quality and the same level of customer satisfaction
5583618 he wanted to give them an idea of where he wanted to go with this
5583619 there was no whirring glass bubble like maxwell smart or something like that he was speaking to the integrity of the arrangement
5583620 he literally disabled it even if someone tried to turn it on it wouldnt work
5583621 may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5583622 there is not one shred of evidence that its true
5583623 we are extremely disappointed to see that the level of objectivity at nbc news has fallen so low that reporters are now giving voice to unsubstantiated partisan claims in order to undercut
5583624 i dont think it was that ragey but its all a matter of perspective i guess
5583625 toss me a cigarette i think theres one in my raincoat
5583626 i believe that appropriate treatment including behavioral therapy and medication can benefit children and adolescents with adhd
5583627 he never sat still he never shut up he would never stop asking questions
5583628 he just wanted to go from one thing to another
5583629 its not about the winning its about how one played the game
5583630 si viajamos a torre n zacatecas o mazatl n encontramos que esas ciudades tienen infraestructura mucho m s ventajosa que la nuestra y que en cierta medida esa misma circunstancia nos revela que aunque hemos venido avanzando falta mucho por hacer
5583631 creo que sigue siendo el tema n mero uno a atender en durango pero la sociedad debe saber que el gobierno no genera empleos sino que genera las condiciones para la creaci n de empleos
5583632 sin embargo yo creo que al margen de las evaluaciones tenemos que reconocer que todav a estamos en desventaja que todav a hay una gran expectativa que debemos cumplir para que la infraestructura que presentemos sea atractiva para el inversionista
5583633 la creaci n de infraestructura para el desarrollo de un marco jur dico y la seguridad p blica para que le den a los empresarios la certidumbre y la confianza de que en durango se puede invertir
5583634 no i like to have everyone make their own cocktail

5583716 the struggling companies are getting an even tougher road in the near future
5583717 i think there is little question that the domestic automakers are somewhat strapped for resources and they have to go out and borrow money and stuff like that
5583718 whenever they have to do that it is difficult to come up with the same level of quality and the same level of customer satisfaction
5583719 if you save one job that is one less family out on the street
5583720 it was a much bigger steeper residential drop than i think anyone envisioned
5583721 one of the worst industry downturns since the great depression
5583722 now were starting to see a deceleration in those sectors
5583723 now we have the unprecedented situation of the deepest demand decline and escalating energy prices
5583724 i think it could lead to a major consolidation in the industry in the united states
5583725 ill be honest i didnt know a lot about him before i got here
5583726 but its pretty obvious to me after being here that hes one of the better pitchers in this league

5583729 what is the value of eight golds in beijing before a prime time audience in the u s
5583730 id say 100 million over the course of his lifetime
5583731 the politicization of energy is only beneficial to those running for office
5583732 if our national leadership cannot come to grips with a problem of this severity theres something wrong with the process and the people
5583733 every time the price drops americans just say ok the problem is solved
5583734 just having prices ease up a little bit at the pump did not solve the problem
5583735 well be right back to the pump price that made you uncomfortable originally
5583736 its unrealistic to suggest that alternatives are right around the corner when the infrastructure is not there
5583737 thats different than a two to four year election cycle
5583738 perhaps there is a mentality that you cant beat city hall
5583739 im not a crybaby about what goes on in the world
5583740 people like my mom you expect them to be upset people who are doing a lot of saving now versus people who are done saving are two very different groups
5583741 i shop at the 99 cent stores there are ways of saving money

5583743 the feds rate cuts geared to aiding ailing homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages have come at the expense of savers and retirees dependent on fixed income
5583744 for the past 12 months there has been a double whammy for savers as interest rates have fallen and inflation has increased
5583745 the big problem is theyve been at the demands of wall street for so long to continually increase sales and increase the rate quarter over quarter
5583746 theyve really diluted what that image means as a lifestyle brand

5583748 a free taste would go a long way in making the consumer case for mobile tv

5583785 theres a case for hillary to be on the ticket but the real question is is bill a voice for the campaign and the administration and what do you do about disclosing all of the donors to his foundation and his library
5583786 picking her would have a groundswell impact on democrats but not picking her will leave her to have a new role leading on her issues and supporting barack for president
5583787 i think the convention will help bring the wings of the party together especially the fact that senator clintons name will be put in nomination for a roll call vote that will make a big difference

5583824 i knew this was going to be a tough race the 10 km run was going to be the hardest of my life but i just realized this is what i have been dreaming of this is my only chance
5583825 i just had a not very good day on the run
5583826 i got tired i did train well but today there were three athletes better than me i can only say congratulations to them and i will try again in four years
5583827 advances in recording and performance technology now make it possible for musicians not only to fire the drummer but also if so inclined to do away with accompaniment altogether without losing the richness or seemingly the spontaneity of a full size band
5583828 i think a lot of bands decided to maximalize their sound if thats a word as a kind of reaction to the stark sort of minimalist indie rock in the 90s
5583829 one way to do that is to form these massive collectives and put on big stage shows a more is more kind of thing

5583854 i must say that i was overjoyed that the usual gay bashing didnt occur when the topic of hiv aids among black women and the increasingly high rate of unmarried black women well into their 40s was discussed
5583855 i cant find a suitable black man so im going to date white men

5583886 it is wrong that people can trespass on another persons property and the police should be able to enforce the law which is currently defective
5583887 i am very anxious that we can now have some decent neighbours in it is a bit of a worry being a neighbour to an unoccupied house there is always the threat that someone will get in and be a nuisance to neighbours i am very grateful thankful and relieved that this is at an end
5583888 i am so pleased that there is little damage and the rubbish had been bagged up the fear was that there would be some damage

5583899 sebenarnya saya tak suka bulu tangkis lebih senang melihat bola voli tapi bapak mendorong saya untuk main bulu tangkis
5583900 saya masuk sekolah siang pagi selalu berlatih dan ikut kejuaraan taruna lama lama saya mulai senang dan berniat serius di bulu tangkis daripada latihan dan sekolah berantakan dua duanya
5583901 awalnya saya pikir akan kalah dari tine ternyata dia bisa dilewati jadi saya semakin yakin
5583902 keduanya tetap mendukung saya saat mau dikeluarkan dari pelatnas ko hendrawan juga yang bercita cita tunggal putri indonesia tampil di olimpiade beijing setelah gagal lolos ke olimpiade athena 2004
5583903 kami bisa ngobrol hal lain juga latihan tetap berat tetapi suasananya rileks dan masih bisa bercanda ko hendrawan tahu kondisi kami sehingga kami tahu apa yang harus dilakukan di lapangan
5583904 bukannya enggak mau menang lebih cepat tetapi memang mainnya seperti itu di game pertama saya jarang langsung bisa in dengan permainan saya selalu memulai dengan lob baru menyerang belakangan jika saatnya tepat tak bisa seperti firda adrianti firdasari rekannya di pelatnas yang langsung menyerang
5583905 saya tetap santai dan menikmati permainan tetapi saya sadar ada tanggung jawab ada harapan dari orang lain untuk terus berprestasi saya harus lebih dewasa saya merasa sudah banyak kemajuan meski belum terlalu stabil
5583906 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims

5583910 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
5583911 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
5583912 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
5583913 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
5583914 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
5583915 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
5583916 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
5583917 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
5583918 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
5583919 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

5583923 liu xiang must be sadder than anyone else right now although he pulled out the contest i believe he has already done his best and i believe we are still proud of him
5583924 the most important spirit of olympics is participation as for liu xiang he already won the game when he was standing on the starting line with his injury
5583925 we should not complain about the man who had paid so much more than we can imagine he prepared for 4 years and i don t think he would have just quit like that at the last moment had it not been for the injury
5583926 i value the gold medal but i care much more about the health of liu xiang i will remember his splendor forever no matter how he did this time
5583927 the life of sport is much more important than an olympic gold medal
5583928 i have been waiting for the moment that he can fly again
5583929 we all remember the moment that he created history and he still makes us proud now we will always support him

5583933 hemos mejorado much simo como ha quedado demostrado con nuestros resultados
5583934 no marcamos en el primer partido pero ganamos el segundo y el tercero por 2 1 en cuartos de final anotamos dos goles y mantuvimos nuestra puerta a cero estoy muy contento con estos resultados porque dejan claro que somos un equipo fuerte y bien organizado y que hemos mejorado desde nuestros choque contra estados unidos y jap n
5583935 todav a intentamos encontrar nuestro propio estilo aunque sabemos que tenemos que trabajar m s en defensa nuestro instinto nos obliga a echarnos hacia delante y tratar de marcar por eso en los partidos anteriores dejamos huecos en defensa que no agradaron demasiado al entrenador sin embargo nos ha hecho hincapi en que debemos perfeccionar ese aspecto de nuestro juego y jugar bien organizados y en equipo si queremos triunfar
5583936 tiene calidad a raudales como demuestra su partido contra italia los belgas han superado las expectativas incluso de sus compatriotas nosotros nos concentraremos en nuestro propio juego y en meternos en la final no tenemos la intenci n de preocuparnos demasiado por el rival

5583938 id like to think ive made some people pause reflect and reconsider ideas and assumptions they held as true but it would be naive to think that everyone who clicked on to the page now thinks differently
5583939 look different dress differently worship in a different way and live in the same community as them
5583940 if it resulted in a smile to a stranger or a knock introducing yourself to your neighbor then id be very proud
5583941 ive still got a rather lengthy amount of time before i decide anything
5583942 the pendulum is swinging very heavily in the direction of it just being over ive never sat around and not gotten ready to head to florida well not in 23 or so years anyway so to me that will likely be the last real test for me and whether or not i want to put the time and effort into getting after it one more time
5583943 next i started thinking about the original plan of pitching the 2nd half of next season thing is that urgency just is not there i miss some things i didnt think i would and dont miss many things

5583945 mike told me to hang round the church steps and then an actor he didnt say who would turn up
5583946 when ewan came along i didnt recognise him it was before he was in trainspotting he was speaking in this impenetrable scottish accent he might have been an actor but he might have just been an annoying scotsman i just followed the motivation of the character
5583947 i was standing across the street ewan was wandering around shouting maggie maggie because archie was looking for his friend somebody leaned out of a window and told him to quiet down and he in character told them to fuck off
5583948 when the police arrived i went over and said im a director and were making a film the officer asked where the camera was i said we were improvising and he wasnt convinced so we had to take him back to our office and get others to corroborate the story
5583949 i always do if theres a chance of violence or if two characters are going to fuck

5583951 any political transition in pakistan will have no effect on pakistans nuclear assets because it has a very strong custodial control
5583952 the reality is that pakistans government exists on different levels one of the levels it exists and works at is in the control of its nuclear weapons
5583953 where it does not work is in providing effective services jobs education and health that people need
5583954 pakistans nuclear arsenal is in the hands of the army and the army is not changing hands so whatever the situation was before is largely what it will continue to be
5583955 if pakistan becomes a more fragile and even failing state then the nuclear assets will be everybodys problem internationally the best way to prevent that from happening is in strengthening the new governments ability to govern
5583956 competition brings out the best in products and the worst in people
5583957 the richest person is the one who is contented with what he has
5583958 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers
5583959 if the fact that they were showing up on problem lists for a year doesnt make them high risk i dont know what does
5583960 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
5583961 somebody could have picked up a box and looked at peppers if they wanted to but im not sure that would have been a high priority
5583962 it would require a big leap to think that salmonella in dried peppers could be related to problems in fresh chilies
5583963 because its venting properly itll maintain a temperature that will reduce the risk of explosion
5583964 now this whole musharraf excuse is behind us now people are going to be focusing on their performance
5583965 we believe that respect for the democratic and constitutional processes in that country is fundamental to pakistans future and its fight against terrorism
5583966 i am going with the satisfaction that whatever i have done was for the people and for the country i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5583967 it is very pleasing to know that musharraf is no more
5583968 he even tried to deceive the nation in his last address he was boasting about economic progress when life for people like us has become a hell
5583969 the government had been blaming musharraf for inflation power cuts and the weak economy and since now he has resigned we hope that the government will take steps to make our life better
5583970 his resignation clears the way for our government to get on with providing to the people of pakistan basic social services economic opportunities political security and law and order
5583971 its a huge challenge and they cannot face it individually its very important for them to work together and i think they know that
5583972 america wants some immediate decisions on fighting terrorism and i dont think they will be able to concentrate on that
5583973 on the other hand are the people of this country the business community and there too i dont see any new initiatives
5583974 the crimes of musharraf against the nation against the judiciary against democracy and against rule of law in the country cannot be forgiven by any party or individual
5583975 whatever one might say it may be difficult for the politicians to give him the indemnity
5583976 there were certain elements who were politicking with the economy and terrorism
5583977 saya sangat tertarik memikul jabatan ini bersama los angeles galaxy
5583978 saya menyadari begitu banyak tugas yang harus dikerjakan namun saya optimistis dengan dukungan manajemen klub dan pemain tim bakal mampu lolos kualifikasi ke babak play off target saya memenangi mls dan membentuk klub yang dapat dibanggakan para pendukungnya
5583979 but a few years ago i asked some students if they knew what watergate was and they said that was where monica lewinsky lived
5583980 it also prevents students from thinking that the way something is now is the way its always been
5583981 the green bay packers almost always had the same quarterback
5583982 i mean for as long as i can remember brett favre was the man there
5583983 its almost crazy to think he could retire or be with another team
5583984 harry potter could be a classmate playing on their quidditch team
5583985 i wish it was sort of true being on quidditch with him would be kind of cool
5583986 we say join the club it makes us feel old too
5583987 but if youve got a certain degree of wisdom and your body hasnt fallen apart yet you may be at the best time of your life
5583988 the military will continue to fight and the political government will continue to negotiate the negotiations have to continue as it is now an issue of saving pakistani society from the hands of the taliban
5583989 it has very fragile public support it doesnt want to lose that public support by going hard after the militants but at the same time it knows it must do so
5583990 this is a positive change but it is just the beginning
5583991 if the government ends these policies the taliban will stop their activities immediately
5583992 a group sharing thing where you share things in a group
5583993 go shooting with a girl so you can get your arms around her
5583994 avoid expressive music focus on ambient sounds and try creating tracks that are at least five minutes in length
5583995 see these shoes i bought them on the internet sight unseen never had a problem im a very good judge of quality miss walker i know how things are going to fit
5583996 if youre trying to drive me crazy i can walk from here
5583997 the opening of the redbridge centre could not have happened at a better time this being londons summer of cycling
5583998 one of my key ambitions as mayor is to see london become a real cycling city by encouraging the estimated 1 1 million londoners who own bikes but dont use them regularly to get back in the saddle
5583999 we have plans to launch a television channel very soon we want to give wider coverage to sociopolitical activities
5584000 we have a time tested content that we are sure will work in tamil nadu we definitely recognise reasonable potential to start a 24 hour news channel
5584001 the viewers will get more choices and the cinema industry benefits too with the tough competition among entertainment channels the price of movie rights is going up
5584002 fifty years have passed and dozens of armed groups have spurted across north east india and jammu and kashmir the afspa has manifestly failed to contain any insurgency instead it has become the symbol of oppression and repression
5584003 the afspa cannot address conflicts arising out of controversies such as the one relating to the amarnath shrine in jammu and kashmir but the actions of the armed forces and impunity enjoyed by them under the afspa can certainly alienate the people further
5584004 fire upon or otherwise use force even to the causing of death
5584005 unfortunately there are some folks who will lose their jobs
5584006 killing large swaths of sea life and causing hundreds of millions of dollars in damage

5584010 more than 200 works of art disappeared after the invasion of baghdad in 2003
5584011 two thirds of the monuments had been erected in tribute to military and political figures cherished by saddam his ruling baath party or for the 1980 1988 iran iraq war they are gone forever
5584012 we have put back the statues of al mansur and sheherazade in their places and we have restored a modern statue known as the mother
5584013 whenever a new regime arrives destroying the art of the past is in the soul of iraqis it has happened before after the fall of the monarchy and each time there was a revolution
5584014 simply dont understand that all this belongs to the countrys artistic heritage
5584015 the cameras are linked to the mmda head office where i could personally see the activities of my men whether they are involved in extortion or not
5584016 yup you feel it on edsa approaching cubao its freeflowing now
5584017 yes except the removal of the katipunan avenue u turn slot
5584018 this is against the law the agencys act could be considered theft
5584019 that would promote the long lost discipline of the drivers
5584020 cooperate with one another on things that are righteous and pious and good and do not cooperate with one another in aggression or sin thats a general directive
5584021 that seems to indicate to us that cooperating with anyone when we are not compromising our principles to achieve the common good is something that should be welcome
5584022 even after he the prophet received the revelation and became the prophet of allah still he kept praising that particular covenant and he said that if it is invoked today i will respond he didnt say he would have nothing to do with it since that was in the pre islamic days he simply still praised that kind of pact
5584023 i think one has to think twice before really being party to that
5584024 a muslim participating in a group like that might be misconstrued as approving of their homosexuals particular way of life which we all know is totally against what the quran and sunnah teach
5584025 one has to look into the given situation because there may be some organizations who might have a number of causes one of which is compatible with islam the other is not
5584026 is there a possibility of misunderstanding if you participate in that activity that you endorse other things that are not islamic or is the activity basically unique and specified like a coordinated demonstration for the rights of palestinians or for other things that affect muslims and non muslims alike
5584027 if there is a common cause that is for the benefit of the people and it is consistent with islam or even called for by islam even though there might be disagreement on some details and muslims just sit there and watch there are a number of prices to be paid
5584028 i would have felt much more assured if the statement that appears in their paper the nation of islam newspaper the final call still promoting the old ideas of god incarnating in fard muhammad and so on if as a show of goodwill and sincere intention that this at least should be removed from the paper thats going around the country
5584029 when cliffy b demoed gears of war for windows at e3 2007 to a throng of enthralled attendees he let drop at the end of his presentation that gears would be available for both windows xp and windows vista this year

5584039 im more convinced now than ever that were going to figure this out
5584040 i love pete but i just want pete to be wrong
5584041 it aint right that teams from houston and st louis come in here and hit more home runs than us i was warned about this place at this time of year but i hadnt seen it until now the ball is flying i mean that ball is flying
5584042 i looked it up and over the course of the last few years st louis and houston have beaten up on the us
5584043 that cant happen not two teams in our own division i aint going for that
5584044 were going to get this together im convinced of that were going to do it
5584045 were going to have the natural evolution of young men to men
5584046 volquez should do much the same johnny cueto is going to get better homer bailey could be here to be better and we could make a couple of off season pitching acquisitions
5584047 jay bruce talks to albert pujols and lance berkman about hitting
5584048 hes very inquisitive and berkman told him hell take control and be comfortable in a year joey votto is going to be better we have young guys like chris dickerson and hopefully we re sign jerry hairston jr and we hope he stays healthy
5584049 there are some area we want to improve and we have some veterans to help us improve
5584050 well have more stability on the bench brandon phillips is going to get better and our players will be more comfortable in the big leagues and feeling they belong
5584051 well have more speed better defense and we had a number of things that turned into distractions
5584052 we wont have nearly as many guys wondering who is going to be traded like ken griffey jr and adam dunn our bullpen should be more stable
5584053 young bill bray should be stronger next year and you have to think francisco cordero who gave up two runs in the ninth sunday will be better bronson arroyo will be better and you cant tell me that aaron harang is going to repeat this year 3 13 thats impossible harang will be harang

5584060 volquez is approaching a number of innings he has never pitched before in one year
5584061 thats why im encouraging the young guys to stay on the program to continue to run to learn how to get past the threshold then in the near future when were in the playoffs and world series theyll still be strong
5584062 the hardest thing to do is to convince a young guy to work hard now and hell appreciate it later
5584063 the older guys have been there and know what hard work does for them
5584064 he hasnt swung a bat in more than a week
5584065 were off today and hell come in and do some hitting it aint fair to ask him to come in and play right away were just getting him ready for chicago
5584066 it aint easy to miss a week and come in and hit
5584067 i know i couldnt i was in the reserves and missed two weeks without picking up a bat that was hard
5584068 if they start using instant replay to determine if balls are home runs or not are they going to go back and review some of the times home runs were missed
5584069 ive seen several guys who should have had home runs but the calls were missed
5584070 is that fair to them that guys now get the benefit of instant replay
5584071 yeah theyre going to give you a red bean bag and whenever you disagree with a balls and strikes call you throw it on the field and theyll review it
5584072 right now phelps is the most famous person in the world

5584075 to act as proxy diagnosticians by looking for evidence of particular deficits perhaps missing vital signs which may indicate other difficulties at home or with learning
5584076 children with learning difficulties and poor social skills will be diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder that may remain with them for the rest of their lives
5584077 if australia were to follow the racps recommendation to include adhd as a disability category eligible for additional support funding special education budgets for all australian educational jurisdictions would skyrocket
5584078 schools and educational systems will not be able to cope with the demand and as such each additional supported child will receive less
5584079 in the end children with significant disabilities cerebral palsy autism intellectual impairment will not receive the support they require and the segregation of students with high support needs will continue to increase
5584080 more educationally and fiscally responsible approach would be to provide targeted funding for which individual schools and teachers could apply to support their access to professional development in the area of inclusive educational practice
5584081 the 3d body scanner accurately extracts hundreds of measurements of the human body including volume in six seconds and removes a potential source of measurement error the human experimenter
5584082 it is widely believed that human beings are attracted to one another as a result of genotypic and phenotypic quality in other words their prospect as a mate who will yield higher quality offspring for the chooser
5584083 my previous research suggested that bodily symmetry is not necessarily what people attend to when they find someone attractive but nonetheless the physical cues that they do prefer may reveal an individuals underlying developmental quality i e degree of symmetry this new research identifies an explanation for the correlation between bodily shape and attractiveness your body proportions shape and stature are signals that conspicuously advertise your good development or health and therefore the degree to which you are a desirable reproductive partner in many species fewer departures from perfect symmetry are associated with good development health and reproductive success
5584084 it seems that because bodily asymmetries are too subtle to be seen with the naked eye evolution has instead engineered more conspicuous signals and displays such as broad shoulders curvy waist lines or smooth dance moves to indicate mate quality
5584085 theres things that we just cant say that we all know about
5584086 everyone knows if he gets excited for better or worse he can vamp out a little bit if you do have vampires about you in this modern day amongst you amongst us all theyre going through transformation publicly they kind of have to keep it contained and thats another layer of vulnerability for this guy he cant expose himself of course only thing i can say is that the private investigative element is that he because of his special abilities because he has superhuman powers vampire kind of powers hes able to take on cases that perhaps other people wouldnt hes able to pursue cases that may be unpursuable
5584087 i think theres a lot of things in this genre and in this sort of era of storytelling that are analogous or metaphorical to stuff and certainly pertinent to whats going on in todays society with vanity the thing is all this stuff a lot of this stuff that we talk about a lot of it is sort of drummed up and kept alive by the media and by us by our demand for magazines and some of this but its also a lot of it was born from the industry that were actually working in so theres a lot of interesting contradictions but as an actor i look at the show and this is a story about this vampire mick st john
5584088 he fell in love with this beautiful woman back in the 40 and 50s he married this woman and she made him she gave him this thing that she thought was a gift but to him was a curse so the fact that he is 90 years old and hes sort of ruggedly handsome the fact that hes still youthful and his skin is still youthful and his eyes are still bright is something that he struggles with so its not actually something he ever really gets to enjoy were going to present lots of stuff i think along those lines that i think youre going to find interesting
5584089 ive been kind of obsessed with the genre since i first discovered it since i could first get my head around it i discovered anne rice when i was sort of late teens i read the first five or six books of the vampire chronicles twice actually which was a little obsessive i loved her character development i learned so much about the mythology of vampires through her storytelling and some of which she sort of took dramatic license with but a lot is authentic also i grew up with in australia i grew up with american tv and american cinema because we didnt really have that much of our own so i grew up with all of the films that you guys did lost boys was a huge film for me when that was made and the hunger was also something that i really loved so yeah i have always sort of wanted to play a vampire
5584090 all i will say is that my client maintains his innocence
5584091 we were informed this morning of the news from antigua and we are pleased at how the investigation is progressing

5584115 its hard to deal with now because its not like were game planning what were going to do on third downs but i still think that makes an impact on the outcome of these preseason games
5584116 its always tough when you get the ball at the 1 yard line initially we ran the ball the guys up front pounded it and kenny watson had some nice runs we strung together good plays and capped it with a touchdown

5584142 lo que suceda en los pr ximos d as y meses determinar el futuro de las relaciones entre estados unidos y rusia pero del mismo modo mi opini n personal es que tienen que haber consecuencias para las acciones que rusia ha tomado contra un estado soberano
5584143 acuso al gobierno ruso de adoptar una pol tica de limpieza tnica y puedo probarlo con organizaciones internacionales que ya est n dando testimonio de lo que digo y recibimos 1 400 denuncias de ataques brutales asesinatos violaciones e internaci n de personas en violaci n de la convenci n de ginebra y del derecho humanitario internacional
5584144 como ya he dicho de acuerdo con el c digo de las naciones unidas estamos intentando imponer la paz a georgia que empez la agresi n consideramos que esta t ctica es muy efectiva y es la nica posible perm tanme recordarles que en la historia hemos visto muchos ejemplos de pacificaci n del agresor de esta manera los pa ses occidentales lo hicieron hace 70 a os y conocen las tr gicas consecuencias de eso quiero decir la lecci n del tratado de munich de 1938
5584145 rusia invadi un estado vecino soberano y amenaza a un gobierno democr tico electo por su pueblo
5584146 entendemos que el actual liderazgo de georgia es un proyecto especial de estados unidos pero un d a estados unidos tendr que elegir entre defender su prestigio por sobre un proyecto o una sociedad real que requiera acciones conjuntas
5584147 quiero dialogar con los rusos quiero que se retiren del territorio georgiano lo m s r pido posible y me interesa mantener buenas relaciones con rusia pero en el siglo xxi las naciones no invaden otras naciones
5584148 estamos sumamente decepcionados este informe aparentemente consiente el uso de la fuerza letal en una situaci n en la que los soldados no pod an y lo admiten estar seguros de lo que ten an frente creemos que hab a fundamentos suficientes para que se dieran cuenta que estaban frente a periodistas esto nos pone en una posici n en la que los periodistas no pueden levantar una c mara en presencia de los soldados israel es sin correr peligro de que les disparen eso es inaceptable y hablaremos con las autoridades israel es sobre c mo podemos mejorar la seguridad de nuestros periodistas en el futuro
5584149 el informe israel sobre el asesinato de fadel ha suscitado temores entre los periodistas palestinos que cubren el conflicto con israel en gaza entre los palestinos y los israel es en la franja de gaza sobre la misi n ustedes saben la misi n de cubrir y filmar y hemos estado escuchando comentarios de todos los otros colegas de que ya no est n seguros de sus vidas tras un informe como este que deja en claro que el simple hecho de levantar una c mara en la calle en un campo de refugiados o cerca de la frontera puede poner la vida de una persona en peligro
5584150 en este incidente del 16 de abril seis civiles fueron asesinados con proyectiles tipo flechette un arma ilegal que no deber a ser utilizada en estas condiciones en la franja de gaza y una de estas seis v ctimas era un periodista por todas estas razones era de esperarse que el ej rcito iniciara y dirigiera una investigaci n minuciosa sobre este caso pero decidi no hacerlo la falta de responsabilidad en este caso se refleja en la falta de responsabilidad en la muerte de miles de palestinos que fueron asesinados en los territorios ocupados

5584164 esos cambios tropiezan a cada instante con poderosos obst culos obst culos que colocan en el camino grupos econ micos poderes transnacionales viejos h bitos pol ticos y en general un pasado cargado de negatividad de revanchismo y la voluntad de garantizarse a como d lugar que las cosas sigan siendo como eran
5584165 la facultad del parlamento de habilitar al jefe del estado para dictar decretos con fuerza de ley siempre estuvo consagrada en el ordenamiento constitucional venezolano y la ejercieron los gobiernos en diferentes etapas de nuestra historia no es una novedad y menos a n un golpe de estado o una violaci n de la carta magna como algunos lo plantean
5584166 lo que sucede es que ahora se legisla con otro signo con otra orientaci n pero los 26 decretos leyes aprobados por ch vez en el marco de la habilitaci n que le otorg la asamblea nacional son inobjetables la otorg con la mayor a requerida la representaci n popular y la ejerce un presidente electo por el pueblo
5584167 va en el mismo dise o de los proyectos de 2001 con las leyes habilitantes que estaban destinadas a una mayor injerencia del estado y adem s lesionar la propiedad privada
5584168 aqu el problema no es el control del estado de las instituciones es la confiscaci n la ocupaci n de los espacios sociales y por eso se habla de un neototalitarismo que es distinto a la dictadura pol tica
5584169 que el mandatario venezolano tras decretar la semana pasada leyes que fueron rechazadas en el referendo de 2007 sobre una reforma constitucional inici nuevos pasos para implementar el socialismo en el pa s y lograr la reelecci n continua
5584170 el presidente de la rep blica con la participaci n del tribunal supremo de justicia han desconocido la constituci n vigente han pisoteado el estado de derecho han impedido el derecho a la participaci n han aplicado una sistem tica estrategia de desinformaci n han actuado de manera arbitraria ilegal y contra el inter s y la opini n del pa s
5584171 26 leyes que el gobierno aprob en las ltimas horas aprueban las mismas cosas y peores a las que el pueblo venezolano dijo no el 2 de diciembre
5584172 because the satellites fuel contains the toxic chemical hydrazine it is possible that the reentry of the satellite could pose a public health threat if pieces of it fall into populated areas the risk of health effects related to the satellite is considered to be low however cdc is encouraging health officials and clinicians to review information about the health effects related to hydrazine to prepare in case their communities are affected by satellite debris
5584173 we agreed that hydrazine could be a threat but how large of a threat was based on dod casualty estimates that were given to us there was not enough information to accurately model ourselves out of an abundance of caution cdc issued a health alert network message providing basic information about hydrazine which was taken mostly from existing public web pages with hydrazine information
5584174 the satellite has hazardous materials on board that could pose immediate hazards to people if they come in contact with the material specifically the satellite contains fuel and metal containers that are considered hazardous materials and could survive entry intact any debris should be considered potentially hazardous and should not be touched handled or moved
5584175 first responders should secure a perimeter and control access around any debris do not pick up any debris notify your local emergency manager of its location immediately the concerns are similar to those encountered after the space shuttle columbia entered the atmosphere however this craft has far less hazardous materials and is much smaller in size
5584176 dod was the lead agency for the satellite re entry and provided all supporting agencies with the details involved with the spacecraft any additional comments would need to come from dod
5584177 the objective of the satellite intercept mission was to minimize the possibility of injury to humans from the hydrazine fuel tank enclosed in the satellite the likelihood of debris falling on a populated area on the ground was remote however norad continues to monitor the debris field in order to predict the possibility of debris falling within north america
5584178 a surprising number of the shuttles 64 tanks and pressure vessels survived the breakup and landed intact
5584179 more than 5 400 metric tons of materials are predicted to have survived reentry with no reported casualties
5584180 uncontrolled at the time of reentry during operation burnt frosts period of planning and execution cords listed several significant reentries that were projected to occur in this same timeframe 9
5584181 the fact that there has not yet been a significant human health impact is a matter of good fortune
5584182 if the tank made it to the earths surface it would have a 3 5 chance of affecting a person however i estimate that it was highly unlikely that it would make it to the surface of the earth though i cannot quantify that probability i believe the most likely eventuality was that the tank would break up in the atmosphere
5584183 the risk of health effects related to this satellite is considered to be low
5584184 weeks of intense work paved way for stratcoms direct hit
5584185 i think it was in middle school and i had an english teacher who said id never be successful
5584186 i feel grateful ive been in an era with such a great swimmer thats been my highlight i could care less about my swims i think phelps winning eight gold medals is pretty impressive its amazing
5584187 the level of achievement that hes done here is phenomenal in my opinion well never see it again i just dont think that it can be emulated or beaten in this day and age when sport is so competitive
5584188 over the past few years ive never seen him change which is nice hes done a wonderful job hes an incredible racer so good for him for what hes achieved hes a nice guy just a good bloke
5584189 i saw a bunch of other athletes walking around too i came up to rafael nadal because i wanted to meet him i saw dirk nowitzki and roger federer and some other guys too it was pretty cool
5584190 i looked up and theyre both wearing fake gold medals around their necks and they were just going crazy
5584191 after the games now im taking some time off and i just want to have fun with my friends
5584192 i heard from baltimore ravens stadium that like 70 000 people are going to watch the finish of the 400 medley relay tonight on the video screen
5584193 i heard at the cincinnati reds game yesterday they had my 100 butterfly on the big screen and i heard it was announced at the yankees game people from all over are telling me how crazy it is how theyll be out to eat and the tv is on and its turned to swimming
5584194 right now its a work in progress my goal is to raise the sport of swimming as high as i can get it i dont want this to be an every four year sport i want to get as many people as i can talking about swimming
5584195 recently an extreme form of linguistic determinism has been revived which claims that counting words are needed for children to develop concepts of numbers above three
5584196 however our study of aboriginal children suggests that we have an innate system for recognizing and representing numerosities the number of objects in a set and that the lack of a number vocabulary should not prevent us from doing numerical tasks that do not require number words
5584197 in our tasks we couldnt for example ask questions such as
5584198 do these two sets have the same number of objects
5584199 thus basic numerical concepts do indeed appear to depend on an innate mechanism this may help explain why children in numerate cultures with developmental dyscalculia find it so difficult to learn arithmetic although they have plenty of formal and informal opportunities to learn to count with words and do arithmetic the innate mechanism on which skilled arithmetic is based may have developed atypically

5584204 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obamas varying position on the surge in iraq
5584205 first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure this was back when supporting americas efforts entailed serious risk
5584206 this is a particular concern when a candidate has a short thin record on the issues as in the case of sen obama

5584233 en el congreso la derecha tiene mayor a la candidatura de lugo cont con el respaldo del partido liberal radical aut ntico plra de ideolog a de derecha y representante de terratenientes
5584234 ellos van a defender sus intereses y no van a aceptar ninguna ocupaci n de tierras ni reducci n de los latifundios
5584235 lugo est en una posici n m s de izquierda ya sali a decir que cree que las ocupaciones de tierras son leg timas como ltima instancia en la negociaci n pol tica y respalda la lucha de los campesinos por una reforma agraria integral sin embargo creemos que se va a encontrar con muchas contradicciones va a tener que asumir algunos acuerdos con la burgues a por ello el movimiento social se est preparando para apoyar las posiciones del presidente lugo y llegado el momento presionar para que se concreten los cambios
5584236 ni bien gan lugo los compa eros se organizaron y empezaron a ocupar tierras especialmente en el norte del pa s donde hay una zona muy conflictiva y donde el movimiento campesino est m s organizado e ideologizado
5584237 el an lisis realizado por nuestro movimiento es que este no es un momento estrat gico para presionar no se puede presionar al gobierno saliente que no va ofrecer garant as ni soluciones y tampoco al entrante al que hay que darle un poco de tiempo para ver si efectivamente cumple con lo que ha prometido
5584238 creo si que los compa eros en el interior est n preparados para ocupar como una medida de fuerza que me parece correcto y creo que el movimiento campesino est lo suficientemente maduro pol ticamente para tratar primero de agotar las instancias institucionales para despu s en caso de que no se cumpla con lo prometido comenzar a presionar
5584239 tambi n hay una presi n sobre todo de los medios de comunicaci n para crear en la opini n p blica una opini n desfavorable al gobierno de lugo creando temor y miedo
5584240 cuando el gobierno act e tocando intereses pol ticos fuertes la oposici n e incluso el partido liberal integrante de la coalici n de gobierno va a presionar para defender sus privilegios van a tratar de desestabilizar sectores para defender esos privilegios
5584241 y es b sicamente por eso que creo que mucho del peso pol tico que va a tener lugo depender de si puede llevar a cabo una reforma agraria integral
5584242 hay casi un mill n de empleados p blicos una clase media que vive directa o indirectamente de los recursos del estado
5584243 esas estructuras represivas siguen existiendo y lamentablemente ser dificil romperlas hoy d a los compa eros siguen siendo torturados en las c rceles del interior siguen siendo secuestrados por la polic a est n presos en situaci n ilegal siendo ocurriendo asesinatos pol ticos el a o pasado nos asesinaron a un compa ero y en lo que va de este a o han asesinados otros dos compa eros del movimiento y esto en un marco de democracia de elecciones y de libertad de expresi n
5584244 por sobre todo la acci n del nuevo gobierno estar focalizada en que los ministerios sean eficaces en sus gesti n que la salud la educaci n funcionen hay que recordar que en 61 a os en el poder el partido colorado ha creado una maquinaria impresionante de asistencial smo usando los recursos del estado en su beneficio y distribuyendo empleos p blicos y van a defender sus privilegios
5584245 espero que ojala se cumpla con lograr que los servicios del estado funcionen debidamente eso ser a un buen primer paso
5584246 en los ltimos a os el movimiento social se ha fortalecido ha logrado parar las privatizaciones la ley antiterrorista y fundamentalmente es el movimiento campesino el que m s capacidad de movilizaci n tiene creo que los compa eros del movimiento social est n conscientes de la necesidad de defender la institucionalidad en este momento
5584247 se logr acumular bastante fuerza y constituirse en el movimiento que present y apoy la candidatura de fernando lugo despu s en el trabajo se lograron acordar algunos proyectos program ticos lamentablemente en las discusiones program ticas en la coalici n fueron mimetizadas
5584248 ahora el gran desaf o es hacer un buen trabajo en los ministerios lograr una buena gesti n pero sin negligenciar el movimiento social de base que dio apoyo y crecimiento a todo esto
5584249 tomaron distancia del movimiento social concentr ndose sus cuadros en ocupar los lugares del gobierno y eso no permiti que el propio partido se dinamice
5584250 el gran desaf o seguir creciendo con la base seguir formando y construyendo el poder popular que es lo nico que nos va a garantizar un movimiento social ideologizado que nos va a permitir en el futuro y creo que es v lido para toda am rica latina poner freno a pol ticas neoliberales capitalistas para mi la nica forma concretar un cambio social estructural es constuyendo el poder popular
5584251 never mind you probably werent going to help me with my car anyway
5584252 era necesario quedar bien con el auspiciador y mostrar la camiseta la noche antes lo conversamos junto a mi compa ero y al boliviano y quedamos en eso un chileno se escapar a para mostrarse y el otro buscar a terminar la carrera

5584254 estamos ac para seguir avanzando en la recuperaci n de nuestros recursos nacionalizaci n de las empresas
5584255 si me ratifican con m s de un 54 voy a convocar a todas las autoridades para buscar consensos y que el pueblo pueda aprobar una constituci n pol tica del estado boliviano que es un tema pendiente
5584256 el triunfo de la revoluci n democr tica de bolivia y del pueblo boliviano est dedicado a todos los pueblos revolucionarios de latinoam rica y el mundo
5584257 por primera vez en esta historia del pueblo boliviano hubo un referendo revocatorio y cont con la participaci n masiva de todo nuestro pueblo
5584258 no solo elige a sus candidatos adem s de eso los ratifica o los revoca
5584259 estamos ac para seguir avanzando en la recuperaci n de nuestros recursos nacionalizaci n de las empresas fundamental en la retoma de las empresas del estado
5584260 la participaci n que hoy se vio es para unir a los distintos sectores campo y ciudad y esa unidad se har juntando la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado con los estatutos auton micos respetando las normas existentes
5584261 pese a la alianza de la derecha fascista racista y algunos medios de comunicaci n
5584262 m s del 90 por ciento de los medios est n contra el proceso de cambio por lo tanto contra el pueblo esos periodistas est n contra m s del 65 por ciento de bolivianas y bolivianos que le dicen s al cambio
5584263 este gobierno insensible totalitario masista incapaz le niega el desarrollo al pueblo y s lo busca concentrar el poder y convertirnos en mendigo de l sigue siendo un pretexto de la dictadura masista el atender a los ancianos con el idh la verdadera intenci n es destruir la autonom a departamental
5584264 porque eso es autonom a democracia participativa real y es una forma de llevar el poder de decisi n a la gente
5584265 estamos impulsando la creaci n de la agencia tributaria departamental para contar con una entidad que defienda nuestros recursos de forma eficiente y transparente que permitir la ejecuci n de un fondo solidario de apoyo a otros departamentos
5584266 lo confiscado por el neopopulismo masista debe ser recuperado y eso no se negocia
5584267 im a professional business manager i have a staff of more than a dozen i have worked for many high profile actors musicians and multi million dollar corporations why would i steal from rihanna i showed her all the paperwork and tried to explain to her the circumstances but she wouldnt listen she called me all sorts of horrible names and stormed off i now feel compelled to share with the world the background story as i will not allow my name to be slandered
5584268 def jam doesnt fund rihanna properly so marc uses the money rihanna makes from third party endorsements and from tours to fund her album and music videos
5584269 since 2005 rihanna has been sponsored by the likes of jc penny samsung covergirl secret venus breeze etc and has gone on two major tours most recently label mate kanye wests
5584270 her record label def jam has put out 3 albums in a time span of 2 years a lot of that was orchestrated through her management rebel one it was never def jams intention to release so many albums back to back but marc jordan found loop holes and ways to make it happen a lot of the money rihanna made was through her endorsements between covergirl cosmetics samsung notice that majority of rihannas videos have a cell phone in it
5584271 after the release of rihanna and teairra mari def jam had the intention to drop both acts because their album sales were not successful
5584272 this brought the hype back for rihanna in the companys new york office the majority of the official s o s video was funded by samsung because the record label was only willing to put up a small amount once s o s picked up digitally and at radio def jam agreed to fund the rest of her album jordan instantly got a video shot to unfaithful he negotiated with video director anthony mandler to drop his price and would be given more videos from rihanna in return
5584273 then they shot we ride which was an extremely cheap video to create break it off was released as a third album but again def jam was unhappy with the sales of her album a girl like me and refused to shoot a video
5584274 at this point rihanna was opening up for the pussy cat dolls in europe she was making 30 000 a show but she didnt see any of that money because it was needed to fund her next album
5584275 when the albums first week numbers came in at less than 150 000 the label was shocked
5584276 jordan was noticing that dont stop the music was picking up so he persuaded the label to support it at radio in the u
5584277 take a bow was bought through her money the video was created with her money and so is her most recent video and single disturbia the label didnt even want to pay a dime for anything close to 750 000 was spent on those two songs alone and now she expects to see money in her account
5584278 all of it was spent on making her as big as she is now
5584279 just to be able to walk down your local grocery store and just see your face on the packages
5584280 you heard it here first were going to win three gold medals
5584281 me qued en racing para formar un equipo protagonista y para desarrollar un proyecto tengo el apoyo de la dirigencia adem s mi salida ser a un problema m s para el club

5584283 nos falta ganar por eso vamos a hacer un excelente partido contra independiente tenemos que mostrar juego y orgullo para ganar este tipo de encuentros
5584284 el escenario es el mismo del torneo pasado y empatamos 0 a 0 en el clausura ahora tenemos que ganar
5584285 fue un partido complicado era para un empate pero fallamos y eso nos cost la derrota
5584286 es que tratamos bien la pelota hacemos buenas jugadas pero no creamos situaciones nos falta profundidad y claridad en los ltimos 20 metros y nos caemos cuando nos hacen un gol
5584287 i did not like cvs caremarks number i thought that caremark did not do well i think the company itself would agree with that i also believe that walgreen has decided to stop its willy nilly growth and get more measured in its growth
5584288 people should go back over that google interview because i think eric gave you a longer term view right now were caught in the miasma of the shorter term view and its really killing people eric gave you a multiyear view and im really thrilled that he did
5584289 puedo decir cu ndo comenzar el nuevo a o pero no la fecha exacta de la retirada de nuestras tropas de la zona en conflicto

5584703 most men learn at a relatively young age that it isnt enough to find a female that they are compatible with and with whom they get along well no if the female detects that her man doesnt find her absolutely sexually irresistible she will move on to one who does for it is her sexuality by which the female rules over the man and if this power is less than omnipotent over a particular man the female feels threatened fears she is likely to lose him to more attractive competitors and thus cuts her losses and tries again hence males know that if they are to have any chance at being kept by a female it is after all females who do the choosing and are in control of these matters then they should only pursue those who they find most sexually appealing and just hope that once they eventually get to know her better she doesnt prove to be crazy a meth addict etc so if you cant attract a man with your sexuality youre screwed but as ive demonstrated its the fault of your own sex anyway so you deserve it

5584709 he that despised moses law died without mercy under two or three witnesses of how much sorer punishment suppose ye shall he be thought worthy who hath trodden under foot the son of god and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing and hath done despite unto the spirit of grace

5584753 with a regard to true theology a more ignorant people never lived than the present so called christian world
5584754 should you ask why we differ from other christians as they are called it is simply because they are not christians as the new testament defines christianity
5584755 the religion of god embraces every fact that exists in all the wide arena of nature while the religions of men consist of theory devoid of fact or of any true principle of guidance hence the professing christian world are like a ship upon a boisterous ocean without rudder compass or pilot and are tossed hither and thither by every wind of doctrine
5584756 the time came when paganism was engrafted into christianity and at last christianity was converted into paganism rather than converting the pagans
5584757 brother taylor has just said that the religions of the day were hatched in hell the eggs were laid in hell hatched on its borders and kicked on to the earth
5584758 we talk about christianity but it is a perfect pack of nonsense the devil could not invent a better engine to spread his work than the christianity of the nineteenth century
5584759 what are christians ignorant yes as ignorant of the things of god as the brute beast
5584760 what does the christian world know about god nothing why so far as the things of god are concerned they are the veriest of fools they know neither god nor the things of god
5584761 and who is there that acknowledges gods hand you may wander east west north and south and you cannot find it in any church or government on the earth except the church of jesus christ of latter day saints
5584762 the whole system of christianity is a failure so far as stemming the tide of wickedness and corruption is concerned or turning men from their evil ways to living lives of righteousness before god our heavenly father i would rather preach the gospel to a people who have not got any religion than i would to a people who have got a great deal of religion you take the catholic world what impression can the truths of the gospel make upon them as a people scarcely any impression at all why because they are satisfied with what they have got which we know is an error and which is not calculated to stem the tide of wickedness and corruption which floods the world it never will convert the world to god or his kingdom or convey a knowledge of god unto the children of men and it is life eternal to know him the living and true god the christianity of the period will never make the people acquainted with god in the world it will never bring them to eternal life as spoken of in the scriptures it is an utter impossibility in the first place they do not know anything about god and in the second place they apparently dont want to know anything about him they have reared a superstructure in the earth which is false it is and has been a tremendous imposture to the children of men some have come out of it to a certain extent seeing its incongruity and yet they have floundered in the dark not knowing what was right not having that knowledge of god which is necessary to obtain eternal life they have been tossed to and fro and carried about by every wind of doctrine without being able to find the truth many who have thus been foundering are honest people but the so called system of christianity is not only an error and a snare but is a monstrous iniquity fastened upon the children of men throughout the earth no wonder that people become infidel the inconsistent and incongruous nature of the system is enough to make any being who reasons infidel it was time the truth should be revealed it was time for the lord to restore the everlasting gospel for men were blind darkness covered the earth even gross darkness the minds of the people in regard to religious subjects perhaps a darker time was never known since the earth began its revolutions around the sun from what i have read and from what experience i have had in life and the intelligence i possess i make bold to give my testimony that the darkest period the world ever saw was when this work first commenced when it was made known from heaven to joseph smith it was no darker here perhaps than in any other part of the world but it was just as dark in christian countries as in any pagan country so far as true religion and the light of heaven were concerned
5584763 q after the church of christ fled from the earth to heaven what was left
5584764 all other churches are entirely destitute of all authority from god and any person who receives baptism or the lords supper from their hands highly offend god for he looks upon them as the most corrupt of all people the only persons among all nations kindreds tongues and people who have authority from jesus christ to administer any gospel ordinance are those called and authorized among the latter day saints
5584765 this class of men calling themselves christian uniting with the various forms of the pagan religion adopting many of their ceremonies and institutions became very popular and finally some of the pagans embraced christianity and were placed as it were upon the throne and what they termed christianity became very popular indeed how long has this order of things existed this dreadful apostasy this class of people that pronounced themselves zion or christians without any of the characteristics of zion it has existed for some sixteen or seventeen centuries it has spread itself and grown and gone into the four quarters of the earth it is the great ecclesiastical power that is spoken of by the revelator john and called by him the most corrupt and most wicked of all the powers of the earth under the name of spiritual babylon or in other words babel which signifies confusion this great and corrupt power is also represented by john as presenting a golden cup to the nations full of all manner of filthiness and abominations
5584766 this great apostasy commenced about the close of the first century of the christian era and it has been waxing worse and worse from then until now
5584767 but as there has been no christian church on the earth for a great many centuries past until the present century the people have lost sight of the pattern that god has given according to which the christian church should be established and they have denominated a great variety of people christian churches because they profess to be but there has been a long apostasy during which the nations have been cursed with apostate churches in great abundance and they are represented in the revelations of st
5584768 who is babylon i have already explained that babylon is a great power that should be in the earth under the name of a church a woman that generally represents a church full of blasphemy these churches are scattered over the wide face of the earth and this is called babylon another angel is to follow the one that brings the gospel after it has been sufficiently preached and proclaim the downfall of this great and corrupt power in the earth
5584769 the worshipers of baal were far more consistent than apostate christendom for they had a faint hope that baal would hear and answer them but modern divines have no expectation that their god will say anything to them or to their followers baals followers cried from morning until evening for him to give unto them a miraculous manifestation in the presence of elijah but to even expect a supernatural manifestation or revelation now is considered by modern religionists as the greatest absurdity baals worshipers therefore with all their absurdities approached nearer the religion of heaven in some of their expectations than those who falsely call themselves christians
5584770 we have already proved in the previous numbers of this series that immediately after the first century the whole earth became corrupted by the great
5584771 christians those poor miserable priests brother brigham was speaking about some of them are the biggest whoremasters there are on the earth
5584772 i do not wish to say anything in relation to other forms of religion i do not know that it is necessary that i should do so but no thinking man can admit that christianity so called i call it a false christianity untrue to its name satisfies the wants of humanity at the present time it is not a religion that satisfies
5584773 after the church of jesus christ of latter day saints was organized there were only two churches upon the earth they were known respectively as the church of the lamb of god and babylon the various organizations which are called churches throughout christendom though differing in their creeds and organizations have one common origin they all belong to babylon
5584774 i said then and i say now may the lord give me such periods of darkness as were enjoyed by the apostles and saints of old in preference to the gospel blaze of modern christianity the ancient doctrine and power will unlock the mysteries of heaven and pour forth that gospel light knowledge and truth of which the heavens are full and which has been poured out in every generation when prophets appeared among the children of men but the gospel of modern christendom shuts up the lord and stops all communication with him i want nothing to do with such a gospel i would rather prefer the gospel of the dark ages so called
5584775 there is a theory in the human mind i will say with a certain school of modern philosophers to satisfy themselves and justify their infidelity the bent and tendency of their inclinations is that way but it is probable that the crude undefined devices and erroneous notions and ideas of modern christianity touching the deity leads to this infidelity as much as anything else the advocates of christianity are in a great measure to blame when we begin to scan the teachings and enquire into the views of the leading divines of modern times and examine their articles of faith and their discipline the teachings of different christian denominations on the subject of the deity we do not wonder that the reflecting careful thinker should repudiate their crude notions
5584776 nothing less than a complete apostasy from the christian religion would warrant the establishment of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints
5584777 this view of god as an incorporeal immaterial bodiless partless passionless being is now and has been from the days of the great apostasy from god and christ in the second and third centuries the doctrine of deity generally accepted by apostate christendom the simple doctrine of the christian godhead set forth in the new testament is corrupted by the meaningless jargon of these creeds and their explanations and the learned who profess a belief in them are wandering in the darkness of the mysticisms of the old pagan philosophies
5584778 the false and corrupt institutions and still more corrupt practices of christendom have had a downward tendency in the generations of man for many centuries the overthrow of those ancient degenerate races is a type of that which now awaits the nations call christian or in other words the great whore that sitteth upon many waters
5584779 a self suggesting interpretation of history indicates that there has been a great departure from the way of salvation as laid down by the savior a universal apostasy from the church of christ from the facts already stated it is evident that the church was literally driven from the earth in the first ten centuries immediately following the ministry of christ the authority of the holy priesthood was lost among men and no human power could restore it
5584780 the significance and importance of the great apostasy as a condition precedent to the re establishment of the church in modern times is obvious if the alleged apostasy of the primitive church was not a reality the church of jesus christ of latter day saints is not the divine institution its name proclaims
5584781 for hundreds of years the world was wrapped in a veil of spiritual darkness until there was not one fundamental truth belonging to the place of salvation that was not in the year 1820 so obscured by false tradition and ceremonies borrowed from paganism as to make it unrecognizable or else it was entirely denied joseph smith declared that in the year 1820 the lord revealed to him that all the christian churches were in error teaching for commandments the doctrines of men
5584782 this is the only true church this is not a church this is the church of jesus christ there are churches of men all over the land and they have great cathedrals synagogues and other houses of worship running into the hundreds of millions of dollars they are churches of men they teach the doctrines of men combined with the philosophies and ethics and other ideas and ideals that men have partly developed and partly found in sacred places and interpreted for themselves
5584783 presumptuous and blasphemous are they who purport to baptize bless marry or perform other sacraments in the name of the lord while in fact lacking the specific authorization
5584784 the traditions of the elders as is also the case with the traditions of an apostate christendom are wholly devoid of the least scintilla of inspiration
5584785 what of seventies who are they and how do they fit into the eternal scheme of things that their mission and ministry is unknown among the cults of christendom is one of the great evidences of the apostate darkness that engulfs those who call themselves by the name of him who called seventies to stand as especial witnesses of that very name
5584786 thus the signs of the times include the prevailing apostate darkness in the sects of christendom and in the religious world in general false churches false prophets false worship breeding as they do a way of life that runs counter to the divine will all these are signs of the times
5584787 what is the church of the devil in our day and where is the seat of her power it is all of the systems both christian and non christian that perverted the pure and perfect gospel it is communism it is islam it is buddhism it is modern christianity in all its parts
5584788 as with other doctrines and ordinances apostate substitutes of the real thing are found both among pagans and supposed christians
5584789 when inquiring and scientific minds delve into the narrow and bigoted creeds of the apostate sects of christendom it is not surprising that they rebel against those dogmas falsely set forth as the tenets of true religion
5584790 christianity is the religion of the christians hence true and acceptable christianity is found among the saints who have the fullness of the gospel and a perverted christianity holds sway among the so called christians of apostate christendom
5584791 the only real superiority of the apostate sects of christendom over their more openly pagan counterparts is the fact that the christian sects though rejecting the doctrines ordinances and powers of the gospel have nonetheless preserved many of the ethical teachings of christ and the apostles
5584792 and virtually all the millions of apostate christendom have abased themselves before the mythical throne of a mythical christ whom they vainly suppose to be a spirit essence who is incorporeal uncreated immaterial and three in one with the father and holy spirit
5584793 gnosticism is one of the great pagan philosophies which antedated christ and the christian era and which was later commingled with pure christianity to form the apostate religion that has prevailed in the world since the early days of that era
5584794 in large part the worship of apostate christendom is performed in ignorance as much so as was the worship of the athenians who bowed before the unknown god and to whom paul said
5584795 for instance the creeds of apostate christendom teach untruths about god and the scriptures say that those who accept these creeds have inherited lies
5584796 pagan tribal gods were the creation of the imaginations of apostate peoples just as the creeds and apostate views of god which prevail in modern christendom are the result of forsaking the truth
5584797 mormonism is christianity christianity is mormonism they are one and the same and they are not to be distinguished from each other in the minutest detail mormons are true christians their worship is the pure unadulterated christianity authored by christ and accepted by peter james and john and all the ancient saints
5584798 the gods of christendom for instance are gods who were created by men in the creeds of an apostate people there is little profit or peace in serving them and certainly there is no salvation available through them
5584799 it is not the things we do in life that we regret on our death bed it is the things we do not find your passion and follow it and if there is anything that i have learned in life you will not find that passion in things and you will not find that passion in money because the more things and the more money you have the more you will just look around and use that as the metric and there will always be someone with more your passion must come from the things that fuel you from the inside that passion will be grounded in people it will be grounded in the relationships you have with people and what they think of you when your time comes
5584800 we would be fools if we didnt look after ourselves
5584801 we are trying to get a balance between trying to keep council tax low and trying to avoid the high cost of landfill
5584802 we need to benefit from increases in the market and not suffer too much from a downturn authorities need to balance the risk to the local taxpayer while contractors will write in their own profit margin but a fixed price on profits is the more common model as far as i am aware
5584803 five years ago it was a very uncertain market as to whether you could get anyone to take them
5584804 but now the price of metals is going through the roof i think that typically councils are locked into very long contracts indeed and that is a very real problem
5584805 some of them will include provisions for sharing profits but i suspect a lot will not i am saying to my people that i do not want to get into any long term contracts at all nothing over five years
5584806 the real difference is the margin theres enough margin there now to justify the investment another factor is the demand for food grade recycled plastic
5584807 we anticipate this price continuing to rise in relation to oil prices and also increasing demand from manufacturers to expand the ranges of plastics collected
5584808 there is a lot of value in the material we are treating as rubbish maybe calling it waste is the wrong phrase we should be calling it resources in the wrong place
5584809 theres been a strong growth in the sector its probably a combination of an increase in the value of the waste and the ability to benefit from economies of scale the value of things like plastic bottles has gone up significantly because of the cost of raw materials oil in particular
5584810 its becoming more of a factor for people the pricing of carbon is still in its early days but people are becoming aware
5584811 i wouldnt want to see scarcity as the main driver but looking forward we are going to have to do something about using materials as many times as we can paper fibres can for example be used seven times if we use them just the once weve missed out
5584812 a lot of councils dont recycle the plastic waste because there havent been processing facilities we think by building plants you encourage more councils to recycle
5584813 the uk is the land of milk and honey for recycling and environmental technology
5584814 obviously it makes us more competitive with virgin resin which is a product of the oil refracting process
5584815 all the recycled alternatives have found themselves much more competitive
5584816 the past two years have been great for us and our investors theyve been great for the environment in general
5584817 we take bottles from the kerbside sort them shred them wash them and return them back to food grade resin which can be used to make bottles again
5584818 we are a small but important step in the right direction i really believe in it its the way we need to go as a community and a society
5584819 they were the closest to us before the war and now they are the most frightening enemy
5584820 it feels like your own brother has cut off your head
5584821 after what happened it should be clear that they should have self determination
5584822 the reality is that for 15 years at least south ossetia and abkhazia have been independent in fact

5584824 its going to be a different feel because were doing five days
5584825 its not going to change its not a family show were still going to be on after 9pm torchwoods a family show if you think its appropriate for your children to watch it we just deal with issues of life but no its not going to be toned down were still going to be edgy because thats what we are
5584826 gt dropped out to be in the doubtless crappy law and order uk but thats just me now what do you think
5584827 with all due respect to cardiff city theres only so many options in a place of that size for stories compared to a huge city like london

5584829 they call him batman because he has big ears and he can fly
5584830 restorationism is based on a belief called the great apostasy that traditional christianity has departed so far from the original christian principles that it is not redeemable
5584831 old philadelphia congregation of the church of christ this congregation came into existence in 1804 the records are in the possession of the church in warren county tennessee
5584832 by cultism we mean the adherence to doctrines which are pointedly contradictory to orthodox christianity and which yet claim the distinction of either tracing their origin to orthodox sources or of being in essential harmony with those sources cultism in short is any major deviation from orthodox christianity relative to the cardinal doctrines of the christian faith
5584833 for by grace you have been saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift if god not of works that no man should glory
5584834 how shall they call on him whom they have not believed and how shall they believe him whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher
5584835 and without faith it is impossible to be well pleasing unto him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that seek after him
5584836 the times of ignorance therefore god overlooked but now he commandeth men that they should all everywhere repent
5584837 behold here is water what doth hinder me to be baptized and philip said if thou believeth with all thy heart thou mayest and he answered and said i believe that jesus christ is the son of god
5584838 and peter said unto them repent ye and be baptized everyone of you in the name of jesus christ unto the remission of your sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy spirit
5584839 ye are an elect race a royal priesthood a holy nation a people for gods own possession that ye may show forth the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light
5584840 but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god
5584841 wherefore my beloved as ye have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling
5584842 restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit
5584843 testifying both to the jews and also to the greeks repentance toward god and faith toward our lord jesus christ
5584844 i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service
5584845 so that ye may know that ye have eternal life
5584846 but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness
5584847 in my fathers house are many mansions if it were not so i would have told you i go to prepare a place for you
5584848 in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not god and that obey not the gospel of our lord jesus christ

5584897 it is appalling to me that people still want to invoke my fathers name five years after his death to ascribe beliefs ideals values and loyalites to him that cannot possibly be determined and to try to further their own agendas by doing so
5584898 i knew my father pretty well at least better than some of those who entitle themselves to his legacy and his supposed ideals and even i would not presume to say publicly what i know he thought or felt this is especially dangerous in the case of political affiliation
5584899 it is unfair and presumptuous to use him to bolster any platform i would ask that my father not be co opted in this election for either side since he is clearly not here to defend or state his own allegiance

5584901 sugar should be good it has been beaten down a lot in the market so the valuations are also not too high globally the demand supply situation is changing pretty dramatically we would see both in india and globally an increase of demand over supply and within india also i think the quotes are getting more and more reasonable vis vis the state advised prices which are very high compared to the s amp p given by the center so there is enough good news on the macro and some of these companies are really diversified into cogen and ethanol etc so the balrampur chini and the shree renuka sugars of the world are excellent picks on one year timeframe
5584902 web developers often frown on the use of technologies like macromedia flash or adobe shockwave to spice up web interfaces since these technologies are not web standards they may not properly work in all browsers even so some developers continue to use these technologies
5584903 i have never been a big advocate of flash or shockwave when building web interfaces one problem with a technology like flash is learning a whole new development environment as well as a language with actionscript one positive aspect of silverlight is its usage of existing microsoft technologies and a tool like visual studio 2005 technologies and tools that i use every day
5584904 for example a flash application may need to communicate with a back end web service to get data but silverlight can include the code to handle server communications and data loading
5584905 silverlight requires a browser plug in just like competing technologies so the paradigm hasnt shifted that much

5584909 windfall tax was more political nobody really gave it a very serious attention at least after the trust vote got over the tax holiday for gas production is an issue but indian tax regime has been fairly homogenous it has not done funny things it has got a history of doing things only at the budget unless some excise duty tampering etc so i do not think that the government will do any knee jerk on the oil and energy sector

5584918 this planning committee has a draft report into planning i want to see that no delays it needs to be front and centre

5584947 a total of 71 people were on the coach including the driver
5584948 unfortunately one man suffered fatal injuries and was confirmed dead at the scene
5584949 the accident occurred in a very difficult area to access with the coach ending up on its side down a steep embankment which hampered rescue attempts
5584950 due to the scale and seriousness of the incident its fortunate there were not more serious or indeed fatal casualties

5585016 this is about a publishers commitment to its author to get one of a very few pro obama books out into the marketplace in the shortest amount of time
5585017 our initial order was based on the book being available to all booksellers simultaneously an even playing field

5585020 there are more than a dozen big maratha organisations at the state and national level representing the cause of the total 40 million marathas in the state for the first time they will unite and work for a common cause

5585022 even in mumbai marathas eke out a miserable existence on pavements and slums doing odd jobs for sheer survival but the maratha leaders are not concerned now we have decided to do something and seek justice for the community

5585026 as a direct implication this move will now allow voice transmission over the internet for a pc to phone in india which will benefit the bpo industry to a large extent
5585027 if isps want to provide telephony they should take a universal access service licence and pay rs 1 650 crore now they have been given the right on a platter and it violates the level playing field norms the government is following the populist bandwagon
5585028 the iits may provide assistance for preparation of works manual and quality control guidelines for nreg it will also provide technical inputs for improvement in nreg works besides helping create a model for work convergence with other government programmes

5585030 the iims may help in development of tools for programme evaluation and monitoring training and capacity building of programme officers and district programme coordinators it may also help in the development of techniques and tools for convergence of agri business and concurrent evaluation studies on nreg scheme
5585031 case studies may be developed through joint collaboration of the institutions and nreg programme implementation agencies that may be used in teaching as well as training institutions
5585032 as the dust settles from the breakdown of the wto negotiations in geneva some parties are recognizing that there was a good package of results left on the table
5585033 it would be a mistake for the world economy and harmful for developing countries not to retrieve it
5585034 given the high food prices around the world and the need for poor people to lower their cost of food it just does not make sense for the doha negotiations to founder upon this barrier
5585035 since the purpose of a safeguard is to help cushion the effect of a significant increase in imports on local producers an acceptable justification for the safeguard could require examination of factors in addition to increased trade flows
5585036 a big problem with safeguards is that once a country triggers them it can take two years or more to challenge the grounds for imposing them
5585037 in the meantime the new barriers block trade so a compromise could create a speedy due process for challenges without appeal
5585038 this protection could be disciplined and limited it may be understandable that tired negotiators couldnt assemble these and perhaps other variables in a way to solve the problem

5585042 we are almost certainly not going to be able to defend absolutely every bit of coast it would simply be an impossible task both in financial terms and engineering terms
5585043 level best to try to defend communities where there are significant numbers of properties under threat and where its possible to find engineering solutions
5585044 we do not believe there is sufficient knowledge with regard to climate change and the predicted sea level rises we want 20 years of maintaining what we have on the coastline of suffolk and east anglia and the whole of the uk until more knowledge has been gained
5585045 we have always said that we need time and to take an attitude of abandonment to the coastline is very negative they do not know the outcome of abandoning part of the coastline because water has a habit of finding its way into all sorts of places once the sea defence has gone
5585046 we are obviously alarmed by these comments it is disappointing as there was some indication that defra and the environment agency were beginning to pursue a different plan and barbara follett east of england minister said plans to abandon flood defences would not go ahead without the support of the community this seems to be a backward step it seems the environment agency is going back to taking a hard line approach
5585047 chris smiths wide ranging speech must be taken seriously the government must listen to the concerns of the people of suffolk and the rest of the east coast we want managed defence not managed retreat this must not be the first government in history to abandon britain to the sea
5585048 lord smith has again drawn attention to the fact that as a nation we have to make hard decisions about how to deal with the problem of coastal erosion and sea level rise
5585049 to the home owner we are sorry about any damage and we are grateful for time we spent here this is a phat house and we will never 4get living here even though it was only for a couple of weeks thank you squat life
5585050 it is wrong that people can trespass on another persons property and the police should be able to enforce the law which is currently defective
5585051 i am very anxious that we can now have some decent neighbours in it is a bit of a worry being a neighbour to an unoccupied house there is always the threat that someone will get in and be a nuisance to neighbours i am very grateful thankful and relieved that this is at an end
5585052 i am so pleased that there is little damage and the rubbish had been bagged up the fear was that there would be some damage
5585053 a place like this standing empty is always going to be a concern and with the market the way it is it is going to be more common place unfortunately
5585054 i am absolutely delighted that essex police has been recognised in this way
5585055 the headlines and extent of knife crime has not surprised me it is the awareness that has changed and people realise it is a problem that needs to be tackled
5585056 the tide is now starting to turn with this problem but i will not stop until that happens
5585057 we believe a mix of education and enforcement is the answer to tackling knife crime and anti social behaviour
5585058 its important to remember that the vast majority of people are law abiding citizens and that knife crime in the county is low
5585059 however we will never become complacent and will continue to work inside schools and within the communities we serve to keep essex safe
5585060 education and prevention are vital measures in reducing the number of people whose lives are affected by knives but local residents should be assured that essex police will use all the technology available to tackle anyone in this county carrying a weapon and they can expect to be dealt with robustly
5585061 essex is one of the safest counties in the country and does not experience the knife crime problems seen in other areas suffolk homes
5585062 they went through a frightening experience but supported the investigation throughout
5585063 this conviction and sentence should be a reminder to those individuals in these types of offences that suffolk is not a soft target

5585070 yes i am in a bad mood no it is nothing to do with you yes i will get over it understand good lets go on with the lesson

5585126 the quality of the field is outstanding its such a tough competition youve really got to do six outstanding dives in a row
5585127 ive been pretty steady but i havent produced anything really magical and you really have to do that to get anywhere really
5585128 but you never whats going to happen from split second to split second and it only takes a small instant for someone to come off the rails or it only takes the same amount of time for someone to drill a huge dive and you can go from out of medal contention to into medal contention its a fairly dynamic environment so all you can do is concentrate on your own dives and just put you head down and try to do six of the best

5585136 he seems to be getting more and more desperate theres only five days apart between the two incidents we are very concerned he will strike again and wed like to apprehend him as soon as we can senior detective brown said
5585137 its very serious and we were quite horrified watching the second surveillance video the way he was holding the gun where his fingers are in the vicinity of the trigger the way hes lashed out with the gun in his right hand with the purpose of striking the guard

5585144 it was recognised that at this moment of crisis the party needed a close association with my mother through the bloodline
5585145 it was not my choice to live outside pakistan when my mother was sent into exile
5585146 we felt that security inside the grounds would negatively impact both the princes experience and that of his fellow students i would often see a man outside the college gates who looked strangely ordinary and who would follow the crown prince when he left the college i imagine it will be the same for young bilawal the college will demand that the security remain largely invisible
5585147 i feel that partly he is already groomed and partly with age and time hell have to finish himself and finish getting acquainted to everybody and grow up
5585148 when motarma bhutto came to pakistan and joined politics she wrote in her book i didnt choose this life it chose me she didnt know any of the local languages she was 22 years old at 23 she went to prison it didnt take long for her to transform it must have been a gigantic task but she managed
5585149 we feel theres an anger in people and if we are going to save pakistan from a break up we have to convert that anger into positive energy and what more positive than democracy convert it into democracy and make them win the battle on the democratic paper rather than on the streets of pakistan get on with it get it over with get a parliament and make a historical comeback of the party that would quash some of the frustration of the people at large in pakistan
5585150 because of the mother the people have high expectations her replacement is a very difficult job
5585151 high profile persons considered to be under threat from terrorist attack
5585152 ive tried to teach him that when you analyse a person you have to look at their body language and other things bilawal knows pakistani society well from his interaction with drivers cooks and officials
5585153 hes as humble and as hurt as anyone else and of course more
5585154 i feel that partly he is already groomed and partly with age and time hell have to finish himself and get acquainted with everybody and grow up
5585155 when motarma benazir bhutto came to pakistan and joined politics she wrote in her book i didnt choose this life it chose me she didnt know any of the local languages she was 22 years old at 23 she went to prison it didnt take long for her to transform it must have been a gigantic task but she managed
5585156 he may be our chairman but he is my son and he is of a tender age
5585157 because of the mother the people have high expectations her replacement is a very difficult job
5585158 ive tried to teach him that when you analyse a person you have to look at their body language and other things bilawal knows pakistani society well from his interaction with drivers cooks and officials
5585159 hes as humble and as hurt as anyone else and of course more
5585160 even in the context of our feudal traditions it looks silly what on earth can a 19 year old kid who cant even be elected to parliament bring to the party apart from the name bhutto
5585161 i remember him as a shy bespectacled teenager often looking after his sisters he was a film buff and i would struggle to choose a film that he had not seen when we all went to the cinema
5585162 bibi benazir was keen on reading and bought books by the boxful but she was broadminded enough to realise that teenage tastes can vary i remember one summer we spent the entire afternoon at a comic book shop near russell square as bilawal with his sisters completed their collection of buffy the vampire slayer and angel comic books
5585163 his image of the past notwithstanding the role and perception about mr zardari has undergone a sea change in recent years
5585164 it is not at all possible to determine as to what caused the injury
5585165 when i am at university my father will take care of the party
5585166 if the government tries to quash us pakistan will be finished you can write this with my blood
5585167 how many bhuttos will you kill we are all ready to die
5585168 i never heard that landcruisers are fitted with bars that can kill you it is so ridiculous
5585169 the thread that was keeping us together was broken the beads are together because of an explosion of grief but now we need a new thread to hold it all together
5585170 we will avenge the murder of bhutto through the democratic process after winning the elections
5585171 my mother always said that democracy is the best revenge
5585172 the partys long and historic struggle for democracy will continue with a new vigour
5585173 we are writing to the un for an international probe into her martyrdom
5585174 the prime minister underlined the need to push ahead with the democratic process and to avoid any significant delays to the electoral timetable
5585175 benazir bhutto sacrificed her life for pakistans survival and democracy
5585176 we will avenge the murder of bhutto through the democratic process after winning the elections
5585177 we want elections on january 8 and we will not let the government run away from the elections
5585178 any attempt to postpone the elections will not be accepted
5585179 the partys long struggle for democracy will continue with renewed vigour
5585180 she knew she could die so she even chose the exact place where she should be buried
5585181 they have changed his name because they know bhuttos name carries a lot of significance in pakistani politics
5585182 pakistani politics have always been about dynasties this is the bhutto dynasty
5585183 when you have a situation where there are so many questions about how this assassination was treated and when the evidence was apparently cleared away within hours the involvement of the international community could be very important
5585184 how long the postponement will be for will be up to the election commission
5585185 i think we are looking at a delay of a few weeks up to three or four months
5585186 we will avenge the murder of bhutto through the democratic process after winning the elections
5585187 god willing when it is the peoples partys reign when the peoples party government is formed then we would have taken revenge for bibis blood and that blood would not have gone waste

5585189 as a result of numerous consumer complaints of dizziness and nausea promofoods requested that eight million cans of tuna be returned for testing last year promofoods concluded that the cans did not after all contain chemicals that posed a health risk this conclusion is based on the fact that the chemists from promofoods tested samples of the recalled cans and found that of the eight chemicals most commonly blamed for causing symptoms of dizziness and nausea five were not found in any of the tested cans the chemists did find that the three remaining suspected chemicals are naturally found in all other kinds of canned foods

5585197 economic growth has been sluggish against the backdrop of high energy and materials prices and weaker growth in exports
5585198 global financial markets remain unstable and there are downside risks to the world economy particularly the us economy
5585199 while growth will likely remain sluggish for the time being it is expected to return gradually onto a moderate growth path as commodity prices level out and overseas economies move out of their deceleration phase
5585200 is expected to be somewhat higher over the coming months but to moderate gradually thereafter thus it is likely that the economy will return onto a sustainable growth path with price stability

5585251 tapi ayah singa yang satu lagi tampak menakutkan buatku geraknya tak beraturan sibuk menerjang kesana kemari punggungnya pun kotor dan bulu yang koyak suaranya parau dan menyakitkan
5585252 aku bingung apakah maksud dari mimpi ini apakah singa singa itu adalah gambaran dari sifat sifat baik dan buruk yang aku punya lalu singa yang mana yang akan memenangkan pertarungan itu karena sepertinya mereka sama sama kuat

5585318 just prior to the attack on moore bertuzzi had been on a shift to kill a penalty had missed the shift change and had remained on the ice for longer than the rest of his line states crawfords third party defence

5585508 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5585509 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca

5585511 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5585512 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5585513 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5585514 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5585515 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5585516 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen

5585520 there will be no service no prayers and no closure for the family she spent a lifetime tearing apart we cannot come together in the end to see to it that her grandchildren and great grandchildren can say their goodbyes so i say here for all of us goodbye mom
5585521 we even requested a copy of the death certificate something we rarely do to make sure that it wasnt a scam
5585522 i wanted to do the right thing the honest thing
5585523 when she died a co worker gave me a copy of an obituary she wrote for her father as a kind of writing guide what struck me was how my mother was none of the things i was reading she was never there for us she was never good and she left no legacy so how could i say any of the usual things about her
5585524 she was a chameleon she could make outsiders see her in any way that she wanted while behind closed doors she would beat at least one of us every day
5585525 she left all of us struggling we just never learned how to cope with life our father meanwhile was a good man my only hope for him was that he would outlive her just long enough to know some happiness only he didnt

5585532 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas

5585589 i remember the birmingham game and what happened to eduardo the lads were winning 2 1 but then in the last minute gael gave away a really stupid penalty
5585590 at the same time he played brilliantly all season he improved immensely and turned into a great defender as a result but he messed up that day
5585591 i dont think something similar would happen to him now because hes a lot more experienced but it was definitely a match we should have won by a long way
5585592 we were leading and we even had another huge chance to score i think it was bendtner and adebayor who were bearing down on goal but adebayor shot instead of passing and missed
5585593 there were an awful lot of other similarly negative things happening everything began with eduardos injury then came gaels error and that thing with william
5585594 you could say that was probably where the ground started to crumble beneath our feet
5585595 it was not an easy situation on the other hand it was williams first season as captain and its not easy to wear the armband in a team like this
5585596 i think he will have learned there were things he could have done better but he knows that better than anyone else
5585597 hes really immersed in everything and that was something he just got immersed in too deeply

5585606 kami tidak menjadikan kehidupan abadi bagi seorang manusiapun sebelum kamu muhammad maka jikalau kamu mati apakah mereka akan kekal
5585607 khidhir jika dia itu seorang manusia maka sungguh ia telah masuk dalam keumuman ayat ini tanpa ada keraguan seorang tidak boleh mengkhususkannya dari keumuman itu kecuali dengan dalil yang shahih
5585608 asalnya memang tidak boleh mengkhususkannya sampai dalil telah nyata sementara tidak disebutkan adanya dalil yang mengkhususkannya dari seorang yang mashum yang wajib diterima
5585609 apakah kamu mengakui dan menerima perjanjian ku terhadap yang demikian itu
5585610 kalau begitu saksikanlah hai para nabi dan aku menjadi saksi pula bersama kamu
5585611 allah tidak mengutus seorang nabi di antara para nabi kecuali dia mengambil perjanjian padanya jika allah mengutus muhammad shallallahu alaihi wasallam sedang nabi itu hidup maka ia nabi itu betul betul harus beriman kepada beliau dan menolongnya
5585612 andaikan musa hidup tentunya tidak mungkin baginya kecuali harus mengikutiku
5585613 tidak ada satu jiwa pun yang hidup pada hari ini telah lewat 100 tahun sedang ia hidup pada hari itu
5585614 rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wasallam hanya memaksudkan bahwa dalam jangka waktu ini suatu generasi telah punah
5585615 sesungguhnya hadits ini termasuk dalil yang memutuskan tentang kematian nabi khidir sekarang
5585616 ya allah jika pasukan ini hancur maka engkau tidak akan disembah lagi dimuka bumi
5585617 andaikan khidir masih hidup maka wajib baginya untuk datang kepada nabi shallallahu alaihi wasallam dan berjihad di hadapannya serta belajar dari beliau nabi shallallahu alaihi wasallam
5585618 ya allah jika pasukan ini hancur maka engkau tidak akan disembah lagi dimuka bumi
5585619 tidak ada yang menyebarkan berita berita seperti ini yakni tentang hidupnya khidir di antara manusia kecuali setan
5585620 aku telah mengadakan riset tentang hidupnya khidir apakah ia masih ada ataukah tidak maka tiba tiba kebanyakan orang orang bodoh tertipu bahwa ia masih hidup karena hadits hadits lemah yang dirwayatkan dalam hal tersebut
5585621 hadits hadits yang disebutkan di dalamnya tentang khidir dan hidupnya semuanya adalah dusta palsu tidak shahih satu hadits pun tentang hidupnya nabi khidir
5585622 riwayat riwayat dan hikayat hikayat ini merupakan sandaran orang yang berpendapat tentang hidupnya nabi khidir sampai hari ini semua hadits hadits yang marfu ini adalah dhaif jiddan lemah sekali tidak bisa dijadikan hujjah dalam urusan agama
5585623 tidak terbukti tentang pertemuan nabi khidir bersama dengan seorang nabi kecuali bersama musa sebagaimana allah taala telah kisahkan tentang berita keduanya semua berita tentang hidupnya tak ada yang shahih sedikitpun berdasarkan kesepakatan para penukil hadits ahli hadits hal itu hanyalah disebutkan oleh orang yang meriwayatkan berita tersebut dan tidak menyebutkan penyakitnya entah karena ia tidak mengetahuinya atau karena jelasnya penyakit berita tersebut di sisi para ahli hadits

5585633 squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent senator obama
5585634 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5585635 john mccain is intent on spending 10bn a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5585636 he phoned the priest and said there were suspicious people outside the house just after the phone call the robbers apparently attacked them in the house
5585637 the priest called the police and said the missionaries were possibly in danger and the wierdaburg police reacted immediately
5585638 police fired at the robbers and caught two of them on the small holding
5585639 the others fled but the police expect to catch them soon
5585640 they are one of the biggest packs in the world and that in itself is a challenge
5585641 its going to be a big battle for us theres cj van der linde and i think the beast tendai mtawarira will be playing so thats going to be a big battle for us and how we can step up and improve
5585642 being consistent in our set pieces and making sure we get that right but also just bringing the aggression up right from the start
5585643 they are passionate at home and theyve got passionate supporters so if we get on top of them early then that will set us up for a good game
5585644 my first test was at ellis park in johannesburg in 2006 it was a huge shock it was a bit of a wake up call for me
5585645 i was playing club rugby about three weeks beforehand and then i was in front of 70 000 screaming south africans at altitude
5585646 for a front rower your scrummaging is your no 1 focus so ive been working really hard on that with wallabies set piece coach michael foley
5585647 thats been my goal just keep my scrummaging going and if anything else comes for me its an added bonus
5585648 technically the all blacks are probably the best scrummaging team in the world at the moment but the springboks are right up there
5585649 when we look back at the weekend we should not forget that in addition to significant damage to private property key parts of our roads infrastructure the new broadway underpass and roads around the international airport were closed

5585651 if as seems to be the case outbursts of torrential rain are to become a characteristic of northern irelands climate government departments and agencies should have plans in place to minimise both the chances of flooding and the disruption which follows floods
5585652 the time is right for this the people of northern ireland want it eight out of 10 people in the recent life and times survey highlighted that they would like to live in mixed areas
5585653 but it is also the start of another one because theres no way of predicting what will happen to me afterwards
5585654 im hoping it will be sufficient for me to think about working again which at the moment is impossible

5585659 huge contribution to bbc wales over many years in a wide range of programming
5585660 first as a current affairs journalist but above all as someone who got to the heart of the sporting world that is so important to wales
5585661 he combined great knowledge and enthusiasm with humour and wit
5585662 bob had an unmistakable and distinctive style that brought him a huge following throughout wales
5585663 as the face of bbc wales sports coverage for many years bobs passion love and understanding of sport created beautiful writing and first class journalism
5585664 along with his wider contribution to news and current affairs at the bbc his commitment to journalism in wales was second to none
5585665 he is leaving behind a very complex and troubling legacy for pakistan
5585666 distortion of the constitution manufactured political groups that supported him insurgency in afghanistan talibanisation in the northwestern frontier region and a structurally weak economy all count against him

5585671 the main thing for england is you need players who can play under pressure and do it under the spotlight because you know there is a lot of criticism waiting from the public
5585672 youve got to deal with that that is the hardest obstacle we are going to get over as a team playing under that intense pressure
5585673 some players can do it better than others that is just how it is we need england to get over that psychological barrier
5585674 its a process we might not go out there on wednesday and win 6 0 and have everyone saying we can be world champions we have to be realistic and build on our confidence
5585675 playing for chelsea and playing for england are two completely different things international football is different
5585676 i wouldnt say any one player lacks confidence we need to improve our mentality as a team we are doing that were not burying our heads in the sand we are trying to play and get the ball down we need to stay cool and calm
5585677 its pigeon steps the world cup isnt for two years we need to improve slowly so when we get there we are better physically mentally and technically
5585678 as a group its something we need to improve on we are doing things to improve we need to go out there and be free results help that theres no science to it you need the results to breed confidence

5585693 nos remarcaba que as ayud bamos en la presi n conjunta del equipo
5585694 de jugar pendiente de los pases largos que van por detr s de la zaga
5585695 implica tener mucha concentraci n pero m s que tener buenos pies hay que estar perfectamente colocado en armon a con los movimientos de los centrales
5585696 tambi n es un ejercicio de confianza hacia los porteros porque dejamos muchos metros a nuestras espaldas
5585697 y todos los del bar a se desenvuelven de maravilla en estos espacios
5585698 ni fallar en el corte porque dejamos la porter a vac a
5585699 la primera en una pierna un problema de isquiotibiales que ya ha superado y la otra en el pie derecho su pie de apoyo una inflamaci n muy dolorosa en la inserci n sea del tend n muy cerca del tobillo
5585700 los j venes han visto posturas en veteranos que espero que no tengan que ver m s
5585701 yo he fallado y hay cosas que no repetir nunca m s pero no las dir
5585702 nosotros estamos mejor que hace tres d as y no s si los croatas pueden haber acusado cierto triunfalismo
5585703 estamos mejor que hace tres d as no s si ellos han acusado triunfalismo
5585704 psicol gicamente es mejor llegar desde una derrota sabes que te pueden ganar
5585705 es mejor para el aspecto psicol gico llegar desde una derrota porque as se es consciente de que cualquiera te puede ganar
5585706 si estamos al ciento por ciento tenemos muchas posibilidades pero es importante que volvamos a sonre r en la pista
5585707 fue el momento en que sent el peligro m s cerca
5585708 sab amos el riesgo que corr amos y decidimos correrlo
5585709 nadie se puede arrepentir de ser el presidente del celta yo tampoco
5585710 ya no es factible que el club se vea abocado a la liquidaci n
5585711 quien quiera ganarle al celta va a tener que correr mucho
5585712 pero si ayer ya hice nota de prensa ya habl no le entiendo
5585713 tenemos que aprovechar la velocidad que hay arriba a ag ero messi y riquelme que a veces hace pases que s lo ve l
5585714 brasil siempre se caracteriz por un juego lento de manejar la pelota y tocarla bien hay que respetarlos tienen mucha calidad y te pueden ganar en cualquier momento
5585715 being consistent in our set pieces and making sure we get that right but also just bringing the aggression up right from the start
5585716 they are passionate at home and theyve got passionate supporters so if we get on top of them early then that will set us up for a good game
5585717 they are one of the biggest packs in the world and that in itself is a challenge its going to be a big battle for us theres cj van der linde and i think the beast will be playing so thats going to be a big battle for us and how we can step up and improve
5585718 technically the all blacks are probably the best scrummaging team in the world at the moment but the springboks are right up there they are a dominant side and a powerful bunch of blokes and they can cause trouble
5585719 no estar a mal que este triunfo sirviera para que en adelante se preste un poco m s de atenci n al ciclismo femenino que est un poco hu rfano desde que se fue joane somarriba la pista no tira mucho a los j venes y sin embargo es una especialidad muy divertida
5585720 muchas son de carretera que ocasionalmente practican tambi n la pista
5585721 vi a leire en unos campeonatos de espa a en 2004 y le coment que no se preocupase porque la integrar a en el equipo nacional
5585722 es la nica forma de progresar competir fuera de espa a en la copa del mundo en este ltimo a o lo hemos hecho de manera m s intensa porque la clasificaci n para los juegos as lo exig a
5585723 en todas las pruebas en las que hemos participado hemos conseguido medalla o estado entre los ocho primeros clasificados
5585724 el ciclismo espa ol en general tiene buena salud a pesar de que sufra alg n tropez n de vez en cuando
5585725 en espa a la pista no brilla como en otros pa ses pero se est trabajando para poder estar en estas competiciones internacionales
5585726 al principio me asustaba luchar con 20 rivales a 60 kil metros por hora
5585727 estoy enganchada compitiendo es cuando m s viva me siento
5585728 lo ten a cerca de casa hab a ido alguna vez a ver los seis d as pero el ciclismo no me atra a en especial
5585729 era incre ble se hab a montado por primera vez en la bici y se met a en los sprints como si nada la sometimos a unos controles f sicamente estaba fenomenal ha seguido las pautas y en carrera es muy inteligente
5585730 ha salido como hab amos planeado se me ha hecho muy largo no sab a cu ntas fuerzas me quedaban pero me quedaban
5585731 primero ha acumulado unos puntos despu s ha regulado si entraba en los dos ltimos sprints no iba a sacar nada val a la pena recuperar en el pen ltimo esperar atr s y dar el m ximo en el ltimo a veces se obceca y se le atraganta la carrera pero ha sabido relajarse
5585732 ha sido uno de los d as en que he salido m s tranquila
5585733 pero disfruta entren ndose y ha progresado a pasos agigantados
5585734 pod a hacer algo subir un pelda o ganar esta medalla es una ilusi n tremenda crec como atleta viendo los juegos en el sal n de mi casa los problemas me quitaron un poco esa ilusi n y decid dejar el atletismo se lo debo todo a javier
5585735 al principio me asustaba mucho luchar con 20 rivales codo con codo y a 60 kil metros por hora pero me ha enganchado esa sensaci n de velocidad compitiendo es cuando m s viva me siento
5585736 ha trabajado mucho con l le faltaba dominar la carrera rodar y colocarse bien en el grupo no entrar en todos los
5585737 ya te lo dije el d a 18 ten amos que pedalear los dos
5585738 no me gusta hablar me gusta hacer he vuelto a demostrar quien soy
5585739 por eso espero mantener esta posici n el m ximo tiempo posible intento demostrar que nadie me puede ganar mis rivales me empujan y me encolerizan como jennifer pero ya hemos visto lo que ha pasado a m no me gusta hablar me gusta hacer he vuelto a demostrar quien soy
5585740 stuczynski ha puesto la barra un cent metro por encima de su r cord del mundo pero ha fallado
5585741 y no miro a lo que hace isinbayeva acab como una campeona pero me lleva una d cada de ventaja necesito m s experiencia cuesti n de tiempo
5585742 con una t cnica excelente lanzar a sobre 71 metros seguro
5585743 ah puede ser usted figura y optar a becas y victorias
5585744 un d a me pregunt vale la pena el sacrificio
5585745 en nataci n entraba en las finales de los campeonatos de espa a en espalda y era decimoctavo es un deporte duro y sacrificado del que se recuerda a phelps a popov pero no al segundo
5585746 en waterpolo por contra los entrenamientos no son tan duros no tienes que levantarte a las seis de la ma ana la pelotita es m s divertida es como elegir entre jugar al f tbol o dar diez vueltas a la pista de atletismo
5585747 era titular de la selecci n ten a 18 a os y me encantaba el baloncesto ten a becas de universidades como la de stamford me ofrec an unos contratos incre bles pero entonces s lo pensaba en que me gustaba correr y saltar y en que acababa de cumplir el objetivo de mi vida estar en los juegos de barcelona
5585748 ese a o hab a empezado derecho y valor que la vida de atleta es un poco m s sedentaria no como la del baloncesto que jugaba todos los fines de semana
5585749 mi h ndicap es haber aprendido la base t cnica del salto con 20 a os pero no me equivoqu con el cambio hay que luchar ahora por la ma ana soy atleta desde las cuatro de la tarde abogada
5585750 que nunca ser n de primera l nea porque les faltan dos segundos
5585751 si les cogemos con 17 o 18 a os y con buenas condiciones f sicas no es tarde para aprender las t cnicas
5585752 he tenido corredores que hac an baloncesto voleibol f tbol o balonmano porque son grandes potentes y fuertes
5585753 tenemos el ejemplo de hodei mazquiaran jugaba al baloncesto y coordinaba infinidad de movimientos hoy es subcampe n europeo
5585754 entre el patinaje sobre ruedas y sobre hielo por ejemplo hay transferencias
5585755 pero a niveles normales es inviable una persona que aer bicamente tenga un buen rendimiento no puede correr los 10 000 metros
5585756 venga m ster que s lo queremos darle la bienvenida usted tambi n tiene que firmar
5585757 vicente es as le conozco de antes lo que tiene es la ilusi n de hacer las cosas bien
5585758 tiene ganas de trabajar y de seguir con el proyecto que hab a antes
5585759 tengo la obligaci n de mantener y potenciar lo conseguido el esp ritu la cohesi n de grupo y la humildad
5585760 se ha retirado para no perder y salvar as la cara
5585761 liu estaba sometido a una gran presi n e insisti en correr a pesar de sus problemas f sicos
5585762 hasta el s bado pasado liu xiang estaba en muy buena forma
5585763 no nos dimos cuenta de que era algo tan serio nadie sab a en ese momento que no podr a competir
5585764 liu xiang ten a miedo de no vencer al cubano dayron robles pero si hubiera sido lo suficientemente valiente se habr a enfrentado a l y si no hubiera ganado lo habr amos comprendido
5585765 con esta forma de abandonar ha herido a muchos chinos que confiaban en l
5585766 se ha retirado para no perder durante la carrera y salvar as la cara de china
5585767 esto dar mucho que pensar a m s de uno

5585769 we are delighted that we are involved with utimaco as a reseller but we are limited in what we can say because it is a pre offer
5585770 we cant make any comment at this stage other than what we have gone public with we cant make any predictions about the future because that could affect the share pricing and utimaco is a publically listed company on the german stock exchange
5585771 information security should be as commonplace as anti virus protection no longer a nice to have but a must have companies of all sizes are looking to protect against both external and internal threats with one manageable solution

5585781 id never done anything like it before and it was pretty daunting
5585782 all we expected to do on our first visit was to explore the possibilities but we achieved much more than that and the whole thing went fantastically well
5585783 the way pont works is to create sustainable improvements and not to try to introduce a quick fix and that is why we want to ensure that there are enough trainers in place
5585784 we really didnt expect to make such progress and it was very satisfying to be able to get so much done

5585795 now those men and those women who know no more about the powers of god and the influences of the holy spirit than to be led entirely by another person suspending their own understanding and pinning their faith upon anothers sleeve will never be capable of entering into the celestial glory to be crowned as they anticipate they never will be capable of becoming gods

5585842 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5585843 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5585844 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5585845 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5585846 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5585847 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5585848 we deeply regret that we caused the patient irreparable harm we will take measures so that this will never happen again
5585849 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5585850 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5585851 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5585852 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5585853 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5585854 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5585855 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5585856 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5585857 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5585858 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5585859 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5585860 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5585861 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5585862 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5585863 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5585864 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5585865 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5585866 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5585867 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5585868 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5585869 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba

5585873 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5585874 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5585875 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5585876 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5585877 we let it be known with the dodgers that was the one ballclub he had interest in going to that any deal we were going to do was going to be the best baseball deal we could do and it wasnt going to be a financial deal to try to move dollars we just werent happy with the prospect we would be getting back and we chose to hold onto him

5585881 we think that operation sentinel and a lot of the surveillance initiatives that the police are planning are an attack on our right to privacy here in new york
5585882 time to maintain this information to enable us to check and see if any information has surfaced concerning a vehicle coming into the city
5585883 but i would submit this will be a much more advanced system than they have in place
5585884 we could get frustrated but the wheels come off when you start to argue
5585885 theres no point you stop and figure it out you talk about it instead of turning your back on your teammate
5585886 we came out flat against belgium and we learned a lot from that
5585887 its important to have a fast start and we did that we played the best team weve played so far and we played steady
5585888 debido a que la cifra solicitada por cemex es muy alta muy por encima de los 1 300 millones de d lares
5585889 cemex tiene problemas ambientales de atraso de tecnolog a lo que significa que no puede ser un valor muy por encima de lo que estamos adquiriendo
5585890 the lack of economic growth in the west will impact demand
5585891 the hurricane season is still a major issue as seen in 2005 with katrina we have to be mindful of that
5585892 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5585893 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5585894 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5585895 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5585896 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5585897 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5585898 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5585899 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5585900 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5585901 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5585902 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5585903 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5585904 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
5585905 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5585906 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5585907 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5585908 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5585909 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5585910 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5585911 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5585912 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5585913 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5585914 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5585915 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5585916 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5585917 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5585918 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5585919 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5585920 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5585921 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers
5585922 if the fact that they were showing up on problem lists for a year doesnt make them high risk i dont know what does
5585923 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
5585924 it was very painful the fact that you have someone telling you they will not help you because of who you are that they will deny your right to be a mother and have a family
5585925 it was clear and emphatic that discrimination has no place in doctors offices
5585926 the supreme courts desire to promote the homosexual lifestyle at the risk of infringing upon the first amendment right to free exercise of religion is what the public needs to learn about
5585927 we see this move as an indication of preparedness of belarus government to restore constructive dialogue with the international community and to get actively involved in the all european processes
5585928 negligent in the speed with which they pronounced my daughters death
5585929 in medicine when we see something like this we call it a medical miracle but at this point we do not have an explanation
5585930 the only reason that i and other municipal standards officers have not charged titan as well is simply because we have not been successful in determining titans correct legal name from corporate and business names searches conducted

5585935 in recent weeks we have made our best efforts to find an amicable solution that could lead to a successful merger despite the willingness from tgs to increase the exchange ratio and change both the constitution of the board and the management reporting structure wavefield management was unable to demonstrate to our satisfaction an enthusiastic commitment to a true integration of the two companies
5585936 we expect the next two to three years to present the most favourable market conditions we have ever experienced for our products and services we need to be fully occupied on converting these opportunities into profit rather than dealing with the serious internal strife caused by a contentious integration process

5585942 the acquisition of new ground helps us to build our exploration portfolio within the wave project area in which we are expecting to delineate a resource of 1 million ounces of gold in the coming years
5585943 following our recent dealings on the tavsan project our licence portfolio in western turkey is now even more focused on the wave project area which enables an ease of logistics and better use of our human and financial resources the company holds some of the best exploration properties in western turkey and we look forward to developing our licence portfolio and target stream yet further

5585985 you look like some fat bloke who swallowed matthew pinsent
5585986 if i was doing this just for myself i might have chosen a different course but i put pakistan first as always
5585987 i have to admit i never thought david james would win his place back in the team
5585988 but fair play to him when robinsons level dipped he was in the form of his life and he has taken his chance with both hands since you cannot argue with that
5585989 he is the man in the driving seat he owns that number one jersey and he wont just give it away
5585990 he is on a massive high after a brilliant season that culminated in portsmouth winning the fa cup a remarkable achievement
5585991 i think david gets better with age and he is showing great maturity too he probably enjoys the fact that there is less pressure playing at pompey than any of the big four
5585992 people talk about his age but he is definitely capable of staying at the same level for two more years until the world cup
5585993 i played in a world cup in 1990 when i was nearly 41 and i thought i had a very good tournament so it can certainly be done
5585994 if david maintains his form and doesnt get injured which are two fairly big ifs i would expect him to be there in 2010
5585995 paul was unfortunate he just made too many mistakes too close together and he had to pay the price
5585996 i want an england keeper to make no more than one mistake per season but he made probably three in quick succession and he ended up losing his place
5585997 all the best goalkeepers make errors and paul is no exception but the very best ones make fewer
5585998 i sincerely hope that we see a big improvement in paul robinson in a blackburn shirt this season because at his best he is a very fine keeper
5585999 i know he has got it in him to rediscover what made him the england number one in the first place
5586000 it wont be an easy task seeing that in the first four premier league squads there are four foreign starting keepers and frequently so are the back ups
5586001 there are more good keepers around now than there were a few years ago thats for sure
5586002 in robinson scott carson chris kirkland ben foster joe hart and robert green there are enough people for you to expect someone is going to mount a serious challenge
5586003 it is up to each and every one of them to put pressure on david and fight for the jersey i wouldnt commit to any single one of them right now but it is definitely up for grabs
5586004 it would be a great thing for english football if someone could step up and really stake a claim

5586043 tentu saja seperti yang telah kukatakan sebelumnya kita melihat setiap hari di koran dan tv banyak perkara kriminal dan kekerasan di antara manusia perkara perkara tersebut adalah manifestasi dari kejahatan
5586044 sekali lagi anda salah pak kajahatan itu tidak ada kejahatan adalah ketiadaan tuhan seperti dingin atau gelap kajahatan adalah kata yang dipakai manusia untuk mendeskripsikan ketiadaan tuhan tuhan tidak menciptakan kajahatan kajahatan adalah hasil dari tidak adanya kasih tuhan dihati manusia seperti dingin yang timbul dari ketiadaan panas dan gelap yang timbul dari ketiadaan cahaya

5586050 i think ive gotten a lot better ive spent some time trying to work on what the coaches have been telling me about like blitzes its only been a couple of months so i have a lot to work on
5586051 were going to work them all we are going to see how it pans out among all of them
5586052 we may end up playing with two or three of those guys by committee so to speak if ahmans not ready to go

5586055 hes been my locker mate all these years its rough to see it end like this were going to do something special this year and id love for him to be a part of it
5586056 but hell be fine he loves to play this game so theres no way youre going to keep him out of this game
5586057 this is not how i want to end this game i want to walk off the field this is not it for me hopefully i can get back completely healthy and keep going with what ive started
5586058 i expect fred to play in this league for a long time
5586059 but in fairness to him hes got to get healthy to play the way hes capable of playing and i sure hope its for us but fred will play in the nfl for somebody no doubt in my mind

5586093 yesterday was super fun we surfed this semi secret spot which was like a 10 minuite drive down some junglely aussie bush trail and joel was bustin some sweet corners off road in the
5586094 after surfing this morning we headed to currumbin wildlife park to get a sneak peak at some of australias amazing animals when we arrived we headed straight to the reptile zone to have a look at some deadly snakes and two headed lizzards zack went up and held a snake while the rest of us kept well away next up was the free flying bird show we saw loads of different species of birds but the stand out of the show was the wedge tailed eagle that thing was huge and it skimmed all of our heads while flying into the arena the kangaroos were the best there were loads of cute little joeys and some massive kangas everyone was a lot more comfortable getting up close with the kangaroos than the snakes and we all got to stroke and feed them anyways the wildlife park has definately been one of the highlights of the trip for everyone and a good way to end the trip
5586095 had amazing waves since weve been here although there is a major lack of left handers in oz

5586098 desde octubre de 2007 hemos instado al gobierno a tomar acciones efectivas pero no se han concretado avances importantes esperamos que en un futuro cercano observemos un cambio en la voluntad pol tica de las autoridades argentinas y especialmente de la presidenta cristina fern ndez de kirchner como cabeza de gobierno en materia de violencia de g nero ya que esto significar a para muchas mujeres la posibilidad de una mejor vida y para otras la vida

5586124 i think one difficulty is that the problem is one of such enormous complexity that the very mass of facts presented to the public by press and radio make it exceedingly difficult for the man in the street to reach a clear appraisement of the situation it is virtually impossible at this distance to grasp at all the real significance of the situation

5586194 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
5586195 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
5586196 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
5586197 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
5586198 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5586199 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5586200 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5586201 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5586202 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5586203 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5586204 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5586205 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5586206 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
5586207 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
5586208 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
5586209 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
5586210 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
5586211 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
5586212 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5586213 this is a planning took where all things are going
5586214 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
5586215 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
5586216 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
5586217 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
5586218 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
5586219 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5586220 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5586221 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5586222 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5586223 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5586224 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5586225 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5586226 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5586227 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5586228 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5586229 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5586230 their model is in line with companies like us we want to keep things as simple as possible and keep costs as low as possible
5586231 theyre in the phase where theyre getting big customers if they do well with the rollouts theyll get the attention of a lot of mainstream corporations
5586232 workday is like the ipod for enterprise hr software its a better and simpler way of doing things and people can see it
5586233 twenty customers does not a success make you have to be ready to put 10 years into this deal
5586234 the idea that apple can choose what functionality my applications should have frightens me
5586235 how about legislation that requires a mandatory kill switch be integrated into every human being so that the police can kill an individual without even needing to dispatch an officer to a scene
5586236 this helps us to determine how best to provide useful information to customers and to understand which parts of our websites products and internet services are of most interest to them
5586237 thats the holy grail by continually monitoring how consumers are using the phone they are able to be super responsive to glitches
5586238 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5586239 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5586240 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5586241 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5586242 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5586243 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5586244 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5586245 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5586246 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5586247 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5586248 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5586249 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5586250 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5586251 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5586252 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5586253 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5586254 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5586255 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5586256 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5586257 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5586258 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5586259 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5586260 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5586261 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5586262 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5586263 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5586264 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5586265 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5586266 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5586267 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5586268 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5586269 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5586270 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5586271 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5586272 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5586273 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5586274 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5586275 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5586276 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5586277 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5586278 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5586279 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5586280 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5586281 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5586282 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5586283 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5586284 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5586285 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5586286 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5586287 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5586288 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5586289 pensamos que el tributo debe hacerce en el marco de los porque ellos eran parte de la familia ol mpica no eran personas comunes que estaban de visita
5586290 i always thought the knuckleball was the easiest pitch to catch wait till it stops rolling then go to the backstop and pick it up
5586291 we are strongly of the view that ret is very likely to result in abatement that is at higher costs than would otherwise be necessary to meet our emissions reductions targets the groups chief executive heather ridout said
5586292 i want to make very clear that the renewable energy target was a very clear election commitment to the australian people by the rudd labor government and its a commitment we will be meeting senator wong said in sydney
5586293 we believe it is important for the government to provide incentives to the market to invest in renewable energy so that future generations of australians have a range of clean energy options available to them she said
5586294 we remain committed to ensuring that 20 per cent of australias energy comes from renewable sources by 2020
5586295 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5586296 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5586297 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5586298 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5586299 major league gaming has established themselves in the states and they have stops throughout the year
5586300 guys in the states can make a quarter million dollars just to play and then additional endorsement deals and the winnings
5586301 were not looking for someone who is only good at halo 3 because the games do change so we want someone who is an all around gamer so that when the games do change he can make that transition
5586302 were looking at 8 hours a day not necessarily all playing but maybe 50 playing and 50 studying the game
5586303 for example after every halo 3 match you can watch the whole game like a replay
5586304 so we go through the game film we can see the other teams strategy and we can work on certain mistakes that weve made so theres a lot of studying involved not just playing
5586305 many people benefit from the ability of uv to help generate
5586306 this world demands the qualities of youth not a time of life but a state of mind a temper of the will a quality of imagination a predominance of courage over timidity of the appetite for adventure over the love of ease
5586307 if you can dodge a wrench you can dodge a ball

5586312 the scholarship is our way of thanking military families for the sacrifices they make each and every day
5586313 weve helped over 10 000 service members enroll in career training over the years and its gratifying to now be helping military spouses
5586314 there is increasing awareness that military families especially the children can be significantly affected when a parent is deployed and there is even greater psychological wear and tear when there are multiple deployments
5586315 the spouse left behind is suddenly thrust into the role of being a single parent routines are interrupted the children may not understand where their mom or dad has gone and the service member on the front lines is constantly worried about how their family is doing back home
5586316 its a three pronged approach to restore a psychological balance to the family promote future resiliency and increase knowledge and understanding among the military family culture
5586317 if there are five family members theres a good chance that there are five different stories of what that most recent deployment experience was like
5586318 family members often dont want to burden each other with their personal problems but in these exceptional circumstances of long term separations building a shared family narrative can be very helpful in reestablishing a close family identity and building its strength

5586358 its very difficult to deal with the radicals on an intellectual basis to open up their minds
5586359 so having these muslim scholars from all different parts of the world pushing for a more tolerant course i think will help the government in dealing with radical groups internally
5586360 at this moment were not going to indulge in any political issues
5586361 there are so many other things on which we can find common ground
5586362 its good to bring people in to saudi arabia however we want more muslim scholars and leaders to go and interact with western intellectuals and spain is a good choice to start with as it represents a place of interfaith tolerance historically
5586363 the fact that the king is going is a powerful statement that hes investing in this personally and wants it to succeed

5586367 to face the challenges of isolation ignorance and narrow horizons so that the world can absorb the good message of islam
5586368 thisstarted out as an academic process but our aim was to simply take theway scriptural reasoning was done and to allow young people who arefaithful to their religions to come together and gain understanding
5586369 weasked them to choose the themes and to present an interesting text fromtheir faith tradition that will foster discussion on that theme
5586370 t hen we study these textswithin themselves without comparing them

5586395 there are bad storms and there are nice ones and this is a nice one
5586396 it cleans out all the trees it gives people a little work to do and it gets the tourists out of here for a few days
5586397 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5586398 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5586399 ive got a generator and ive got a concrete home that i built myself so i know it can withstand this
5586400 every hurricane that we have we have additional lessons learned and experience
5586401 this is a broad really diffuse storm all the florida keys and all the florida peninsula are going to feel the effects of this storm no matter where the center makes landfall

5586407 the cover was 20 and the warm up dj was received better than madden
5586408 clearly these are the most popular people to step foot in the white house in some time
5586409 the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno
5586410 that was a really poor foolish decision on the part of our key guys
5586411 a couple guys chose to make a decision there that really impacts all of us
5586412 i know they were probably frustrated from the standpoint that wanting to show that hey we have less horsepower than ever before and they wanted to make it look like were handicapped even more than we actually were
5586413 the engine shop thats kind of a badge of honor you win that engine dyno good for you thats kind of how we felt in the past few years and mark cronquist and those guys really feel like they want to win that thing
5586414 the way i look at it to come back after youve been chopped to come back and win it again thats awesome
5586415 thats a great story that wasnt able to be told
5586416 i anticipate that we havent seen the end of it yet
5586417 well figure out exactly what happened and those that were responsible
5586418 theres going to be punishment for that thats just part of life you cant do that
5586419 if this alleged incident proves true it goes against everything we stand for as an organization
5586420 we will take full responsibility and accept any penalties nascar levies against us
5586421 i was surprised to see what was happening and astonished and frankly incredulous
5586422 i couldnt believe it was happening because its clearly defined in the entry forms that you dont do this sort of thing but im sure joe and j d will take care of that internally and whatever fans think theyre going to think were just going to keep working on our stuff
5586423 its not something that you like to hear about and you have to just question every chassis dyno thats ever been run on every toyota
5586424 i dont know is if its a toyota problem if its a joe gibbs thing how widespread is it and how long has it been going on
5586425 its disappointing to hear that anybody whether its a manufacturer or a team or an individual on a team would go to any length to do that its bad for the entire garage i think
5586426 if theyre going to make decisions based on parity after theyve given toyota what theyve given them with regard to parameters on their engine based on flawed data that a team or the manufacturer one of the other had kited or shaved that certainly is detrimental to my interests
5586427 to go through what i went through and be back on top again im just so blessed right now
5586428 they had guys in 68 that didnt make the team that could whip this team im not taking anything away from these young athletes but i dont think they have anywhere near the depth we had
5586429 i came to the birds nest to lay a golden egg and thats what i did
5586430 i am surprised we havent won more gold but you know what i hope this sets a trend

5586443 we are coming here to submit a letter to the british government asking them to return thaksin to receive justice in
5586444 thaksin is not a political refugee but a criminal evading an arrest warrant
5586445 they schedule strikes shouldnt it be rather spontaneous to really mess up the works
5586446 the best blogs have a tinge of obsession about them
5586447 a big hit on the web one of londons obsessives
5586448 im very confident that there are losses from doing this to the whole economy
5586449 theyre small losses but it just amazes me that we are sleep walking our way into a mistake
5586450 this is doing something that will do quite a lot of harm to the industry

5586453 there is no doubt that revenue from us visitors over the past year will have been lower than would have been the case if sterling had remained at the 1 80 mark
5586454 but we will need sterling to remain at its new cheaper level for some months before we start to recoup these losses

5586457 i used to use an awful lot of sunbeds id go about three times a week
5586458 it was very much a part of the culture in liverpool where i was a student
5586459 having seen these images i am totally and utterly disgusted i can honestly say i am never going to use a sunbed again
5586460 there are so many warnings about things that give you cancer these days that if theres anything you can do to definitely diminish the risk of cancer it is a good thing
5586461 i hope the horrible image of me will make other young people think twice before they next use a sunbed
5586462 too many people want to look like celebrities who are perfectly tanned but their skin is good because they spend thousands on holidays and treatments not a pound a time in the salons
5586463 we want to provide young people with a shocking visual representation of how sunbeds and over exposure to the sun can dramatically affect the way you look further down the line
5586464 while young people may be using sunbeds as they think they make them look good now in the long term they are doing serious damage to their looks

5586466 i would choose john terry 100 i always have and i always will i went on record before the last world cup that i thought he should have got it then
5586467 he would have been my captain then and nothing has changed since for me he is a great leader a great man and a great footballer
5586468 i have nothing against stevie gerrard who i had the pleasure of playing with on his debut or rio they are both great players but john terry can organise it and lead better than anyone else why has he not already chosen him
5586469 some people who spend a lot of time thinking about popular music try awfully hard not to associate themselves with other people who spend a lot of time thinking about popular music

5586481 we put a lot of time and effort into building dick to support the local charity it took three hours to build him and he has proved popular with everyone especially our young nephews
5586482 he had been up in the garden by the roadside for a couple of weeks but when we woke up on sunday morning he was gone
5586483 taking him would be no easy task as he was quite a weight there must have been more than one person involved
5586484 this may have been some prank by someone walking home drunk but it is a big blow to us and neighbour paul manners who also helped us let everyone know about dick
5586485 we have got involved in this to support tyddyn m n and mencap it is probably someone who does not get involved in these things that has done this thinking it is a great joke
5586486 they said they would investigate and would carry out house to house enquiries so we hope someone is caught as we would like dick back
5586487 a similar thing happened five years ago when the charity itself had a scarecrow stolen on this road
5586488 the judging of the scarecrows was due to take place on sunday so we didnt even have time to build another and we have missed out i think we would have had a good chance because we put a lot of effort in
5586489 its not going to happen if youre coming for that youll be disappointed
5586490 my heart is afraid it will have to suffer terribly
5586491 tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself

5586499 it must be the gods who are angry at our village
5586500 it is a harmful spirit which has caused our children to become lost and confused
5586501 you should not jump to such conclusions until you have heard the reason why you have had no lunch today
5586502 a long time ago when i was young my grandmother and my grandfather told me that a day would come when the water would no longer come to us in our village
5586503 now is the time to gather our most beautiful daughters and our strongest young men and go together to the mountain with no name we must find a name for our mountain and it will once again give to us the water that we want and need
5586504 yes it is true though i was very young i remember the exact day in the spring when this story was told it was soon after hat we asked the elders to grant their blessings for our wedding
5586505 it must be that as the young men go into the mountain to search for its name our beautiful daughters must remain at the spot had flowed and sing the most beautiful songs to the mountain
5586506 the grandfather and grandmother have told us to go on

5586597 are you nuts havent you watched georgian tv lately you better think long and hard about this or youll end up like a german reporter in moscow in 1941
5586598 i know the georgian people really well dont worry everything will be fine
5586599 will you write about how russian soldiers kidnapped a girl from a minibus
5586600 will you write how the russians are stealing everything that they can even toilets
5586601 or how the chechens are cutting the throats of our soldiers
5586602 they said they brought several georgian corpses who had their heads cut off to tbilisi today
5586603 didnt you know that our forces destroyed a chechen battalion and we destroyed hundreds of russian tanks the chechens are acting like animals it could be the cossacks too
5586604 do you have any idea what modern day cossacks look like why arent you saying anything about the victims in tskhinvali
5586605 why are the russians making fools of themselves and stealing toilets youre even stealing spoons
5586606 why do you think we brought tanks in to steal as many toilets as possible
5586607 wake up dont you understand how easily this is done this is a media war russia doesnt show looters on tv but we admit they exist and even claim to have shot several of them you dont have russian internet in georgia at the moment and havent seen the footage of how saakashvili was running from russian bombs and they arent showing us georgian refugee camps in russia theres a war going on at the moment and whats being broadcasted isnt objective information its pure hate
5586608 of course i wouldnt call the events that transpired in tskhinvali a genocide thats too loud a word but if the russians hadnt brought in their troops many more people would have died im worried about something else at the moment the worst is probably still ahead just like under gamsakhurdia the authorities are going to take this out on the local ossetians not now but soon
5586609 of course not the georgians know youre only protecting us
5586610 im worried that the georgians arent yet burying their dead
5586611 theyre keeping the bodies stored in morgues im afraid saakashvili could be getting ready to put on some horrible show he might organize mass graves and the georgians wont be able to hold themselves back any longer people may start writing hateful messages on russian homes
5586612 youre walking around with your notebook and just had an interview with an ossetian the russians are occupants and youre not interested in our point of view of course

5586654 marami rami na rin i had my first concert with journey early this year since then weve been touring
5586655 we really found time for the album it was neal and jonathan who wrote all the 11 new tracks on the album
5586656 we feel reborn i think theres a lot of chemistry between the five of us the new stuff sounds tremendous everyones so stoked about it we feel very fortunate to have found arnel
5586657 its nice to hear that im glad that they are happy with my work that im living up to their expectations i did the vocals for the album
5586658 arnel brings a soulful and passionate voice to journey his personality is very well suited to our music hes a sincere authentic person with a great smile and a big heart i think fans are really going to love him with arnels soaring tenor journey returns to our heritage sound
5586659 thats why i really did my best i didnt want to let them down and the journey fans who have been waiting for the album
5586660 okay naman po no problem they take good care of me and they really make me feel that im one of them we are like a family
5586661 as far as i can see its okay the audiences are very enthusiastic i can see that they are happy to see a new member blending very well with the group
5586662 wala yon i dont think criticisms or reactions like that will ever go away although i havent heard or seen anybody express that kind of reaction during our concerts i understand where those critics are coming from thats what they think thats what they believe in and i cant really do anything about i just focus on trying to please and entertain those who have faith in my talent i just ignore those who say negative comments against me whether im doing right or wrong they would still say the same things against me
5586663 not really to prove them wrong thats hard because there are fans who insist on what they want you to do what i consider a challenge is to prove that i am worthy as journeys new vocalist

5586666 people are stupid given proper motivation almost anyone will believe almost anything because people are stupid they will believe a lie because they want to believe it s true or because they re afraid it might be true peoples heads are full of knowledge facts and beliefs and most of it is false yet they think it all true people are stupid they can only rarely tell the difference between a lie and the truth and yet they are confident they can and so are all the easier to fool
5586667 the second rule is that the greatest harm can result from the best intentions
5586668 the wizards fourth rule he called it he said that there was magic in sincere forgiveness in the fourth rule magic to heal in forgiveness you grant and more so in the forgiveness you receive
5586669 mind what people do not only what they say for deeds will betray a lie
5586670 the most important rule there is the wizards sixth rule the only sovereign you can allow to rule you is reason the first law of reason is this what exists exists what is is and from this irreducible bedrock principle all knowledge is built it is the foundation from which life is embraced thinking is a choice wishes and whims are not facts nor are they a means to discover them reason is our only way of grasping reality it is our basic tool of survival we are free to evade the effort of thinking to reject reason but we are not free to avoid the penalty of the abyss that we refuse to see faith and feelings are the darkness to reasons light in rejecting reason refusing to think one embraces death
5586671 life is the future not the past the past can teach us through experience how to accomplish things in the future comfort us with cherished memories and provide the foundation of what has already been accomplished but only the future holds life to live in the past is to embrace what is dead to live life to its fullest each day must be created anew as rational thinking beings we must use our intellect not a blind devotion to what has come before to make rational choices
5586672 a contradiction can not exist in reality not in part nor in whole to believe in a contradiction is to abdicate your belief in the existence of the world around you and the nature of the things in it to instead embrace any random impulse that strikes your fancy to imagine something is real simply because you wish it were a thing is what it is it is itself there can be no contradictions faith is a device of self delusion a sleight of hand done with words and emotions founded on any irrational notion that can be dreamed up faith is the attempt to coerce truth to surrender to whim in simple terms it is trying to breath life into a lie by trying to outshine reality with the beauty of wishes faith is the refuge of fools the ignorant and the deluded not of thinking rational men in reality contradictions cannot exist to believe in them you must abandon the most important thing you possess your rational mind the wager for such a bargain is your life in such an exchange you always lose what you have at stake
5586673 determining what the priorities should be is not difficult militancy the economy and relations with india and afghanistan need to be addressed urgently
5586674 solutions however may prove more elusive but at the very least the politicians must show the same purpose and focus in dealing with the problems that they have demonstrated in taking on the president
5586675 the coalition must quickly nominate and elect a joint candidate as president and avoid lengthy political bargaining
5586676 it is time for the elected government to show people their ballots were not wasted
5586677 the coalition partners must demonstrate they are capable of insightful leadership political wisdom and can live up to the task of guiding the country with musharraf gone they no longer have an excuse for failure
5586678 the coalition has won an important battle so it has to work on an emergency basis to resolve the economic crisis and the announcement of a relief package for the people should be a government priority
5586679 his legacy is undeniably there and the good that he did must stand even though this is too emotional and passionate a moment to dwell on it with any degree of objectivity

5586681 id never done anything like it before and it was pretty daunting
5586682 all we expected to do on our first visit was to explore the possibilities but we achieved much more than that and the whole thing went fantastically well
5586683 the way pont works is to create sustainable improvements and not to try to introduce a quick fix and that is why we want to ensure that there are enough trainers in place
5586684 we really didnt expect to make such progress and it was very satisfying to be able to get so much done

5586699 he was a dictator and he had to go he ruled with the blessings of george bush and bush was the first to withdraw when musharraf needed help imagine bush refused to take his call
5586700 this has been the story of general ayub khan general zia ul haq and now general musharraf
5586701 they called him their ally in the war against terror and when the new political dispensation in pakistan went gunning for him the us was totally indifferent
5586702 his was fundamentally an illegitimate regime he ousted nawaz sharif and now nemesis came visiting him he must have no complaints every dictator says he staged a coup for the good of his country
5586703 any muslim ruler whether democratically elected or a dictator always faces the inevitable threat of us betrayal if he sides with them
5586704 they supported musharrafs dictatorship when they needed him they now say they are supporting democracy in pakistan and that is why musharraf had to go it is a logic nobody would buy
5586705 the fact of the matter is that the american government supports nobody but its own vested interests
5586706 he launched military operations against his own people he allowed the americans a free hand in arresting and jailing people of pakistan when they came under their suspicion
5586707 the fact is he used them and they used him and now since they no longer require him they have dumped him

5586710 is struggling to reclaim its revolutionary credentials in the face of massive electoral losses to an opposition party the mdc many of whose members are drawn from the ranks of the former liberation movement
5586711 he would not have allowed things to degenerate to this
5586712 he was not a power hungry person he fought for equality and justice and wanted to see all zimbabweans enjoying the same constitutional rights he was our favourite leader here in zimbabwe he had balls and was not afraid of mugabe or of speaking truth to power if you check our post independence history you will see that mugabe has always tried to erase his contribution in the liberation struggle is it because he was a threat to him
5586713 they believed in the idea that one day zimbabwe would be free thats what they fought for the ideas that they fought for are now being suppressed if they were here today maybe they would even go into another war we really have the animal farm situation where all animals are meant to be equal but in reality some animals are more equal than others what was promised to the people has not been delivered
5586714 he would say to me my friend i see the party changing people are busy here with estates with farms with huge places at borrowdale people are taking the party to the right
5586715 continuation of the ages old struggle of the working people
5586716 how could such a sharp change in direction have taken place
5586717 thus a party which was created by the workers of zimbabwe through the trade unions is now seen by the capitalist class as a possible instrument for carrying out the same discredited policies of mugabes government the capitalists in zimbabwe do not have their own party so they corrupt the workers party and try to use it to their advantage about a third of the mdcs national executive is made up of trade union leaders and activists and only nine of the mdcs elected mps come from a trade union background the rest are middle class academics lawyers some business people and one or two farmers and this non working class layer is playing an increasingly dominant role in deciding the policies of the party
5586718 mr makoni claims that most of leadership supports him none of the ruling partys heavyweights publicly admits to backing him they will almost certainly hedge their bets until the election but few have criticised him or tried to block his candidacy
5586719 the army police and much feared central intelligence organisation cio may no longer be united behind the 84 year old president
5586720 but it is pretty clear that the presidents popularity such as it is has been waning even among his old guard even if he somehow hangs on and lots of seasoned watchers think he will the mantra in harare is that something big has changed thanks to mr makonis challenge many of the ruling partys vultures clearly sense it is time to eye fresh pickings

5586773 i wonder if target is going to start selling burlap sacks for their back to school sale ridiculous stuff
5586774 its so b movie bad that you cant help but laugh at it
5586775 i am not sure how others will feel but striker was money on commentary for me
5586776 cole describing cenas style as pound and ground is ridiculous on so many levels
5586777 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
5586778 the worst thing about tonight was the rhodes dibiase defeat at the hands of cena
5586779 edge vs undertaker is the current match of the year and i dont get how anybody can say otherwise
5586780 was it just me or was cenas application of the stfu really sloppy and unbelievable
5586781 im a little late to get home this evening but its not that bad
5586782 it started getting smelly and i didnt want the guys facing any kind of danger so we decided to shut it down
5586783 it looks like the russians want that former soviet union back and its a little scary

5586792 the procedure is not one that would be recommended for everybody

5586794 ive always played football on the edge i thought i had to live like i played i was immature i dont have to be a wild and crazy guy i still love laughing im not going to do something if i cant have fun but now when i go out i can drink an odouls non alcoholic beer or something and ive got my girlfriend jordan so im not chasing women anymore im a homebody
5586795 but it was awfully funny god only knows what its going to be like when he really starts to feel comfortable
5586796 i wont shave until after camp my goal is to get it to where people will feel uncomfortable being around me the parents wont want their kids to take a picture with me women dont want to be alone around me
5586797 whats the first thing i told you when i got off the plane
5586798 they saw the changes in me they knew the man i had become and how ive grown but they still wanted to throw that back in my face hes still a risk that made me mad because heres your guy and youre seeing it first hand have my back they didnt do that
5586799 and hes a good football player but after that second one were not in a mood to do a long term contract
5586800 you have to sit down and talk to them get a good feel for them you just have to have that feeling that the persons right for the team as soon as we met jared we knew that
5586801 when you have a guy of his caliber available and its a very rare situation that you have that we jumped on the opportunity
5586802 we want to win championships i just had a good feeling
5586803 i needed to see what was going on with me
5586804 did i have a problem the main thing was that i was making bad decisions
5586805 whatever people think of me now thats what they think
5586806 i know where im at thats what i conveyed to them you guys dont know me i understand that youve got to ask questions but heres where im at the only way youre going to get to know me is to be around me i think they respected that
5586807 i hope he never takes another drink in his life
5586808 in the end we gave him what he wanted he got his freedom and he got himself the biggest contract ever for a defensive player in the history of the game
5586809 you think thats not going to happen to me because youre dense
5586810 your talent on the field might get you a second chance but what you do off the field is whats going to get you through your career
5586811 keep making mistakes and eventually people are going to get tired of it
5586812 he plays the run equally well for a 270 pound guy that speaks value hes not like former tampa bay buccaneers de simeon rice who you had to back up with a safety all the time and hes an all day sucker
5586813 youre a little concerned when you put a new guy in a group with some dominant players
5586814 but hes come and fit right in i wish the season started tomorrow just to toot the horn and kick the tires
5586815 guess thats the advantage of being short so i owed him one
5586816 in our room youve got to have thick skin so far hes been rolling with it
5586817 ive hit him so many times and thought i had him last year
5586818 i dont know how he got rid of that ball thats one thing on my list hes a good guy but because hes upper echelon it drives me so much more to put him on his back
5586819 im just glad theyre willing to let the past be the past and give him a chance i just hope that the cincinnati fans will give him the same type of chance

5586873 zum einen werden sich die investitionen in langfristig angelegte wachstumsinitiativen in den n chsten jahren auszahlen und positiv im ergebnis niederschlagen zum anderen haben wir beispielsweise mit der bank zweiplus oder der verbesserung des verh ltnisses zwischen back und front office massnahmen f r die weitere steigerung unserer kosteneffizienz ergriffen wir sind damit f r die zukunft ger stet

5586883 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5586884 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5586885 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5586886 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5586887 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5586888 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5586889 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5586890 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5586891 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5586892 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5586893 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5586894 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5586895 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5586896 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5586897 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5586898 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5586899 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5586900 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5586901 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5586902 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5586903 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5586904 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5586905 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5586906 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5586907 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5586908 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5586909 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5586910 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5586911 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5586912 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5586913 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5586914 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5586915 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5586916 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5586917 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5586918 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5586919 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5586920 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5586921 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5586922 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5586923 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5586924 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5586925 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5586926 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5586927 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5586928 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5586929 who are open to doing something on the production side
5586930 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5586931 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5586932 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5586933 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5586934 i think we are playing good technically physically and mentally
5586935 it was stiff and tight and it was getting tight after that last swing
5586936 ill see how he feels tuesday but this is something i am not really interested in playing around with i am not going to go out here and go through this every night
5586937 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5586938 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5586939 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5586940 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5586941 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5586942 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5586943 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5586944 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5586945 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5586946 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5586947 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5586948 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5586949 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5586950 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5586951 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5586952 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5586953 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5586954 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5586955 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5586956 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5586957 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5586958 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5586959 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5586960 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5586961 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5586962 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5586963 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5586964 not at all those guys have put up numbers before
5586965 whether quentin has done it in the minor leagues and alexei has done it in cuba these guys are capable of being great ballplayers and they are doing a heck of a job for us this year
5586966 our pitching was going good for quite a while and we were struggling with the bats
5586967 now it seems like were getting 12 or 15 hits a night and the pitching is starting to struggle or has been struggling for a little while
5586968 his ankle is still a little tender but at that point of the game we took him out not because of the ankle
5586969 i think we are playing good technically physically and mentally
5586970 we fought we gave it our best but we also made some stupid mistakes
5586971 he sort of realized that 30 of the big pie is better than 100 of the small pie
5586972 theres still the possibility of meeting somewhere in the middle
5586973 we think that the olympics will be another platform on which golfs story can be told
5586974 that kind of achievement is something that i think is something that would be special to our players
5586975 we want to see our sport become more universal were making good progress we can make more
5586976 we are not an industry that is going to shut down
5586977 we will have by 2016 a representation of the best players in the world from baseball
5586978 were fully wada compliant and were improving our testing programs
5586979 we think that the olympics will be another platform on which golfs story can be told
5586980 i think sergio garcia will probably notice the tear in rafael nadals eye at the gold medal ceremony and what it meant to him after winning wimbledon to come here and win a gold medal
5586981 that kind of achievement is something that i think is something that would be special to our players
5586982 we want to see our sport become more universal were making good progress we can make more

5586991 i mean hes got 14 of them hopefully i can bring one back to the city its just real good to see somebody else from baltimore participate in one of the biggest events in the world
5586992 we were more asking him what his plans are for upcoming competitions and when hes going to swim again because everyone wants to see him swim again
5586993 hes unbelievable ive know him for a little while we are the same age
5586994 i dont think what he did will ever be done again we play games every night and he swam twice a day every day for that length of time that was unbelievable

5587007 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5587008 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5587009 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5587010 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5587011 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5587012 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5587013 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5587014 now the dust has settled on the latest round of tariff announcements a more complex situation has emerged
5587015 consumers are faced with three choices first they wait and see but this could be at the risk of missing the last of the good deals second they take a capped tariff now and feel the security of knowing their outgoings albeit at higher prices than before or thirdly they get ready to start switching finding a new tariff after each price hike may be the best way to keep on top of rising prices by applying a little regular legwork

5587032 i need to do a better job ill give you straight talk with the young voters of america
5587033 my daughters i dont want them to ever confront a situation where they are disadvantaged because of their gender
5587034 its very clear the meaning is obvious sen obama in my opinion represents better
5587035 i feel that theres an opportunity for a lot of people not involved in the political process to make a difference
5587036 im passionate about this candidate i knew i needed to be participating and not just watching and hoping for the best

5587047 we expect airplanes to be less full and skies to be less crowded this labor day holiday
5587048 economic uncertainty and the heavy hit from sky high energy prices mean that many vacation and business travelers are choosing to stay closer to home if they go at all
5587049 on the customer service front airlines have been taking every conceivable step to minimize delays and improve operational efficiencies this focus has resulted in a decline in extended delays this year as compared to a year ago

5587072 the fire shall ever be burning upon the altar it shall never go out
5587073 keep the altar of private prayer burning this is the very life of all piety the sanctuary and family altars borrow their fires here therefore let this burn well secret devotion is the very essence evidence and barometer of vital and experimental religion burn here the fat of your sacrifices let your closet seasons be if possible regular frequent and undisturbed effectual prayer availeth much have you nothing to pray for let us suggest the church the ministry your own soul your children your relations your neighbours your country and the cause of god and truth throughout the world let us examine ourselves on this important matter do we engage with lukewarmness in private devotion is the fire of devotion burning dimly in our hearts do the chariot wheels drag heavily if so let us be alarmed at this sign of decay let us go with weeping and ask for the spirit of grace and of supplications let us set apart special seasons for extraordinary prayer for if this fire should be smothered beneath the ashes of a worldly conformity it will dim the fire on the family altar and lessen our influence both in the church and in the world the text will also apply to the altar of the heart this is a golden altar indeed god loves to see the hearts of his people glowing towards himself let us give to god our hearts all blazing with love and seek his grace that the fire may never be quenched for it will not burn if the lord does not keep it burning many foes will attempt to extinguish it but if the unseen hand behind the wall pour thereon the sacred oil it will blaze higher and higher let us use texts of scripture as fuel for our hearts fire they are live coals let us attend sermons but above all let us be much alone with jesus

5587092 how could we have such a low view of the gospel of jesus christ that we have to manipulate men psychologically to get them to come down and pray a prayer
5587093 were just trying to attract people and then well gradually bring them in further and further
5587094 pray for me that i may be made holier and wiser less like myself and more like my heavenly master that i may not regard my life if so be i may finish my course with joy this day eleven years ago i lost my loved and loving brother and began to seek a brother who cannot die
5587095 read part of the life of jonathan edwards how feeble does my spark of christianity appear beside such a sun but even his was a borrowed light and the same source is still open to enlighten me
5587096 if nothing else will do to sever me from my sins lord send me such sore and trying calamities as shall awake me from earthly slumbers it must always be best to be alive to thee whatever be the quickening instrument
5587097 do everything in earnest if it is worth doing then do it with all your might above all keep much in the presence of god never see the face of man till you have seen his face who is our life our all
5587098 he might have risen to high eminence in the circles of taste and literature but denied himself all such hopes that he might win souls
5587099 i hope and pray that it may be his will to restore me again to you and your parish with a heart tutored by sickness to speak more and more as dying to dying
5587100 that text of jude has peculiar beauties for me at this season if it be good to come under the love of god once surely it is good to keep ourselves there any yet how reluctant we are
5587101 one thing always fills the cup of my consolation that god may work by the meanest and poorest words as well as by the most polished and ornate yea perhaps more readily that the glory may be all his own
5587102 o lord make me hang on thee to open their hearts thou opener of lydias heart i fear thou wilt not bless my preaching until i am brought thus to hang on thee
5587103 he has set me down among the noisy mechanics and political weavers of this godless town he will make the money sufficient he that paid his taxes from a fishs mouth will supply all my need
5587104 speak to your people as on the brink of eternity
5587105 if the veil of the worlds machinery were lifted off how much we would find is done in answer to the prayers of gods children
5587106 use your health while you have it my dear friend and brother do not cast away peculiar opportunities that may never come again you know not when your last sabbath with your people may come speak for eternity above all things cultivate your own spirit a word spoken by you when your conscience is clear and your heart full of gods spirit is worth ten thousand words spoken in unbelief and sin
5587107 i have no desire but the salvation of my people by whatever instrument
5587108 now remember moses wist not that the skin of his face shone looking at our own shining face is the bane of the spiritual life and of the ministry o for closest communion with god till soul and body head face and heart shine with divine brilliancy but o for a holy ignorance of our shining
5587109 christ gives last knocks when your heart becomes hard and careless then fear lest christ may have given a last knock
5587110 i earnestly long for more grace and personal holiness and more usefulness
5587111 i ought to see that in christs bloodshedding there is an infinite overpayment for all my sins
5587112 i often pray lord make me as holy as a pardoned sinner can be made
5587113 how many purposes god has in view of which we know nothing
5587114 take heed to thyself your own soul is your first and greatest care
5587115 keep up close communion with god study likeness to him in all things
5587116 i know well that when christ is nearest satan also is busiest
5587117 i feel there are two things it is impossible to desire with sufficient ardour personal holiness and the honour of christ in the salvation of souls
5587118 it is not great talents god blesses so much as great likeness to jesus a holy minister is an awful weapon in the hand of god
5587119 live near to god and so all things will appear to you little in comparison with eternal realities
5587120 even those that are most deeply concerned about their souls do not see the millionth part of the blackness of their hearts and lives
5587121 every wave of trouble has been wafting you to the sunny shores of a sinless eternity
5587122 do not think any sin trivial remember it will have everlasting consequences
5587123 go on dear brother but an inch of time remains and then eternal ages roll on for ever but an inch on which we can stand and preach the way of salvation to a perishing world
5587124 the possession of grace fills us with very different feelings from the possession of anything else a man who has much money is not very anxious that all the world should be rich one who has much learning does not long that all the world were learned but if you have tasted the grace of the gospel the irresistible longing of your hearts will be o that all the world might taste its regenerating waters
5587125 learn much of the lord jesus for every look at yourself take ten looks at christ he is altogether lovely
5587126 spared fig trees should bear much fruit pray that it may be so with me
5587127 luther used to say that temptations afflictions and prayer made a minister
5587128 pray to be taught to pray do not be content with old forms that flow from the lips only most christians have need to cast their formal prayers away to be taught to cry abba
5587129 remember also the present is your only time to be saved there is no believing no repenting no conversion in the grave no minister will speak to you there this is the time of conversion
5587130 our god can work through means or above them he that puts the treasure into earthen vessels often allows the vessels to be chipped and broken that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us
5587131 if you had an angels righteousness you might well lay it down and put on jesus the robe of a blood washed sinner is far whiter than that of an angel
5587132 i long for love without any coldness light without dimness and purity without spot or wrinkle i long to be at jesus feet and tell him i am all his and ever will be
5587133 do you not feel your heart lighter now as you walk on the narrow way is not a christians darkest hour calmer than the worlds brightest
5587134 one smile from jesus sustains my soul amid all the storms and frowns of this passing world pray to know jesus better
5587135 do not fear the face of man remember how small their anger will appear in eternity
5587136 you have heard the law that says love your neighbor and hate your enemy but i say love your enemies pray for those who persecute you in that way you will be acting as true children of your father in heaven for he gives his sunlight to both the evil and the good and he sends rain on the just and the unjust alike if you love only those who love you what reward is there for that even corrupt tax collectors do that much if you are kind only to your friends how are you different from anyone else even pagans do that but you are to be perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect
5587137 la paz es la columna vertebral del islam es una religi n de paz existe una campa a propagand stica para asociarlo a pr cticas terroristas pero es una gran confusi n
5587138 debemos estudiar por qu ciertas fracciones est n reaccionando de forma violenta y contraria a la religi n del islam pero el cor n dice tu religi n contigo y la m a conmigo es una cultura de respeto mutuo y respeto a las dem s pr cticas religiosas
5587139 en el caso de cachemira como en el de chechenia o palestina el conflicto religioso es tan s lo el s ntoma visible
5587140 la verdadera ra z del enfrentamiento son siempre intereses estrat gicos militares y econ micos manipulados por grupos pol ticos

5587153 if your heart takes more pleasure in reading novels or watching tv or going to the movies or talking to friends rather than just sitting alone with god and embracing him sharing his cares and his burdens weeping and rejoicing with him then how are you going to handle forever and ever in his presence youd be bored to tears in heaven if youre not ecstatic about god now
5587154 do not have your concert first and then tune your instrument afterwards begin the day with the word of god and prayer and get first of all into harmony with him
5587155 perhaps if there were more of that intense distress for souls that leads to tears we should more frequently see the results we desire sometimes it may be that while we are complaining of the hardness of the hearts of those we are seeking to benefit the hardness of our own hearts and our feeble apprehension of the solemn reality of eternal things may be the true cause of our want of success
5587156 since the days of pentecost has the whole church ever put aside every other work and waited upon him for ten days that the spirits power might be manifested we give too much attention to method and machinery and resources and too little to the source of power
5587157 the power of prayer has never been tried to its full capacity in any church
5587158 call unto me and i will answer thee and show thee great and mighty things which thou knows not
5587159 do we give sufficient attention to the theme of gaining christ it is our joy and privilege to know him as gods unspeakable gift but none knew this more fully than the apostle paul but was he satisfied with this knowledge or was pauls soul consuming desire at all possible cost to gain christ and thus to know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings oh that christ may be so known by us as a living bright reality that our one desire our one absorbing heart passion may be that we personally gain christ that we personally know him as the apostle longed to do
5587160 all gods giants have been weak men who did great things for god because they believed that god would be with them
5587161 i myself for instance am not especially gifted and am shy by nature but my gracious and merciful god and father inclined himself to me and when i was weak in faith he strengthened me while i was still young he taught me in my helplessness to rest on him and to pray even about little things in which another might have felt able to help himself
5587162 the branch of the vine does not worry and toil and rush here to seek for sunshine and there to find rain no it rests in union and communion with the vine and at the right time and in the right way is the right fruit found on it let us so abide in the lord jesus
5587163 to every toiling heavy laden sinner jesus says come to me and rest
5587164 in shansi i found chinese christians who were accustomed to spend time in fasting and prayer they recognized that this fasting which so many dislike which requires faith in god since it makes one feel weak and poorly is really a divinely appointed means of grace perhaps the greatest hindrance to our work is our own imagined strength and in fasting we learn what poor weak creatures we are dependent on a meal of meat for the little strength which we are so apt to lean upon
5587165 i have found that there are three stages in every great work of god first it is impossible then it is difficult then it is done
5587166 so many people live within unhappy circumstances and yet will not take the initiative to change their situation because they are conditioned to a life of security conformity and conservatism all of which may appear to give one peace of mind but in reality nothing is more dangerous to the adventurous spirit within a man than a secure future the very basic core of a mans living spirit is his passion for adventure the joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon for each day to have a new and different sun
5587167 some people feel like they dont deserve love they walk away quietly into empty spaces trying to close the gaps of the past
5587168 if we admit that human life can be ruled by reason then all possibility of life is destroyed
5587169 rather than love than money than faith than fame than fairness give me truth
5587170 mr franz i think careers are a 20th century invention and i dont want one
5587171 i see that unless i keep up short prayer every day throughout the whole day at intervals i lose the spirit of prayer i would never lose sight any hour of the lamb in the midst of the throne and if i have this sight i shall be able to pray
5587172 o brother pray in spite of satan pray spend hours in prayer rather neglect friends than not pray rather fast and lose breakfast dinner tea and supper and sleep too than not pray and we must not talk about prayer we must pray in right earnest the lord is near he comes softly while the virgins slumber
5587173 why is there so little forethought in the laying out of time and employment so as secure a large portion of each day for prayer why is there so much speaking yet so little prayer why is there so much running to and fro to meetings conventions fellowship gatherings and yet so little time for prayer brethren why so many meetings with our fellow men and so few meetings with god
5587174 oh dont worry we met some american missionaries yesterday who we repeated a prayer with and so we know were going to heaven
5587175 it was seven years before carey baptised his first convert in india it was seven years before judson won his first disciple in burma morrison toiled seven years before the chinaman was brought to christ moffat declares that he waited seven years to see the first evident moving of the holy spirit upon his bechuanas of africa henry richards wrought seven years on the congo before the first convert was gained at banza manteka

5587218 the general situation of moroccos prison inmates especially those on death row is absolutely catastrophic and inhumane
5587219 humidity is causing serious illnesses such as asthma skin and eye diseases
5587220 the ever present threat of execution for those on death row is also causing serious mental illnesses
5587221 its up to the whim of the prison authorities whether medicines are authorised
5587222 and when they are issued it is always cheap medicines and weeks late
5587223 this is far from their families it really amounts to a form of collective punishment
5587224 prisoners are being served up food thats not even fit for sewer rats
5587225 there are actually no education and reintegration programmes for these inmates

5587229 are we all politicians in darjeeling hills every single individual is a politician
5587230 gl number plates compulsory for all private and government vehicles from 25th of august
5587231 it will be compulsory for all private and government vehicles to use gl plates from the 25th of august
5587232 our president mr bimal gurung has asked us to enforce the implementation of the said programme and maintain a watch on it presently the governmental agencies have been using taxis after dumping their official vehicles we will now implement gl plates even on taxis so that these government officials will be forced to use vehicles with gl registration plates all private vehicles will also have to use gl plates after the 25th of august some vehicle owners are using papers pasted on the vehicle they will have to use standard tin plates with gl vehicle registration number our cadres will be keeping a close watch on everything
5587233 naturally this is supposed to be illegal this is part of our non cooperation movement we are no longer cooperating with the west bengal government instead we are setting up our own home rule and we have been forced to do all these because the west bengal government is not bothered about our demand for gorkhaland the have been indignant to us and hence we have started our own home rule now all governmental vehicles will also compulsorily use gorkhaland vehicle registration numbers

5587265 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers
5587266 if the fact that they were showing up on problem lists for a year doesnt make them high risk i dont know what does
5587267 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
5587268 somebody could have picked up a box and looked at peppers if they wanted to but im not sure that would have been a high priority
5587269 it would require a big leap to think that salmonella in dried peppers could be related to problems in fresh chilies
5587270 if so many of the peppers we eat in the u s come in from mexico youd think we would want to pay more attention
5587271 more than 200 works of art disappeared after the invasion of baghdad in 2003

5587278 individuals taking antidepressants should be aware of the possible cognitive effects as they may affect performance in social academic and work settings as well as driving abilities

5587293 we do not think the political issues are all resolved the key question remains how well the two major coalition partners can cooperate without conflict and focus on turning around the economy

5587544 from the beginning the people of the south south have expressed their opposition to the former president olusegun obasanjos plan to pipe gas from the region to the olokonla plant between ondo and ogun states which he built to spite our people his regime could not however carry out the plan because our youths threatened to blow up the pipeline
5587545 in fact anything that will stop the people of the niger delta from benefiting from their natural resources should be avoided
5587546 it is in doing this kind of thing that the oil companies that operate in our region set up their head offices in lagos some of their workers even come to work in the niger delta from lagos at the end of the month they collect their salaries and pay tax to the lagos state government we are tired of all these type of things and that is why we said long ago that all the oil companies should relocate their headquarters from lagos to the niger delta
5587547 i dont know the mechanism they want to use but all i can tell you is that such a policy is not in the interest of the niger delta people you cannot be producing gas in the niger delta and be piping to lagos without developing our gas plants
5587548 in the first instance i want to tell you from the point of view of the iyc that it is impossible to pipe gas from niger delta states to lagos
5587549 if they are talking about security challenge in the niger delta it is the government that created it in the first instance through its inadequacies and it should address it but i want to state for the avoidance of doubt that the issue of piping gas to lagos wont work it is a dream they are wasting time simple and short
5587550 overall the main threats to peace and stability emanate from the law and order maintenance issues
5587551 much still needs to be done urgently to strengthen the capacities of both the police and the army and facilitate their effective presence in the country
5587552 it has created a stronger incentive for illegal exploitation of natural resources particularly minerals and rubber
5587553 unmil will be able to continue to discharge its mandate of maintaining a stable and secure environment and providing the necessary security umbrella throughout the country to enable the government to continue its reform and restructuring programme
5587554 let it be stated that efcc will continue to investigate any corruption case in any sector of nigeria
5587555 however there is no truth whatsoever in the report that mrs farida waziri interrogated or quizzed rt hon bankole during her visit to his office over the weekend
5587556 rather the executive chairman held a 30 minute meeting with the speaker as part of efforts towards fostering greater relationship between the commission and the lawmakers
5587557 the commission therefore found the report embarrassing and urges journalists to always cross check their facts before publishing
5587558 first of all let me say that the efcc as far as the leadership is concerned is not after any member that we know secondly the visit of the efcc chairman to the speaker had nothing to do with investigation rather it has to do with support
5587559 first she came on courtesy call and then she followed it up by calling for support for a bill that they are proposing to the house that will empower the efcc to confiscate or go after properties of officers or individuals that are convicted by law
5587560 let me say again that when she came on saturday i think the speaker was just here informally and she was here not more than 30 minutes
5587561 then there is this issue in the pages of some newspapers of saturday on the purchase of cars let me say that as most of you know am a member of the leadership and a strong member of the leadership i dont know how much each car was purchased
5587562 as far as the leadership is concerned we dont have any member and any member for that matter or any staff of the national assembly not to the knowledge of the leadership
5587563 secondly the issue of the cars purchased the leadership has no problem with that it was a resolution of the house to buy cars for oversight work and we asked the management to do that through direct purchase from pan
5587564 the issue of quotation does not even arise because we have only one pan so the issue of having a middle man or someone in between did not arise at all i think these things are very clear
5587565 i do not see how a courtesy visit of the chairman of the efcc would amount to a quizzing of our speaker the press should help the speaker build a house that will be the pride of every nigerian
5587566 first we wish to state that rt hon bankole is in full support of the anti corruption drive of president umaru musa yaraduas administration and will be ready to support any action that could strengthen the anti corruption agencies
5587567 we are aware of some people working towards undermining the integrity of rt
5587568 contrary to the report of your newspaper the efcc chairman mrs farida waziri visited the speaker and had a 30 minute meeting instead of your reported five hours and characteristically the efcc chairman came alone with her car and a back up vehicle
5587569 you may also want to know that as i write there is no petition from the house of representatives at the efcc
5587570 all views expressed above do not necessarily reflect the views of any of the parties mentioned they only reflect the views of anthony e mckeown

5587575 you need a captain more in the bad times than the good
5587576 that is when you need someone who steps forward and takes responsibility
5587577 we have got so many leaders in the squad now
5587578 i am sure whoever takes the armband there will still be another five or six leaders taking us forward on the pitch

5587674 most notably the water issues have become even more pressing with the public in light of the recent drought
5587675 youre going to have cyclical rainfall and what this does is looks at it more long term rather than just at specific drought conditions

5587733 this is the first study that shows the contribution of ships to fine particulates in the atmosphere
5587734 ships are really unregulated when it comes to air pollution standards what we wanted to find out was the contribution of ships to the air pollution in san diego and what we found was a surprise because no one expected that the contribution from ships of solid sulfur rich particles called primary sulfate would be so high
5587735 but our results suggest that this component of ship emissions is important and should not be ignored in the future knowing how much sulfate from ships is in the air will also allow us to better understand what happens to the other 93 percent of sulfur emitted by ships

5587740 im in the final but right now im still a bit mad with myself
5587741 when have i ever had an easy ride never once i just accept that im never going to have an easy ride ill be fine
5587742 i believed i could do it on the first jump but then you start having the doubts and then you kind of panic and go through every single emotion you can possibly think of
5587743 all it comes down to is trusting what youve been doing every single day in training thats what my coach told me and i just had to believe in myself and trust it and then take a big breath slow everything down and then i got it
5587744 thats job done im pleased ive got the feel for the track and im looking forward to the final
5587745 im just looking to perform to the best of my ability so i can walk off the track like i have done today and be satisfied with what ive done
5587746 i think 64 or 65 metres could make a medal and im capable of that so im looking to throw as far as i possibly can and if i can walk away with a medal ill be ecstatic
5587747 im pleased to get the first one over with it was nerve racking because ive not run for a while but im happy enough
5587748 i dont want to be the vice president i am not going to be the nominee
5587749 we would be foolish to rule out the fact that they may have been planning an attack
5587750 let there be no doubt these are dangerous individuals these men were not simply in possession of material which expressed extremist views they were also in possession of material that was operationally useful to anyone wishing to carry out an act of violence or terrorism
5587751 we found that if a teacher has a high achieving group of students pushing them harder by giving them more homework could be beneficial
5587752 similarly if a teacher has a low ability class assigning more homework may help since they may not have been pushed hard enough
5587753 given these students abilities and time constraints learning by doing may be a more effective tool for improvement
5587754 there has been an extensive amount of research examining the influences of students achievement but it has been primarily focused on financial inputs such as class size or teachers credentials
5587755 our study examined the affect that additional homework has on test scores
5587756 this does not mean that homework is unimportant for average achievers
5587757 but it does mean that this population may also benefit from other activities such as sports art or music rather than additional hours of math homework
5587758 we hope that through our designs people will start to become more observant of themselves and realize that our local culture is rich and colorful in its own right
5587759 fashion and dress have always been part and parcel of social change
5587760 if we use elements of local culture its not so much a way of expressing thai ness but more about placing things found around us that might be funny or surprising
5587761 the prevalence of capitalist consumer culture from the west has meant that theres a move toward a regional identity
5587762 i think leaving it long on top would be nice
5587763 they are both still in calculations nathan has done a little bit more today in our skills session from a running point of view than browny did
5587764 its only early in the week and we will give both those boys an opportunity to come up later in the week but nathan foley is ahead of nathan brown at the minute
5587765 browny has had two or three on going problems over three or four weeks
5587766 one is from a knock to the leg and the other is from a knock to the hip they were both collision injuries but fortunately the leg knock is to his other leg his good leg
5587767 it was pretty important from a self belief point of view for our guys to know they can compete with sides that have been right up there
5587768 as much as i can sit here and say i believe in our younger players for them to see it for themselves is important and it helps sell the message to ourselves that we have been trying to portray all along
5587769 when you are in a situation lower down the ladder and we were there last year and knocked off a couple of sides you have got that nothing to lose attitude and you can go out and play with a bit of freedom
5587770 and you dont tighten up because there is nothing to tighten up over
5587771 well just focus on the match we will not be disturbed by the audience
5587772 i always relive it winning the athens gold medal over and over even though it was four years ago it still feels like im there
5587773 so many people have been worried and caring about me i feel sorry i could do nothing but pull out of the race
5587774 i didnt feel right when i was warming up before the race i knew my foot would fail me
5587775 i am not that type of person i never quit easily i believe i will come back
5587776 from him from his tenacious struggle with injuries over the years his last minute attempt to defeat the pains in particular we saw fine sportsmanship at work
5587777 i am not thinking about gold medals or about making history really
5587778 i just focus on the track to beat my rivals one by one i try to do it simply just get on the track and ride
5587779 i came out with as little effort as possible i felt comfortable i just wanted to win the heat with as little effort as possible and just not take any chances
5587780 i like to see where im at why she looks at the screen and not slow down too much
5587781 i was pretty mad but i had to get over it
5587782 it was pretty good always work the beginning and if i had to go go but not too much
5587783 i feel pretty good i think everybody is a little sluggish it was just one of those days
5587784 im glad i finally got that first race out of the way
5587785 it wasnt as bad as i dreamed it would be i got out there and it was just like any other meet just dont look at the third level of the stadium seating
5587786 my point was to forget about what happened in the prelims and i did i came in this morning and its a brand new day and i felt better and mentally i felt much better than i did yesterday
5587787 i came back to priorities and what to think about at the right moment and it seems to be working out better for me
5587788 if we should be able to play close from the beginning for sure yao ming should play a longer time but there was no reason to keep him on the court
5587789 yao fought he wants to play and wants to help us as much as possible but he is a player and i am the coach i make those decisions
5587790 i talked with him only a moment and what he said i could not print in the press
5587791 you could say he was not happy at all with jonas
5587792 theres going to be a lot of service old i can tell you that
5587793 it was a difficult decision but i want to recover in time for the us open
5587794 i am playing with great confidence it could not have come at a better time

5587851 o imperador adriano a caminho dos campos de batalha passou por um jardim e viu um velho plantando uma figueira freando o cavalo perguntou por que trabalhas t o assiduamente nesta idade esperas comer os frutos da rvore que est s plantando respondeu o velho se for a vontade de dus eu os comerei do contr rio os desfrutar o meus filhos tr s anos depois o imperador passou pelo mesmo lugar o mesmo velho adiantou se e apresentou lhe um cesto de figos dizendo meu senhor dignai vos a receber esta d diva eu sou o homem a quem falaste h tr s anos comovido o imperador mandou encher o cesto com pe as de ouro e devolv lo ao velho laborioso sucedeu estar a mulher de um vizinho em casa do anci o quando este voltou com o ouro ouvindo o relato ela ordenou imediatamente ao marido que enchesse um cesto de frutos de todos os tipos e o levasse ao imperador ele gosta da fruta da terra e em recompensa pode encher te o cesto de moedas de ouro o homem seguiu o conselho e apresentou a oferenda ao soberano dizendo majestade ouvi dizer que gostais de frutos e trouxe vos estes para que os saboreeis sabendo do caso e indignado pela aud cia do homem o imperador ordenou aos soldados que atirassem os frutos cara do atrevido arranhado quase cego o astucioso chegou casa como te foste perguntou ansiosamente a mulher muito bem respondeu se fosse lim es eu n o estaria vivo

5587860 the afghan national army is saying that anytime we get close to them they detonate themselves
5587861 i think state senator leticia van de putte said it best we need someone to intercede on behalf of barack obama and the person that south texans trust more than anyone else is hillary clinton
5587862 so when im in denver i will be talking to the campaign people ill be talking to the hispanic caucus leadership to get this commitment we need hillary
5587863 many people have not decided they are waiting to see who obama is going to choose for vice president if he does not choose mrs clinton they say they are not going to vote for him he has to do the right thing because the majority of the people want hillary
5587864 it will be a landslide if he chooses mrs clinton
5587865 the obama people have made a decision they believe she clinton will bring some negatives to the campaign i do not agree with that i believe the benefits far outweigh the negatives but they are the experts they are the ones who pulled this off we have to respect that we are team players

5587913 normally shahid likes to take a break for every film but this year has been different after kens film he went straight to a workshop with vishal bhardwaj and now hes shooting for vishals film after that he starts yash rajs next in fact shahid who is in pune shooting for kaminay went a day earlier to acquaint himself with the race track and the people around he shot a scene where hes betting at the track and another where he commits a robbery for shahid it was a complete revelation he has never stepped into a race course in is life

5587923 it is envisaged that the tamar will arrive on station at the mumbles in 2011
5587924 i dont even have to be involved in the future
5587925 yes shabana and my father are in the film in fact everyone you know in the industry is going to be in luck by chance everyone breezes in and breezes out in different parts of the film but luck by chance is not a spoof on the film industry a lot of the film fraternity will recognise itself in the film
5587926 zoya has completed the principal photography its turned out exactly the way we had imagined it the film has me isha sharvani and also rishi kapoor and dimple kapadia though not as a pair i do play one of the leads but its a menagerie of characters and activities the structure is totally new
5587927 luck by chance is set in the film industry and farhan and zoya asked all their friends which means practically the whole industry to do walk on parts unlike om shanti om which got the stars in only for a song this one has space all through for stars to walk in and out
5587928 this one lends itself well to playback singing i got to do a lot of singing in rock on id say luck by chance helped me open up as an actor rock on was a role i could easily identify with but i had to work a lot harder for my sister
5587929 ive been taking instructions from her all my life ive always obeyed her i just had to go from being her designated driver to a designated actor
5587930 fortunately zoya was always open to suggestions and there would be quite a lot of give and take on the sets
5587931 actually ive worked with directors aaron and jason a bunch of times on epic movie date movie the very first scary movie and now disaster movie
5587932 its just fun fun to work with them and i was excited to actually get a chance to work with kim we had a lot of fun
5587933 this was my first movie and id just heard that jason and aaron are just the most amazing directors to work with and they really were they brought something out of me that i didnt think i really had at first and totally built my confidence level in acting i auditioned for the role and i got it and was really excited to work with them i play three different characters i play a girl named lisa who is just one of the main characters and the movie is about a bunch of kids who are getting out of the city because all these natural disasters are happening
5587934 carmen and i have a big scene together where we spoof the wwe divas and we have a big battle
5587935 well you know we actually get along really well so it was kind of weird you know but we had fun with it we had choreography so we just got in the ring and just went for it but you know we would ask each other are you ok after pulling each others hair out
5587936 she pulled my hair and she was like are you ok and im like yeah im fine
5587937 it was really fun i dont know i feel a second career in wrestling
5587938 im sort of spoofing angelina jolie in wanted or more so the character
5587939 but i dont know i always feel weird i would never want to personally spoof or make fun of anyone if anything in these movies im making fun of myself and showing people that i have a good sense of humour about myself and my own image
5587940 definitely i was watching her do some of her scenes and im like shes so comfortable ok calm down i was nervous at first but then just with everyone we were working with they made it so comfortable and so easy that you just had to be natural it was like a family working together it was so much fun i love it now i went into it being really nervous thinking ok i just have to get through this its my first movie i really hope that im going to be on a new set its not like filming my show where its just my family and who cares what we really do theres a whole cast and crew of people that are depending on you to get your line right and to get everything right or you have to do it all over again because you messed up but i did it i remembered all my lines
5587941 you can kind of get away with more i think in movies
5587942 you get to experience more things which is fun in reality we probably wouldnt end up wrestling in a ring with no clothes
5587943 we are now faced with other types of difficulties crime fraud lies arrogance self enrichment economic meltdown and rising poverty what is there left for us but to adopt gandhis principles to bring about some sanity in our country
5587944 the blood gushed out and was all over my face it took a while for everyone to realise i was injured
5587945 fortunately the cut is hidden by my hair so no continuity problems
5587946 working with a living legend like subhash ghai in yuvraj is such a privilege its a tearjerker a drama about relationships its the quintessential bollywood film and my other forthcoming film blue is just the opposite experience its a get happy adventure sporty film
5587947 im also doing a romantic comedy with vashu bhagnani i havent done one of those i was dying to do it
5587948 im aware of my dads track record but im not just looking to equal his track record im hoping to better it
5587949 but seriously today the box office has changed so much things were different in my dads times the relationships within the industry and definitions of success have changed today you cant walk on the road without a camera following you you either love it or you dont but im not scared of the future ill keep trying until i succeed
5587950 am i thats surprising anyway let the others have fun im happy being devoted to malaika

5587979 that kind of achievement is something that i think is something that would be special to our players
5587980 three years ago baseball and softball became the first sports dropped from the games since polo in 1936 international softball federation president don porter knows the sport needs to stretch its international reach

5587992 the government had been blaming musharraf for inflation power cuts and the weak economy and since now he has resigned we hope that the government will take steps to make our life better

5588075 determining what the priorities should be is not difficult militancy the economy and relations with india and afghanistan need to be addressed urgently

5588092 nesting catalogs under other catalogs is now a standard feature of ekp
5588093 a hierarchical catalog view means a course can be listed in more than one catalog this feature is extremely useful in e commerce document management applications and multiple groups or business units where they need to be precisely managed
5588094 for example the new learning path feature presents a graphical layout of the courses currently assigned to learners this makes it easier to view items in course assignments that need action are in process or have been completed
5588095 clients conducting classes using webex virtual classroom can also use ekp to coordinate classes and keep track of user enrollments and scores
5588096 we even made the e commerce interface more intuitive walking the buyer through the whole process
5588097 our ultimate goal is to give our clients an easier and more convenient experience with ekp so they can focus on learning each upgrade takes us one step closer to that goal
5588098 in the very few moments when i can think clear i want to do everything possible to make sure that everyone responsible for this tragedy spends the rest of their lives in jail
5588099 i was speaking to her on wednesday 12 20 p m
5588100 she said they had a trip that was so much fun
5588101 i think it was a river i could hear flowing water magda was terrified of water

5588105 this is a temporary measure in place until the department develops a long term solution to cool truck cabs in the summer months
5588106 on hot days it is common for firefighters to put water coolers on fire engines and the fire department has a special team the rehab and care unit that responds to fire scenes to hydrate firefighters

5588116 part of rehab is to bend and stretch and do things that are very painful
5588117 the traditional approach to modelocking is to use a two section device one section to provide optical gain the other to act as a saturable absorber
5588118 we have been investigating a single section device which is modelocked over the entire current range above threshold
5588119 we now have excellent control of the dot growth producing high dot densities with narrow size distributions resulting in a high performance gain medium
5588120 this allows the observation of self pulsation and the high peak powers required to observe dual band modelocking
5588121 the splitting of the laser peak at twice threshold is purely a coincidence
5588122 we believe the splitting is decided by the intracavity ac stark effect with the separation between peaks being twice the rabi frequency once the rabi frequency which is dependent on the intracavity laser intensity is comparable with the initial lasing linewidth we observe the dual wavelength modelocking
5588123 the asaish are saying they will annex kirkuk by force and that is terrifying people
5588124 negotiations here are you give me everything i want and i will walk away happy
5588125 it is hard for us to appreciate the level of ethnic hatred
5588126 they are more rapid that is why they are much more active than the police
5588127 the asaish have lots of sources and thats why the americans depend on them and the police depend on them that might explain why they have more power
5588128 they have a major role combating terrorism but the problem is they are loyal to the political parties

5588132 i have not packed my bags i want to stay here i want compensation from the government
5588133 i do not have anywhere to go and i will be killed if i go into the townships the south africans hate us
5588134 they have removed the toilets and the police trucks are waiting to deport us
5588135 the numbers have since declined and we are still updating the figures
5588136 some of them were found to illegal and due process is taking place to deport them while some have qualified for refugee status and will be reintegrated into south african society
5588137 there is no reasonable belief that persecution will occur if you return to your country
5588138 i have washed and packed my clothes i want to go to mozambique some people want to go back to the shacks in the townships but i want to go home rather than die in the hands of south africans
5588139 because we are in such a system we are always asking ourselves whether we are brainwashed
5588140 we are always eager to get other information from different channels

5588206 foundational because the act of dehumanizing and killing the unborn child attacks human dignity in a uniquely grave way
5588207 we become what the word of god has such disgust for salt that has lost its flavor
5588208 think of it as a foxy summer fling except you know without the real life burden of gut wrenching heartbreak and disease

5588218 abuses are often based on ignorance in that they involve a rejection of those elements whose deeper meaning are not understood
5588219 celebrating community does not have to re invent the sacred rites in every age
5588220 not infrequently abuses are rooted in a false sense of liberty yet god has not granted us a liberty by which we may do what we wish but a liberty by which we may do what is fitting and right
5588221 to ignore the norms of the mass is to sow seeds of discord and division
5588222 it is to be remembered that the eucharistic sacrifice and indeed the sacred liturgy as a whole are not something that we make or invent or put together on our own

5588226 but a few years ago i asked some students if they knew what watergate was and they said that was where monica lewinsky lived

5588228 the green bay packers almost always had the same quarterback
5588229 i mean for as long as i can remember brett favre was the man there

5588255 we have to deny russian strategic objectives which are clearly to undermine georgias democracy to use its military capability to damage and in some cases destroy georgian infrastructure and to try and weaken the georgian state
5588256 i think you can expect a strong message to russia
5588257 decisions by nato will be balanced and that responsible forces in the west will give up the total cynicism that has been so evident which is pushing us back to the cold war era

5588259 i have been preparing for olympics since the past three years undergoing strenuous training and several tests none of the tests were found positive except for the june 6 sample collected in pune
5588260 it sai must have definitely manipulated my sample otherwise how could other samples taken just about a fortnight later be negative if it is not the great indian dope trick then what is it
5588261 moreover if i am tested positive why was i still kept in olympic camp for more than two months

5588279 thanks to the efforts by the villages service team we have received 49 compliment letters and no complaints
5588280 it was the largest number in olympic history we served all the guests well during the peak hours
5588281 we offered 300 ducks every day at the beginning but now we raised the number to 600 to meet demand
5588282 although as ernesto guevara said friendship ends where duty starts and we are representing the venezuelan people here
5588283 we have spent a lot of time in cuba we even know the players homes it is the cuban school of the past 40 years that we stand for so we had mixed feelings in todays game

5588293 what i have learnt here is that i will not leave everything to luck yes i wanted to win the medal here but olympics are not the end of the road for me olympic has an aura and it sets your pulse racing and that is why i wanted to be in the finals this time but that was not to be and you have to live with this fact
5588294 today physically i was unstable i lost lot of 9s because of lack of proper balance and by the time i realised it was already very late
5588295 we would be foolish to rule out the fact that they may have been planning an attack

5588308 the russians will invent all kinds of excuses pretexts not to pull back their troops
5588309 they will rename themselves peacekeepers maintain their positions in the security zone
5588310 recognizing our responsibilities as industrialists we will devote ourselves to the progress and development of society and the well being of people through our business activities thereby enhancing the quality of life throughout the world

5588393 we hadden het niet beter kunnen doen dan dat we tot nu toe hebben gedaan
5588394 dit was stap n ik heb geen moment getwijfeld over het bereiken van de halve finales
5588395 het is heel simpel om een opdracht mee te geven maar het ook daadwerkelijk uitvoeren is iets moeilijker
5588396 maar dat komt ook doordat je door die ochtendwedstrijd uit je ritme wordt gehaald
5588397 in het laatste deel hebben we het baltempo omhoog gedaan en toen ging het beter
5588398 het is een presidentsvrouwe uit een oorlogsgebied dat brengt extra beveiligingsmaatregelen met zich mee we geven liever geen politieke lading aan de uitvaart

5588401 in amper tien jaar tijd is het totale winkeloppervlak in nederland met tien miljoen vierkante meter gegroeid tot 26 miljoen vierkante meter dat is veel te veel
5588402 vaak ontwikkelen die nieuwe projecten zonder overleg met de detailhandel en zonder rekening te houden met het bestaande winkeloppervlak
5588403 dit verhaal bewijst weer eens dat de raad nederlandse detailhandel niet verder kijkt dan de grote steden waar de middenstand inderdaad met problemen kampt maar in regios als west brabant gaat het goed daar zou de rnd eens moeten gaan kijken
5588404 als we dat maar vaak genoeg blijven roepen dan gaan we er vanzelf wel in geloven maar feit is dat de consument nog steeds bereid is geld uit te geven ik zie de mensen toch zelf nog steeds met volle tassen de winkels uitkomen
5588405 john mccains character courage record and life experience make him the best candidate of either party to meet todays challenges senator john mccain has a long standing pro life record whats more he has the ability to secure the republican nomination and to prevail against any democrat nominee each of which is strongly pro abortion here is the way we thought about our decision it was made at the intersection of three issues defense of the unborn defense of our nation from the islamic terrorists and electability when these issues are taken into consideration together we believe there is no candidate who is better than john mccain we urge all pro lifers to consider john mccain in precisely this way
5588406 right now mccain is skating on the thinnest of ice at best the election is tied in many polls he is 4 5 points down he has yet to crack 45 percent in any national poll and is behind in key states at worst he is facing a blowout now is not the time to pussyfoot around with a guy like tom ridge mccain is already suspect among social conservatives and picking a pro choicer will have the further effect of cooling whatever ardor he has been able to gin up among them mostly because of the fear of obama social conservatives are largely not for mccain they are against obama a lack of enthusiasm among mccain supporters could spell disaster for him come election day at the moment mccain can expect at least tepid support among faithful catholics those who go to mass at least once a week and who support the teachings of the church on core issues like abortion he needs this group to win the election he is putting them in an untenable position if he decides to pick ridge

5588432 if there was a misunderstanding or you didnt like my son you didnt have to hurt him or kill him like that
5588433 its senseless because youre mad at me or you dont like me nobody owns these streets
5588434 whatever it takes to save the young people we need to do that
5588435 anytime you suppress research it goes through the research community like wildfire we can all feel like the man is coming down on us as security researchers

5588437 after 24 years in the air force i retired returned to california and began teaching 8th grade math in the public school system retiring from that in 1999
5588438 in 1998 thirty years after my last rescue my second son craig who was by then an army helicopter pilot stationed in korea found an internet listing searching for me with the connivance of my wife he furnished my contact information to the requesters
5588439 so it was that on a sunday afternoon i received a call inquiring if i was jolly 09
5588440 i jumped at the chance and my wife and i traveled to nellis it was there that i met under much more desirable circumstances many of the folks who had flown on my final mission one of them was the survivor i had picked up we began an on again off again correspondence via email
5588441 having gotten the ball rolling so to speak craig began pestering me to write down all those stories he and his brother had heard so many years earlier i however was reluctant to do this as it sounded like a lot of work so the project just faded away
5588442 a year later i retired from my teaching job and my wife and i moved to kansas where craig and his family with at the time our only grandchildren resided craig began pestering me anew about writing a book but i wasnt interested
5588443 then i received an email from the survivor of that last rescue in it he jotted down the essentials of what had occurred at least from his point of view intrigued i wrote a counterpoint and found the task to be enjoyable
5588444 i decided to attempt a written record of those events from so long ago
5588445 we decided to produce our efforts on standard typing paper bound with a comb format
5588446 in january of 2003 we printed 10 copies under the title an old helicopter pilot remembers vietnam on a laser printer and distributed them between the boys and myself it had been fun but i was glad it was over this was the
5588447 once again i retired from the book business or at least i thought i had it wasnt long before david came up with the idea of having an actual book printed and began bugging me to do just that
5588448 as always i was reluctant i had heard horror stories about rejection notices and the general inability to get a private venture published david countered these objections by locating several pod publish on demand companies
5588449 they offered exactly what i wanted a no cost upfront quality product with no minimum number of books required they also provided a free sales website www vietnam air rescues com which i had developed after relying heavily on both david and son 4 mark
5588450 thats a fair question which i think i alluded to earlier initially i was a rather reluctant author not because it bothered me to write about my experiences in vietnam but i simply did not think anyone would be very interested in hearing my stories i give full credit to my 2nd son craig who got the thing started and to my other 3 sons david eric and mark who quietly encouraged pushed their dad to keep on with the project
5588451 basically my focus was still on the book being for the benefit of my sons i was not sure how to approach a traditional publisher nor did i want to be smothered by an outside force
5588452 as i mentioned earlier i was very reluctant to get involved in the marketing process createspace offered what was to me the perfect solution so called vanity publishers have been around for years and they and those authors they publish have had a certain stigma in some circles
5588453 i was intrigued at the thought of having a book actually published but at the same time i was not interested in investing large sums of money and having a few thousand copies lying around that i could not get rid of with their no cost process and their ties to amazon as an outlet createspace seemed a perfect fit they have met and surpassed all my expectations
5588454 no perhaps because i did not involve either dod or the air force in any of this i have tried to be very careful not to discuss any situations that might still be classified the things i mention are all now a part of the public record
5588455 very positive on my website www vietnam air rescues com i have reproduced some of the written comments i have received from people in all walks of life
5588456 did i feel vulnerable oh yes but normally nothing happened we had 4 sets of double bunk beds so some would nap but that gets old after awhile others would play cards or talk i did a lot of reading basically we just endured
5588457 i remember one pj blurting out one day that he wished someone would get shot down so we would have something to do he was roundly criticized for that but he meant no harm just wished for something anything to do
5588458 we had our one canteen apiece of water which could be refilled from a canister in the helicopter due to the hot weather and high humidity it was important to drink a lot of water but drinking tepid bordering on hot water is not a pleasant experience
5588459 our food consisted of whatever we personally purchased and carried
5588460 bathroom facilities were non existent you just carried your m 16 or pistol and walked out in the brush a ways and did your thing
5588461 yes in retrospect it does seem odd and yes the tribesmen were effective we were still in laos however and off the beaten track there was nothing of any value around us for miles and therefore we were apparently of little interest to the enemy the unofficial war in laos appeared to be centered around the pdj and vientiane the capitol i do not know of any jolly green personnel who were ground causalities at the sites apparently the tribesmen were a sufficient deterrent during the daylight hours
5588462 fortunately i never had the occasion to use one nor do i know of anyone else who did
5588463 in essence anything is possible however common sense would indicate that an enemy who was close enough to aim a beam of light into my eyes was also close enough to just shoot me the enemy had obviously absolutely no advance notice of when or where an american aircraft would be shot down attempting to deploy or even use on an ad hoc basis such a device does not seem reasonable occams razor seems to apply here the simplest most obvious answer is most likely the correct one
5588464 we were a very small tight knit unit this man was apparently frustrated because he had to play 2nd banana as a co pilot due to his lack of helicopter experience i say this although i have the suspicion he would have acted as he did anyway
5588465 he was able to inflict himself on the squadron because in my opinion we had a very weak squadron commander if you were willing to kiss up he basically would leave you alone although he liked to have his cheerleaders
5588466 i was never openly disrespectful to him but did adamantly refuse to play along with his games i found it was best for me to just avoid him where possible which was not easy to do in such a small unit strangely enough he never openly confronted me just used others to harass me
5588467 since i was unwilling to succumb to his games i found the best way was to avoid dealing with him directly that is i attempted to use others as a go between where possible no matter how much i tried to avoid him i was always on his s list so to speak and suffered from that in many ways
5588468 a case in point the policy was that if you arrived as a co pilot you stayed a co pilot we were fighting a war and did not have an upgrade program the ops officer however insisted that an upgrade program be implemented solely for him and used alert helos in thailand to gain flying time of course he had to fly with an ip instructor pilot on one flight he mishandled the controls and caused a crash no one was injured but a helicopter was lost the ops officer mounted an aggressive campaign against the ip who was subsequently sent home in disgrace even though the fault clearly lay with the ops officer after that people were reluctant to chance their careers by resisting him this left me highly visible and basically alone in opposing him
5588469 no i was not there on a medal hunt i just wanted to do all i could to save american lives i felt extremely fortunate to be able to perform a few rescues there were several other pilots who pulled the same alerts i did yet never participated in a single rescue during their one year term
5588470 technically i was in the wrong on that rescue i had elected to pursue a course of action that while potentially laudable was not part of my mission profile
5588471 my advice perform your mission while following your heart dont leave yourself vulnerable to the sunday morning quarterbacks although i occasionally stretched my orders or operating procedures i was careful to follow military procedures i would do all that was in my power to complete the mission yet i would also refuse to perform morally questionable acts
5588472 i am not attempting to hint at anything beyond what i saw there is not much else to tell i took my pictures and made my observations what was portable was quickly whisked away we did not remain overnight at the forward site when i returned the biplane and all traces of the incident were gone i never heard it mentioned again
5588473 no my role was to rescue downed american pilots although it was both fun and exciting to get to see first hand some of the other side of the war it was not really relevant to my mission i firmly believed we were fighting for the right cause and found it interesting to see how low tech methods were implemented
5588474 we were using their then secret bases this necessitated a certain level of interaction since we also stayed in their living huts when at the overnight site i do not have any idea why they chose to deal with me individually other than the fact i could keep my mouth shut
5588475 no i was not really in the loop regarding cia activities what was going on in laos was an open secret amazingly correspondents who knew the score would ask us in jest where we had been when we returned they know full well what we were doing but to my knowledge never publicized any of the details
5588476 the united states government asked the fighter pilots to fly against the worlds top air defense system provided by the soviets and operate under ridiculously restrictive rules of engagement
5588477 we did not measure the cost of any mission by the amount of fuel consumed or the hours flown
5588478 i personally know of several helicopter pilots who decided the risk was too great and pulled the plug on a mission
5588479 now decades later one might question whether we were right in continuing that particular mission my only response is ask the survivor
5588480 i did not attend west point but have always admired their motto of duty honor country

5588485 on these considerations a case could be made for an early reduction in the cash rate
5588486 hogans legal arguments are unsupported by case authority and without merit
5588487 first hogan is wrong because the summonses do not seek tax returns
5588488 i think we might be fifth or sixth in the gold
5588489 i expect we should be able to come fifth in the overall
5588490 we said 42 to 48 medals i think its going to be between 40 and 42 we may not be top five in the gold i think we will be top five in the overall
5588491 we didnt know coming into these games how much china in particular was going to take from the top six or seven nations and its clear theyve taken medals from us

5588498 we dont live in times when labeling and humiliating others is funny
5588499 the story brings to mind the love hate relationship that the united states has had with migrant workers from mexico the article highlights how in 1919 texas brought in tens of thousands of mexican migrants to pick its cotton each year then it invited them all to leave

5588502 sen obama made it clear that he was really going to get into the nuts and bolts of the kinds of questions oregonians are talking about and i think it has served him well in our state
5588503 im confident that once sen obama gets as well known in these larger states as he has in oregon he is going to see the same success elswhere

5588509 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
5588510 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
5588511 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
5588512 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
5588513 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
5588514 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
5588515 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
5588516 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
5588517 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
5588518 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
5588519 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
5588520 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
5588521 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
5588522 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
5588523 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
5588524 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
5588525 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
5588526 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
5588527 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
5588528 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
5588529 just so you all know we did set a record
5588530 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
5588531 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
5588532 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
5588533 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
5588534 we the citizens of the united states of america have the ultimate responsibility to elect the
5588535 20 wind by 2030 increasing wind energy contribution to u s electric supply
5588536 would be accomplished solely through private investment with no new customer or corporate taxes or government regulation
5588537 in 1999 2001 and 2003 when congress temporarily killed the credits the number of new turbines dropped dramatically
5588538 tuesdays event illustrates the inherent challenges associated with using wind energy because the wind sometimes stops blowing without a moments notice engineers at ercot must remain nimble enough to respond to resulting instability on the grid
5588539 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
5588540 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
5588541 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
5588542 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
5588543 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
5588544 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
5588545 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
5588546 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
5588547 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure
5588548 hang on one goldurned minute this aint gold at all its just gold coloured
5588549 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
5588550 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
5588551 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
5588552 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
5588553 barack obama is going to have to win this thing or lose this thing on his own
5588554 we analysts have had to pretend to know what they are thinking
5588555 and so weve had to get by without really knowing what were talking about
5588556 who would have thought last year that me and t boone pickens would be in the same boat pulling the same oar the same way
5588557 when you go to the gas pump you dont check whether you are a democrat or republican
5588558 now dependent on foreign nations for 70 percent of its oil the u s is exporting 700 billion annually more than four times the cost of the iraq war
5588559 there are people standing by with billions ready to invest in the future sun wind geothermal biomass
5588560 we cant drill our way of this situation but we will do everything we can to produce more domestic energy just two years ago i pushed for 8 3 million acres of drill sites in the gulf of mexico now that is done
5588561 any credible domestic energy policy must reduce our dependence on foreign oil by at least 30 percent in the next 10 years
5588562 he understands the issues and is interested and excited by the work we are doing to educate and involve the people
5588563 importing 70 percent of our oil now thats an issue of security its going to take us 10 years to reduce our dependency by 30 percent
5588564 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5588565 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5588566 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5588567 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5588568 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
5588569 and threatened to cut the supply of oil via the gas pipeline
5588570 russland setzt momentan leider das werkzeug ein das es schon immer eingesetzt hat wenn es eine botschaft klarmachen will und das ist seine milit rische macht
5588571 ich glaube jeder erkennt dass wir dieses problem nicht zum ersten mal erleben
5588572 ich hoffe die welt wacht auf und sieht was passiert
5588573 das schlimmste was die welt tun k nnte w re es kompromisse einzugehen und schw che zu zeigen
5588574 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
5588575 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
5588576 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
5588577 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
5588578 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
5588579 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
5588580 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
5588581 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
5588582 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
5588583 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
5588584 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
5588585 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
5588586 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
5588587 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
5588588 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
5588589 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
5588590 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
5588591 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery

5588593 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5588594 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5588595 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5588596 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5588597 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5588598 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5588599 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5588600 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5588601 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5588602 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5588603 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5588604 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5588605 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5588606 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5588607 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5588608 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5588609 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5588610 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5588611 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5588612 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
5588613 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5588614 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5588615 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5588616 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5588617 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5588618 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5588619 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5588620 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5588621 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5588622 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5588623 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
5588624 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
5588625 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
5588626 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source
5588627 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
5588628 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
5588629 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
5588630 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
5588631 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night

5588635 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
5588636 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
5588637 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
5588638 they were all our first choices everyone said yes which is so rare
5588639 our motto has been get the story right get the facts right tell it honestly
5588640 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
5588641 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
5588642 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
5588643 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
5588644 10 6 gw the generation capacity of the six plants x 7884 hours of generation per year assuming 90 operational 83 57 twh y 83 57 twh y x 0 65 54 mt co2 y
5588645 this is the moment when we must defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it
5588646 i dont think theres anything more unseemly than the sight of a rock star in academic robes its a bit like when people put their king charles spaniels in little tartan sweats and hats its not natural and it doesnt make the dog any smarter
5588647 what happens is the water tunnels to the bottom and makes the ice like swiss cheese sort of like termites
5588648 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
5588649 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
5588650 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
5588651 the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming
5588652 obama mccain discussion with megachurch minister warren has auburn producer director
5588653 a full portfolio of resources can ease the energy crunch
5588654 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
5588655 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
5588656 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
5588657 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
5588658 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
5588659 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
5588660 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
5588661 it may be biased to view the deal as going against nuclear non proliferation efforts
5588662 one can live in the shadow of an idea without grasping it
5588663 the issue of judges is likely to be resolved today
5588664 any decision about musharrafs accountability will be taken by the leaders of the coalition parties

5588666 im pokal gelten andere gesetze das bewahrheitet sich immer wieder wir werden empfingen auf keinen fall untersch tzen gehen aber mit viel selbstvertrauen ins spiel
5588667 over time wall street firms began to trade against their clients for their own account such that now the direct investment activities of a firm like goldman sachs dwarf their activities on behalf of outside customers
5588668 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
5588669 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
5588670 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
5588671 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
5588672 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
5588673 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
5588674 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
5588675 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
5588676 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
5588677 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
5588678 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
5588679 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
5588680 mijn cli nt had een verzoek tot beperkte detentie ingediend en werd op 7 augustus opgeroepen om te verschijnen voor de brusselse strafuitvoeringsrechtbank die zetelde in de gevangenis van leuven centraal
5588681 op 12 augustus werd zijn verzoek ingewilligd beperkte detentie houdt in dat mijn cli nt overdag de gevangenis mag verlaten om te gaan werken aan die detentie is ook een aantal strenge voorwaarden verbonden zo moet mijn cli nt de burgerlijke partijen blijven afbetalen mag hij geen contact onderhouden met de mededaders en mag hij niet meer actief zijn in de brede sector van de vleeshandel
5588682 het is een bewuste keuze van mijn cli nt om zich stap voor stap in de maatschappij te re ntegreren
5588683 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
5588684 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
5588685 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
5588686 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5588687 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5588688 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5588689 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5588690 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5588691 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
5588692 many in the christian right tend to get their information
5588693 and if no one is listening then it is because they dont want to hear because this is a referendum people dont need anyone to represent them they are representing themselves as somebody who has followed peoples movements and who has been in rallies and at the heart or the edge of things i dont think you can dispute what you see here
5588694 since the 1930s there have been debates and disputes about who has the right to represent the kashmiri people whether it was hari singh or sheikh abdullah or someone else and the debate continues till today whether it is the hurriyat or some other party
5588695 and captains of work must always be but there is a wide difference between being captains of work and taking the profits of it
5588696 even a great mistake a lifelong mistake and perhaps as long as eternity too
5588697 so are you saying that were all just like really excellent sheep
5588698 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
5588699 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
5588700 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
5588701 id be remiss if i didnt say hello buddy cianci mayor of providence
5588702 i want you to know i was wearing my rhode island democrats t shirt when i was exercising this morning put that in the paper
5588703 i get amused when i see that stern faced young man from colorado extolling the merits of assault weapons
5588704 i didnt see any donkeys although we heard a weird sound when we first got in here
5588705 they must have you know seen me coming but they all hid somewhere
5588706 i dont care if you have jesus christ in the van
5588707 no i know if i needed to get out id make my way out just as i made my way in you have to see the possibilities
5588708 if my opponent had been there at the moon launch it would have been called a risky rocket scheme
5588709 if hed been there when edison was testing the light bulb it would have been a risky anti candle scheme
5588710 and if hed been there when the internet was invented
5588711 there was a ramp that went over the rubble my son brendan and i were able to come here and all the world stops when we had whole bodies or something that would resemble a whole body and people would line up on each side of this makeshift ramp and i went down with my son brendan and we were able to collect jonathan he was already in a basket and ive got to stop for a second so we were able to go down spend a little time and then brendan and myself and some of the guys in jons company we carried him up put him in an ambulance and took jon away we were blessed in a way because my son was a whole body
5588712 in the early 1970s i had a disastrous grand prix and she said dont worry
5588713 it has been a very difficult year i spent two thirds of my life with her
5588714 she was such a strategist behind everything jonathon and amy stepped up to the plate everyone picked up the load and thats the way it had to be
5588715 if you persevere long enough if you do the right things long enough good things will happen
5588716 when i found mac cones horse couldnt go i told torchy millar the canadian equestrian teams technical coach if a bookmaker was taking odds hed say the canadian team wouldnt have a shot at a medal
5588717 collectively you guys are the best top 5 weve ever had
5588718 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
5588719 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
5588720 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
5588721 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
5588722 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
5588723 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
5588724 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
5588725 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
5588726 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
5588727 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
5588728 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
5588729 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
5588730 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
5588731 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
5588732 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
5588733 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
5588734 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
5588735 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
5588736 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
5588737 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
5588738 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
5588739 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
5588740 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
5588741 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
5588742 the squad we had last season is good enough carlos tevez will be back for the portsmouth game next week anderson is due back from the olympics by the time we play liverpool and chelsea and wayne rooney will be more effective for playing 90 minutes against newcastle
5588743 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
5588744 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
5588745 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
5588746 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
5588747 the film changed my life and my way of thinking i decided to do whatever i could
5588748 when i learned of their problem i decided to do something at least help them dig wells in their area which would provide a perennial source of water
5588749 when she expressed a desire to help people in rural maharashtra we decided to encourage her
5588750 she always had an inclination toward social service and we decided to cultivate it
5588751 the drive began in july and by the end of the month a total of 2600 was collected this money was sufficient to dig a bore well as well as fit an electric pump
5588752 i want to build rural maharashtra i want medical attention to be available to everyone and make physicians available in every village in rural maharashtra
5588753 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
5588754 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
5588755 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
5588756 selectarea cazurilor care au beneficiat de donatii a fost extrem de dificila insa cu suportul federatiei romane de diabet reprezentata de prof dr nicolae hancu presedintele acestei organizatii precum si a reprezentantilor locali prof dr mariana graur seful clinicii de diabet din iasi dr gabriela creteanu seful sectiei de diabet din suceava si dr oleniuc adriana radauti am reusit sa aducem un plus de liniste si siguranta unor oameni care au nevoie de acest lucru acum mai mult ca oricand in calitate de lider mondial in tratamentul diabetului novo nordisk isi propune ca pe viitor sa isi asume si alte actiuni de responsabilitate sociala destinate pacientilor care sufera de diabet
5588757 i think you just have to keep doing the same kinds of things youve been doing
5588758 you cant try to make it bigger than it is its a good opportunity and hopefully i can perform well and we can perform well as a team i dont think you can try to make it more than it is
5588759 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
5588760 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
5588761 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
5588762 wir sind dem gegner nur hinterhergelaufen ich glaube viele haben noch nicht kapiert dass wir auf platz zwanzig stehen und da auch noch eine weile stehen werden
5588763 nach drei spielen gibt es bei uns noch keine trainerdiskussion
5588764 ich kann nur versprechen dass dann eine mannschaft auf dem platz stehen wird die gras frisst
5588765 das war eine verdiente niederlage wir sind dem gegner immer nur hinterhergelaufen
5588766 einige spieler haben immer noch nicht begriffen dass wir auf platz 20 stehen
5588767 wir kassieren ein tor und dann ist gleich wieder alles aus
5588768 die durchschlagskraft um gegen eine elf wie unterhaching zu bestehen hatten wir nicht
5588769 wir hatten chancen im minutentakt und h tten heute sehr sehr hoch gewinnen k nnen
5588770 ich verspreche dass gegen sandhausen eine mannschaft auf dem platz stehen wird die gras fressen wird und keinen weg scheut
5588771 hes earned it with his consistent play and he has the best mastery of the offense at this point
5588772 if you wanted to attack the u s bring us to our knees you wouldnt even have to come here
5588773 the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
5588774 we send it to a few friends and we send it to the people who dont like us very well
5588775 and im convinced were paying for both sides of the war

5588782 i just had nothing there i came here looking for a medal i prepared as hard as i could and gave everything today but i came 12th hopefully another four years maturity will help me gain an extra 12 places
5588783 my training went really well and im in the best ever shape but i didnt do myself justice
5588784 i was too far down on my swim which meant i had to use up too much energy catching up on the bike the others had their legs on their run but i didnt
5588785 cnn contacted me about this whole thing theyre doing for the election trying to encourage people to vote and they told us they were approaching chris for the project
5588786 im a big fan of his hes got a great voice and i thought it would be a really good idea so i just gave my blessing to the project and they took it from there
5588787 i think people have come to realize what a big mistake the last time theyd voted was it might have been anyway there are two very viable candidates as far as im concerned and there is one who will be a revolutionary candidate in a way and change the direction of america and i think the more people that get out there to vote thats extremely important
5588788 its a song that requires a really strong voice to carry it off and hes got the range and the power to really do it convincingly
5588789 i dont think there are that many singers around at the moment that could really nail it out of all the singers of that style hes the strongest hes just a great singer all around it doesnt matter what style it is he could pretty much sing anything
5588790 i think its not too far away from the original
5588791 theyve modernized it a bit brought it up to todays standards with the sound and arrangement too when i heard it it made me think back to when we recorded the original it was pretty exciting at the time and i sort of got the same feeling when i heard chris version
5588792 you know yall were like let me get four tickets to the funeral hes still the hottest ticket in town
5588793 bernie always said that he walked alone i dont think that he was alone i think he was walking with jesus ill see you soon bernie

5588797 anggaran pendidikan telah meningkat hampir dua kali lipat dari rp 78 5 triliun pada tahun 2005 menjadi rp 154 2 triliun pada tahun 2008
5588798 five years ago when we were first starting out wed autograph shirts and say start your own band about books
5588799 we just wanted to present a different idea of what a band could be
5588800 we wanted to play music that you wouldnt normally see on the tv or the radio
5588801 we werent thinking we would create a wizard rock movement it just evolved
5588802 but its cool to see bands about books realized in some way
5588803 some people dont like twilight potentially becoming the new harry potter theres a lot of groaning and moaning about the movie coming out and the fact that there is twilight music kind of bothers some people
5588804 twilight is sort of like the hannah montana of literature
5588805 if youre outside the 14 to 16 year old age range you might listen to it and it might get stuck in your head but its not good literature its not really enriching your life the way harry potter might
5588806 love is never going to get old and if you can find new ways to talk about love you can find new ways to write about twilight but i dont think twilight is as powerful as harry potter is twilight is about love and being a teenager and wondering if you fit in and harry potter is that and so much more
5588807 for us its a community not so much a genre of music and i dont know if they have a community yet if they all get together if the bands are as close as all of us are
5588808 i dont think it could have a movement on its own
5588809 but wizard rock can expand to be bands themed about other books it doesnt just have to be about harry potter anyone who is singing about any book can be part of wizard rock
5588810 illegal file sharing is a very serious issue resulting in millions of pounds of losses to copyright owners

5588813 there is no doubt that revenue from us visitors over the past year will have been lower than would have been the case if sterling had remained at the 1 80 mark
5588814 but we will need sterling to remain at its new cheaper level for some months before we start to recoup these losses
5588815 london is a hub you see where many americans go on to fly to europe
5588816 for once its not terrorism which is stopping the americans from travelling its the pound but also the elections they never travel during the elections
5588817 its not a matter of what is true that counts but a matter of what is perceived to be true
5588818 the company has taken this measure as an additional safeguard to reassure its business customers and the public as to the safety of its products dawn farm foods has engaged the services of a specialist bio activation technology company normally utilised in the pharmaceutical and biomedical sectors to carry out this process
5588819 this is the first incident of its kind for dawn farm foods in its 25 years in operation and dawn farms is working closely with the authorities and international experts to ensure that every necessary step is taken and all efforts are made to protect consumer health and maintain customer confidence

5588834 this is the first study that shows the contribution of ships to fine particulates in the atmosphere
5588835 ships are really unregulated when it comes to air pollution standards what we wanted to find out was the contribution of ships to the air pollution in san diego and what we found was a surprise because no one expected that the contribution from ships of solid sulfur rich particles called primary sulfate would be so high
5588836 but our results suggest that this component of ship emissions is important and should not be ignored in the future knowing how much sulfate from ships is in the air will also allow us to better understand what happens to the other 93 percent of sulfur emitted by ships
5588837 wont commit to a tour schedule to promote the album

5588894 nobody is going to beat them no way its just not going to happen
5588895 we feel like were playing very well right now but you have to keep in mind its single elimination
5588896 just have them thinking beyond high school what they want to do with their lives just present a positive alternative to being in a gang or doing any other negative things
5588897 you know a lot of kids get a bad wrap for being bad or mischievous when really they just need a positive role model in their life

5588899 this shows that taking direct steps against infringers is an important and effective weapon in the battle against online piracy
5588900 it was always intended that there would be a lot more
5588901 the previous ones were default judgements where defendants never turned up
5588902 i do not get any sense that theres been any fundamental shift in the desire to litigate
5588903 an open court process with a full report is certainly preferable to justice of the type being mooted by the government on p2p where activity takes place behind closed doors through industry action
5588904 we still have to ask them if they are willing since it may contain sensitive or proprietary information
5588905 i think everyone recognizes the need for urgent care in pasadena and there are very few options available
5588906 the health department conducted a strategic planning process a couple of years ago throughout pasadena interviewing 1 000 individuals residents nonprofits and health care providers and access to health care and urgent care was one of the top priorities
5588907 but a lot of variables go into that becoming a reality
5588908 the developers have yet to submit an application and i have no idea what they are experiencing in todays financing market
5588909 its understandable people want to see it preserved as a health care entity
5588910 but we havent done any formal assessments we would really need to speak to the developer and still a lot of evaluation and analysis would have to go forward if were looking at a viable option
5588911 some people think its the same as an er open 24 hours seven days a week

5588914 there is no doubt that revenue from us visitors over the past year will have been lower than would have been the case if sterling had remained at the 1 80 mark
5588915 but we will need sterling to remain at its new cheaper level for some months before we start to recoup these losses
5588916 london is a hub you see where many americans go on to fly to europe
5588917 if maternity leave were an olympic event not only would we miss out on reaching the medals podium we would never have qualified to compete in the first place
5588918 a six to 12 month paid maternity leave scheme is not a radical proposition when you consider sweden the uk denmark and canada are already at this level or above and we believe this should be the starting point for discussion
5588919 i was a little bit embarrassed with the amount of attention that he got after that game because he was so good and the fact he did a lot of it against me was a little bit embarrassing
5588920 but i think a lot of players in the league had the same situation i had during that night during the year
5588921 you feel a bit helpless at times because hes that good a player if i get him ill be trying my best to shut him down and hope my teammates can give me a bit of help
5588922 hes such a strong player that he gives a fend off when you go to tackle him hes very strong through the hips as well you cant really get him to ground rawlings said
5588923 im not too sure how were going to go about it last time it didnt work too well
5588924 theyve got so many good players you cant just focus on him
5588925 if you fall into that trap youre in a bit of trouble
5588926 dean laidley is coaching really well and were following instructions weve had a really good two months of footy
5588927 but were playing against a team thats pretty much undefeated for the last 18 months
5588928 well have a crack on their home turf we won there last year but to say were going to go down and beat them is a pretty big ask
5588929 the club has been fantastic for me not only with my footy but off the field as well with some issues they have really helped me out so i want to pay them back
5588930 the playing group is fantastic and a huge reason why i signed up
5588931 to come to a decision like that weve taken a lot of things into consideration last year how orton finished the season training camp preseason games
5588932 in the end it comes down to a gut feeling that you have
5588933 excused from such performance from and after july 4 2008 pursuant to california labor code sec 2855 a
5588934 may not be enforced against the employee beyond seven years from the commencement of service under it
5588935 emis relationship with 30 seconds to mars has been extremely rewarding and successful for both the band and the company
5588936 the hard work of emis global team and of the band has resulted in sales of 3 million albums and singles multiple awards and a growing global fanbase however we have been forced to take procedural legal steps in order to protect emis investment and rights during contract renegotiations initiated by the band and management we hope to resolve these matters amicably and put them behind us so we can continue working in partnership with the band to take them to even greater levels of success
5588937 we had been signed to our record contract for nine years
5588938 basically under california law where we live and signed our deal one cannot be bound to a contract for more than seven years this is widely known by all the record companies and has been for years in fact so aware of it are they that they desperately try to make deals outside of california whenever possible it is a law that protects people from lengthy unfair career spanning contracts this law also gave us the legal right to explore other possible opportunities
5588939 we have been sued by the corporation quite simply because roughly 45 days ago we exercised our legal right to terminate our old out of date contract which according to the law is null and void
5588940 we terminated for a number of reasons which we wont go into here
5588941 the next record we make will be used to pay off that old supposed debt
5588942 so we have lost many of the people that were near and dear to us at virgin emi and crucial to the success of 30 seconds to mars a few of the great ones are still there but it is hardly the same company we have known
5588943 im very confident that there are losses from doing this to the whole economy
5588944 theyre small losses but it just amazes me that we are sleep walking our way into a mistake
5588945 this is doing something that will do quite a lot of harm to the industry
5588946 noise was deemed by our noise control officer to be excessive
5588947 the noise control officer asked the kindergarten to turn the music down not off entirely
5588948 the afghan national army is saying that anytime we get close to them they detonate themselves

5588951 according to our reports about 30 taliban tried to attack the salerno base they were fired at we have found six bodies which were all wearing suicide vests
5588952 some of them have blown themselves up others are hiding in nearby houses and corn fields the troops are searching for them
5588953 weve said theres a high likelihood of industrial action later this week or next week
5588954 were not 100 per cent sure yet on what were going to do but it definitely will be something we dont want to signal to the department what were going to do yet
5588955 wed like the industrial relations commission to direct the department to negotiate on all aspects of what theyve actually put on the table yesterday
5588956 our managers will stay online and police will come to the outer perimeter of the jails and deal with anything that it has to protect the community like escorts
5588957 weve come up with a process of letting them prisoners out and exercising every day showers and they will get all their medical care and be fed of course
5588958 they may well have some type of contingency plan but if we were to go on strike there would be disruption
5588959 we the peoples alliance for democracy feel that thaksin and his wife should return to thailand to face the charges being brought against them
5588960 should they seek political asylum any democratic country should not allow them to ignore the law of thailand
5588961 we know youre dying to show off your single speed bike with gold handlebars
5588962 all along we said that the model was dependent on getting their titles for distribution for christmas this year
5588963 we could get frustrated but the wheels come off when you start to argue
5588964 theres no point you stop and figure it out you talk about it instead of turning your back on your teammate
5588965 we came out flat against belgium and we learned a lot from that
5588966 its important to have a fast start and we did that we played the best team weve played so far and we played steady
5588967 im going to name my bar after the 32 counties of ireland and play flogging molly 24 7 so people think i really am irish and not irish american

5589003 i know im going to have to find a new route into town
5589004 its hard enough to get a customer in the door without having them escorted by the cia or someone else
5589005 were going to get a lot of visibility from people coming into this area i dont think it will hurt
5589006 we have been working two shifts a day and are ahead of schedule

5589013 religionsl rere kan g re deres undervisning endnu mere sp ndende ved at f en opl gsholder ud p skolerne og pr sentere ateisme og det synspunkt at der ikke findes guder og s kan man tage en debat med eleverne bagefter
5589014 ateismen er et helt legitimt emne i skolens religionsundervisning det er ikke pligtigt men man kan lige s vel arbejde med ateisme som livsopfattelse som man kan arbejde med buddhisme satanisme eller hvad det nu kunne v re
5589015 weve wracked our brains to think of some kind of captive approach we can do by taking it in and rearing it ourselves but it seems to be impossible in australia and possibly around the world
5589016 its just heartbreaking the only thing we can do is monitor the little fella and hope he finds a new mum
5589017 she ms goreng goreng told me i was a young white person i shouldnt be here and it wasnt my country
5589018 i was a little bit embarrassed with the amount of attention that he got after that game because he was so good and the fact he did a lot of it against me was a little bit embarrassing

5589032 the drinks industry creates in excess of 60 000 full time jobs
5589033 and generates two billion euros au4 billion in revenue annually irish drink exports are worth 1 3 billion euros which is more than dairy exports at 1 2 billion
5589034 pubs are good for social cohesion people meet in pubs gather and form a sense of community
5589035 unless public transport was improved dramatically we will never go back to the good old days of the pub
5589036 when people are short of money they tend to entertain at home unless there is a dramatic improvement in public transport this wont change
5589037 i think if youre going to talk about an issue you need to know what youre talking about
5589038 i think at this point everything needs to be on the table
5589039 the bottom line is he doesnt work well with others he doesnt play well with others
5589040 although people have been charged there is still a lot of work to do and other lines of inquiry that need to be followed up
5589041 the investigators have made a significant stride and hopefully this dreadful case is coming to its conclusion
5589042 all i will say is that my client maintains his innocence
5589043 we were informed this morning of the news from antigua and we are pleased at how the investigation is progressing
5589044 thank you for calling dan your estimated wait time is 5 minutes 30 seconds
5589045 im in the final but right now im still a bit mad with myself
5589046 when have i ever had an easy ride never once i just accept that im never going to have an easy ride ill be fine
5589047 i believed i could do it on the first jump but then you start having the doubts and then you kind of panic and go through every single emotion you can possibly think of
5589048 all it comes down to is trusting what youve been doing every single day in training thats what my coach told me and i just had to believe in myself and trust it and then take a big breath slow everything down and then i got it
5589049 thats job done im pleased ive got the feel for the track and im looking forward to the final
5589050 im just looking to perform to the best of my ability so i can walk off the track like i have done today and be satisfied with what ive done
5589051 i think 64 or 65 metres could make a medal and im capable of that so im looking to throw as far as i possibly can and if i can walk away with a medal ill be ecstatic
5589052 im pleased to get the first one over with it was nerve racking because ive not run for a while but im happy enough
5589053 he was indias best bet in pakistan we will miss musharraf
5589054 if he had not fired his judges and gotten bogged down in domestic dramas i believe we would have been able to make a significant breakthrough in a peace deal in kashmir today
5589055 we have no comments to make on the resignation of president musharraf of pakistan
5589056 still musharraf was a one man go to guy in pakistan now who do we speak to these are very uncertain times
5589057 we are very close to deciding to send the prime minister for the closing ceremony of the olympics to be participated by many foreign dignitaries
5589058 its because of that experience that when i hear women are being treated unfairly in the workplace where theres injustice and theres not the basic principle of equal pay for equal work i get mad i get frustrated
5589059 in the term of the next president skillful handling of such a crisis could be the difference between temporary hardship and far reaching disaster
5589060 many of you served in places that once seemed remote and obscure and the veterans of foreign wars know better than anyone how inattention to small crises can invite much larger ones
5589061 sen obama still cannot quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment
5589062 as they have said to me on my trips to iraq let us win just let us win
5589063 we need a commander in chief who is ready to lead not one in training
5589064 im sorry but obama doesnt have the background to run the military
5589065 fundamentally different world view of who government should fight for
5589066 my daughters i dont want them to ever confront a situation where they are disadvantaged because of their gender
5589067 i guess if youre making 3 million a year youre middle class but thats reflected in his policies
5589068 this is the first time ive really felt like i can barely make ends meet
5589069 if he made a decision to go or fight against it we didnt advise him either way
5589070 we really did keep our fingers out of this one
5589071 president musharraf has been a friend to the united states and one of the worlds most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism
5589072 we will continue to work with the pakistani government and political leaders and urge them to redouble their focus on pakistans future and its most urgent needs including stemming the growth of extremism addressing food and energy shortages and improving economic stability
5589073 the united states will help with these efforts to see pakistan reach its goal of becoming a stable prosperous democratic modern muslim nation
5589074 there is a great deal of frustration on the part of the u s government with pakistans inability to follow through on what the u s sees as its clear commitments
5589075 it remains very much to be seen whether this new democratically elected leadership will really be able to follow through in a sustained and coherent way
5589076 it could actually be setting the torch to the kindling inside the country
5589077 i dont want the people of pakistan to slide deeper and deeper into uncertainty
5589078 it puts a lot more responsibility squarely on the government there is no more excuse any more they have to stand up and do things they cant blame musharraf
5589079 i really dont think he has been a factor for six months
5589080 he hasnt been able to do that while he was in the presidency and he wont be as well positioned out of the presidency to interfere
5589081 strong pakistan that continues its efforts to strengthen democracy and fight terror
5589082 president bush looks forward to working with the government of pakistan on the economic political and security challenges they face
5589083 i think our first step should be to get the united states of america fully engaged
5589084 there is no way the first world can solve this problem alone even if the united states comes in
5589085 that is why australia coming in to the kyoto protocol is critical
5589086 i think our officials are working very closely on this to make sure there are no barriers toward linking these schemes and based on my advice there are none
5589087 an area of endeavor for us is what we do domestically on the renewable energy front
5589088 noise was deemed by our noise control officer to be excessive

5589090 the illinois coalition for immigrant and refugee rights a nonprofit advocacy group that worked with gov blagojevich to craft the executive order has played a lead role in fostering integration initiatives in other states
5589091 the governors of illinois new jersey massachusetts and washington have signed orders that make immigrant integration a priority for their states focusing on language job and citizenship training as well as access to services such as health care and public safety for immigrants
5589092 perhaps we are the only european nation to earmark merely 0 2 percent of its central budget for promoting sports and healthy ways of life the european average exceeds 1 percent
5589093 the board knows exactly the stance of the players the players have said what they had to say it is up to the board to make the decision i am sure everything is going to be looked at
5589094 its a piece of our overall strategy and one were pretty excited about
5589095 im very confident that there are losses from doing this to the whole economy

5589197 he is much better than others because he is black and black people were tyrannized in america i think he will feel our suffering
5589198 what obama said about pulling out u s forces is just for political gains it is unrealistic

5589213 its really amazing to watch them go out and teach the younger players these lessons like the role of a catalyst for example
5589214 they are just so mature and they really enjoy getting more out of being on this team than just volleyball
5589215 it is a really special group that can rely on each other from top to bottom
5589216 everyone always says that it is a team effort i know but it truly is here i have never seen anything like it
5589217 this is just such a great class their sportsmanship their leadership and their talent
5589218 we might be a newer school but the expectations here are high and we want to live up to all of them
5589219 we had been to waddo geel where we held meetings with the residents on the de mining of that road when we reached arabsiyo centre we stopped to buy something in a shop and a truck nicknamed shambo hayran passed us
5589220 we then drove after it and when we tried to overtake it the people in it turned the truck towards our car forcing our driver hassan kosar to go off the road and hit some trees along the road
5589221 finally there was a third attempt by the same truck at about 12 30pm when it got to abarso 20km west of hargeisa this time the men came out and even slapped us around we chose to downplay the incident in order to save ourselves and we drove off
5589222 as i was speaking to the man a truck drove towards us and suddenly stopped near us someone come out carrying a thick stick and tried to beat hit me on the head but i blocked it using my hand seriously injuring it then the police came and arrested the men in the truck
5589223 after they were arrested we identified them as part of a group of people who attempted to steal scrap metal from our halo trust garage in mid march 2008
5589224 if it has been a disaster then please provide the evidence
5589225 i dont understand the reasoning behind the assertion that this is dangerous for climate change
5589226 should the uk change our policy on gm to one that is more liberal
5589227 its a widespread phenomenon occurring on 20m hectares across the developing world especially in asian countries like china india and vietnam but also around nearly every city of sub saharan africa and in many latin american cities as well
5589228 nor is it limited to the countries and cities with the lowest gdp it is prevalent in many mid income countries as well
5589229 as long as developing countries lack suitable transport to deliver large quantities of perishable produce to urban areas urban agriculture will remain important in the face of water scarcity generally and a lack of access to clean water urban farmers will have no alternative except to use polluted water
5589230 many rivers in developing countries and emerging economies are now polluted to the brink of collapse for example the yangtze chinas longest river is suffering because of pollution by untreated waste agricultural run off and industrial discharge
5589231 as the world flips over from a predominantly rural to a predominantly urban population base cities are going to take more and more water for agriculture
5589232 however most of the water going into urban areas comes out the other end in the sewers
5589233 we know that there is an informal sector within many cities that is using wastewater to grow vegetables but there has been no data on how much of this water was being used or what the risks were
5589234 it is a pretty useful way of treating water in the sense that if the water just went straight into a river it would cause a lot more eutrophication problems further downstream
5589235 so in a way it is performing an ecological service by cleaning up some of the water and recycling the nutrients
5589236 if this practice is going to be increasingly commonplace and more and more people are going to be eating food produced this way then there needs to be a bit more concern about the heavy metals and other contaminants in there
5589237 ideally the end product should be treating the water to a standard that means there is no risk but most developing nations cannot afford to do this
5589238 apparently what happens now in areas with very polluted water is that the farmers do a smell test or a taste test
5589239 if the water tastes too foul or smells too bad then they wont use it to irrigate their crops but thats a pretty dangerous way to go about things
5589240 it is really just about minimising the risks from field to fork with a series of simple measures
5589241 these include letting the water settle in a pond so a lot of the eggs from worms drop out of the water and irrigating around the crops rather than on top of them
5589242 when the crop is harvested it also needs to be washed with fresh clean water in the market and that water needs to be constantly changed so everything else is not contaminated
5589243 it is troubling that there are so many countries that appear not to record the lives of those animals suffering in their laboratories
5589244 knowing the number of animals used gives real ammunition for the general public to put pressure on their governments to play their part in the global reduction and replacement of animals in experiments
5589245 the paper makes too many assumptions and extrapolations to have any confidence in its conclusion
5589246 they know the media will pick up 115 million as the top line result and not delve deeper into how they achieved this number
5589247 this year is the first time in 16 years that we have seen the number of animals used in uk labs exceed three million
5589248 the human genome project threw up many new genes but we dont know what their functions are
5589249 it is in everyones interest to replace animals in experiments wherever possible but it is difficult and that is why progress is slow
5589250 i think its part of human nature that people would want to understand things around them like some people become psychologists to understand the mind some people become biologists to understand the body physics is the understanding of almost everything that goes on around you and naturally i am attracted to such science
5589251 we had a whole lot of lectures on relativity and quantum physics
5589252 and we had some speakers come and they had special topics
5589253 it was about black holes and time distortion and stuff like that and also they talked about quantum teleportation and they told us that it was actually possible to teleport not for humans but just for photons
5589254 what i like about it is the logic and also understanding the universe because its really intriguing its something that nobody really knows about its really different from everything else you learn
5589255 the hills have been developed into plush residences and the water that flows from the hills has no natural absorbents for excessive rains which later flows into the valleys
5589256 what can i do this is the only source of water around i could possibly boil it but that is only for drinking water what about washing my dishes
5589257 our water is safe we have a state of the art water treatment plant and we are upgrading our distribution network there is no need for alarm because the water does not have bacterial contamination
5589258 the bridge is being done in two halves by design
5589259 the first half was poured in late june in order to match up the second half we want to make sure there is no vibration in the deck in order to do that we have to temporarily detour traffic
5589260 the peter pan intersection will be in front of them
5589261 we would suggest they go that way as opposed to going out the lower malpeque road because at the north end of the lower malpeque road its an unsignalized intersection and with the significant increase in traffic due to the detour it may make it very difficult to exit that intersection
5589262 in north america and western europe there was a big effort to clean up the air
5589263 part of that was a shift from coal to oil and gas and part was a move to burn coal at higher temperatures and burn it in a better way
5589264 theres been very little study of thallium in the arctic though
5589265 this is the first study that shows the contribution of ships to fine particulates in the atmosphere
5589266 ships are really unregulated when it comes to air pollution standards what we wanted to find out was the contribution of ships to the air pollution in san diego
5589267 and what we found was a surprise because no one expected that the contribution from ships of solid sulphur rich particles called primary sulphate would be so high
5589268 our results suggest that this component of ship emissions is important and should not be ignored in the future
5589269 we need to be aware that the carbon dioxide sponge represented especially by shrubs and trees may not be as big as we thought it was
5589270 this finding is yet another reason to think carefully about reducing carbon dioxide emissions
5589271 the air caused my lungs and nasal passages to burn
5589272 im measuring about a 20 to 40 percent reduction in particulate matter compared to a year ago
5589273 t he pollution and smog in beijing is much much worse than i imagined
5589274 its a bit eerie how the sun never comes out all day if you are walking around the village and you look ahead you cant see all of the buildings the pollution creates a fog that clouds over everything it is unimaginable i am shocked by how bad it is
5589275 we ran in hotter conditions than we expect to see in beijing
5589276 you sweat through your clothes in minutes and stay wet all day
5589277 i worked hard but the heat and humidity were too much for me
5589278 i always had a hard time with heat and humidity
5589279 ive had instances where i ended up in the hospital
5589280 unless i cant walk and my lungs are falling out or im coughing up a lung ill be running
5589281 beijing is one of the great cities of the world but we dont act like it sometimes
5589282 these measures have been successful the city is better now
5589283 chinese can accept hardship for the greater good especially under government guidance it is one of our national strengths
5589284 we cannot move as quickly in china as in your country but we are making progress
5589285 the delta prince edward is proud to be associated with an event like the 2009 canada games that helps inspire dreams and build champions in our canadian youth said michael bird general manager of the hotel
5589286 one of the premier properties in the province to the growing list of sponsors of the 2009 canada games
5589287 it was here last year that we turned a corner as a team when we finally got the direction we needed with the porsche this year we have had good direction and now we are pushing very hard to get our performance ready for a back to back set of races that are very different in the type of circuits and the challenges they present we are going to be testing ahead of the mosport race with some new developments that i feel the car has needed in order to give us some adjustability in our setup to remove some of the knife edge conditions that the car has had as we have got nearer to the perfect setup lets hope that the alms gets over their timing problems as it was amazing how much the lack of information upset the early part of the race at road america unfortunately mosport is quite primitive in some of the facilities available im thinking of the media in particular so i hope the teams fans get to read about whats going on when it happens and not sometime after the event
5589288 turns one two and four are blind very fast downhill turns very challenging and dangerous one mistake and you are in the wall this is like the kink in road america but you have the kink three times in one lap at mosport its very cool when you drive trough these turns here you really can feel how much downforce a gt streetcar has that is really amazing
5589289 to prepare myself i went back home to germany to train mentally and physically in daily sports that helps to stay focused and fit during this important and dangerous race dirk is also a very well trained driver that is a key for success
5589290 the car was just perfect in road america tony dowe technical director gave dirk and me a perfectly balanced car that helped at the fast race track in road america and i am a 100 percent sure he will do the same for mosport that will make us quick in the fast downhill turns
5589291 it pushes me even more i am thinking about the championship and racing every single second i am more focused than ever i train hard everyday to give the best of what i can do to dirk tony and tafel racing i am very happy to have such an experienced team behind me
5589292 i am really looking forward to get back to mosport my memories are really good on this track it has always been a lot of fun and i have had a lot of success here there is definitely time to attack but you need to be very cautious not to risk too much the runoffs are hungry and not very comfortable i know from last year that the track suits the ferrari dom was quick there as well so with the ferrari tafel racing the michelin tires and the drivers we are looking forward to a great race
5589293 being in gt2 at mosport nearly every corner is quite challenging the easiest is the hairpin but it is also one of the most important ones
5589294 i am very happy about the competition in our class this pushes everybody on the team to give their best to receive always the maximum we dont need to win every week but we like to be ahead at the end of the year it is so tight right now in points that i believe it will come down to the last race in the last lap
5589295 mosport is known as one of the fastest and most challenging courses in the world it forces you to feel when and where to brake versus having visual cones and markers like most of the other tracks we run it is similar to road america in that you roll through the corners at a higher rate of speed than what you would think they would be turn four the blind left hander is really challenging it takes laps and laps to be able to build the confidence to achieve optimum speed and line to get through turn four at a competitive pace
5589296 we realize that all fishers may not agree but it is essential that we have a fishery that is under control
5589297 an all herring diet affects the colour of the meat and lowers the price thats one of the major reasons we are not extending the quota now
5589298 even small traces are extremely toxic as they persist in the body for a long time and accumulate in the human tissues

5589318 they have been separated for almost a year but remain close friends
5589319 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5589320 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5589321 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5589322 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5589323 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5589324 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5589325 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5589326 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5589327 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5589328 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5589329 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5589330 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5589331 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5589332 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5589333 i dont think it was that ragey but its all a matter of perspective i guess

5589335 the way they played last year for me was too direct i have my philosophy as to how you want to attack and i thought last year was too direct
5589336 its like they tried to find wambach too early we also wanted to find wambach in our matches too because she is a great player but we wanted to be more patient in the attack
5589337 when abby wambach broke her leg just before going to the olympics the two players up front had to play a little different and more players are now scoring goals
5589338 i went into the woods to find me a bear and when i found him i began to read to him from the catechism well that bear wanted nothing to do with me and began to slap me around so i quickly grabbed my holy water sprinkled him and said holy mary mother of god he became as gentle a lamb the bishop is coming out next week to give him first communion and confirmation
5589339 well brothers you know that we dont sprinkle i went out and i found me a bear and then i began to read to my bear from gods holy word but that bear wanted nothing to do with me so i took hold of him and we began to wrestle we wrestled down one hill up another and down another until we came to a creek so right quick like i dunked him and baptized his hairy soul and just like you said he became as gentle as a lamb we spent the rest of the day praising jesus

5589408 is connected youre not sure exactly what he does or where hes from but you want to hang out with him
5589409 i must say im not very happy about the updates they have made

5589447 they member states should eliminate gender discrimination and stereotypes in the curriculum career choices and professions while putting in place gender sensitivity training programmes for educators and stakeholders

5589509 hell be pitching a knuckleball until hes 40 while the other guys who throw will be done at 35
5589510 i would guess he has a two year window to prove himself and if he gets to the big leagues at 33 he could pitch until hes 40 if you sign a pitcher with the thought that he can pitch for you in the big leagues for seven years you sign him
5589511 ive seen him throw a good knuckleball so its just a matter now if he can throw his best knuckleball in the clutch all the time
5589512 i am a complete foodie i do diet but i love to eat with my families and my girlfriend luckily i am blessed with good genes so there is no major exercise regime

5589515 luck by chance is set in the film industry and farhan and zoya asked all their friends which means practically the whole industry to do walk on parts unlike om shanti om which got the stars in only for a song this one has space all through for stars to walk in and out
5589516 this one lends itself well to playback singing i got to do a lot of singing in rock on id say luck by chance helped me open up as an actor rock on was a role i could easily identify with but i had to work a lot harder for my sister
5589517 ive been taking instructions from her all my life ive always obeyed her i just had to go from being her designated driver to a designated actor
5589518 fortunately zoya was always open to suggestions and there would be quite a lot of give and take on the sets
5589519 i am a complete foodie i do diet but i love to eat with my families and my girlfriend luckily i am blessed with good genes so there is no major exercise regime

5589543 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed but when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security

5589570 owais is going to bat at number three for the simple fact that i think he was wasted at number seven
5589571 he got a one day hundred against india last year and has got runs this year and i am going to give him the confidence to bat at number three with myself at number four

5589599 the iranian development and testing of rockets is troubling and raises further questions about their intentions
5589600 this action and dual use possibilities for their ballistic missile programme have been a subject of iaea discussions and are inconsistent with their un security council obligations
5589601 iran still has a long way to go as far as satellites are concerned and it deliberately exaggerates its air and space successes in order to dissuade israel or the united states from attacking its nuclear sites
5589602 it is clear that for years iran has had shihab 3 ballistic missiles which put israel within its reach but the threat posed by iran comes from its nuclear programme and not from its satellites or ballistic missiles
5589603 iranian experts can put the national satellite into orbit in the not too distant future

5589648 jangan ada mana mana pihak yang bertindak menjadi polis biarkan pihak polis yang buat kerja
5589649 saya ini bukanlah antipolis jadi kita buatlah apa yang mereka suruh asal jangan bertentangan dengan apa yang kita mahu kita bukan mahu keganasan kita mahu satu perubahan
5589650 saya rasa pemimpin pemimpin parti dan penyokong perlu menghormati tugas dan tanggungjawab polis
5589651 saya rasa membimbangkan apabila mendengar ada perkembangan tidak sihat tapi spr akan terus menjalankan tugas untuk memastikan kelancaran proses pilihan raya
5589652 kalau orang ramai bimbang akan berlaku keganasan dan ada orang tidak peraturan ini akan menyebabkan minat orang ramai untuk mengambil bahagian dalam pilihan raya akan terjejas
5589653 kami menolak keganasan kesal dengan apa yang berlaku mahu siasatan faktanya kekal dalam sejarah pilihan raya kecil di malaysia yang pernah mati bukannya penyokong bn yang pernah maut adalah penyokong pembangkang
5589654 saya merujuk kepada pilihan raya kecil padang terap 1986 dalam tragedi lubuk merbau semasa lawatan petang datuk seri najib tun razak ketika itu ketua pemuda di felda lubuk merbau
5589655 penyokong pas yang mati dipukul dengan batu bata ialah osman talib 33 dia adalah ahli pas yang dipukul oleh samseng umno itu adalah fakta yang jangan dilupakan

5589677 isa 5 14 o the pharisees seemed to be without hope as well for jesus asks them how they will escape their sentence to hell mat 23 33 gt hell will be full of entire cultures o in matthew 11 23 christ warns that the entire city of capernaum will be brought down into hell gt hell will be full of regular people o jesus warns in the famous passage a passage that many misinterpret that it is better to dismember yourself to keep yourself pure than to have your whole body cast into hell mat 5 27 30 o jesus wants us to fear god rather than man for god can destroy both body and soul in hell mat 10 28 o lets not forget the parable of the rich man and lazarus wherein the rich man is tormented in the flames of hell cf luke 16 23 o in the end times after the resurrection of the dead those who are not found in the book of life in the final judgment will be cast into the lake of fire rev 20 13 15 this is not hell but where hell will end up the one who conquers will have this heritage the new heaven and the new earth and i will be his god and he will be my son but as for the cowardly the faithless the detestable as for murderers the sexually immoral sorcerers idolaters and all liars their portion will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur which is the second death
5589678 for even the son of man came not to be served but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many

5589763 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5589764 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5589765 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5589766 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5589767 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5589768 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks

5589812 political activists are doing journalists work for them by blogging and commentating as though they were professional journalists and being taken increasingly seriously as such including by professional journalists who routinely cite them as authorities in news stories

5589814 the honest pr agent helping the client towards clarity and their intelligent conversation with a well meaning reporter who in turn conveys a complex truth to the world
5589815 and as weve found with dead fish gate some activists are even turning unwary journalists into political activists by selectively leaking them choice tidbits of covertly taped conversations unable to resist journalists are effectively running party spin holus bolus
5589816 were in a new era where whats generally taken as journalism has been democratised by the internet and as with old fashioned radio talkback its hard to tell whether the information providers are accurate biased or simply malicious
5589817 i cant even decide whether its a good thing or a bad thing this job poaching first up best dressed let the market decide and all that but morally and practically its now the wild west out there because we can no longer easily tell where journalism ends and politics begins we used to be separate species but now were hybridising

5589846 wow isnt it interesting how sometimes we are so quick to find reasons why something wouldnt work
5589847 i absolutely expected that the communist party would rescue me so i stayed calm and waited for that to happen
5589848 when i lent us 27 to 42 people in 1976
5589849 in a small village next to the university where i taught i had no idea that it would be the beginning of a new banking methodology and it would spread in every country of the world it feels very strange to realise that until then we lived with a banking methodology which kept the doors of the banks closed to the two thirds of world population grameen freed banking from the limitations of collateral
5589850 lasting peace cannot be achieved unless large population groups find ways in which to break out of poverty micro credit is one such means development from below also serves to advance democracy and human rights
5589851 muhammad yunus has shown himself to be a leader who has managed to translate visions into practical action for the benefit of millions of people not only in bangladesh but also in many other countries
5589852 loans to poor people without any financial security had appeared to be an impossible idea from modest beginnings three decades ago yunus has first and foremost through grameen bank developed micro credit into an ever more important instrument in the struggle against poverty grameen bank has been a source of ideas and models for the many institutions in the field of micro credit that have sprung up around the world
5589853 yunuss long term vision is to eliminate poverty in the world that vision cannot be realised by means of micro credit alone but muhammad yunus and grameen bank have shown that in the continuing efforts to achieve it micro credit must play a major part
5589854 hillary and i first met muhammad yunus when i was governor
5589855 and he inspired us to create a micro finance programme in arkansas based on his model muhammad proved that the poor are creditworthy and that a micro finance effort can be self sustainable create growth and spread peace because of his efforts millions of people most of them women have had the chance to improve their lives and we are all better off as a result i have thought for years that he deserved the nobel peace prize the committee could not have selected anyone better
5589856 it feels very strange to realise that until then we lived with a banking methodology which kept the doors of the banks closed to the two thirds of world population
5589857 professor yunus is an extraordinary visionary whose unshakeable belief in the power of people to help themselves escape poverty has become a rallying call across the globe today the experiment he launched in 1976 with a mere 27 has swelled into a movement that has reached millions of poor people with financial services the staff and borrowers of grameen bank have responded to his leadership and bold model and created a tremendous success story that is now spreading throughout the world
5589858 more than one billion people are condemned to live on less than us 1 per day
5589859 such a crisis demands tangible solutions put into practice on a wide scale it requires leadership from civil society and governments microfinance is one of the most powerful solutions to poverty in existence today and dr yunus is the leader most responsible for developing and implementing it in bangladesh and globally
5589860 you are a person wholly committed to making a difference in the lives of the poor and someone who feels deeply about working for peace and justice around the world
5589861 my experience showed me that all the ingredients for ending poverty for an individual comes neatly packaged within the person himself a human being is born in this world fully equipped not only to take care of himself but also to contribute in enlarging the well being of the world as a whole then why should one billion plus people on the planet suffer through a lifetime of misery and indignity and spend every moment of their lives looking for food for physical survival alone
5589862 with just a small amount of money those trapped by poverty have a chance to invest in items such as livestock or materials for handicrafts which can lead to economic selfsufficiency through micro credit programs the worlds poorest people are leading their families their communities and their countries to a better future a future that dr yunus has been instrumental in creating
5589863 i became involved because poverty was all around me and i could not turn away from it
5589864 i decided to make a list of the victims of this money lending business in the village next door to our campus
5589865 when my list was done it had the names of 42 victims who borrowed a total amount of us 27 i offered us 27 from my own pocket to get these victims out of the clutches of those money lenders the excitement that was created among the people by this small action got me further involved in it if i could make so many people so happy with such a tiny amount of money why not do more of it
5589866 first we must understand that poverty is not created by the poor people
5589867 the first thing i did was to try to persuade the bank located in the campus to lend money to the poor but that did not work the bank said that the poor were not creditworthy after all my efforts over several months failed i offered to become a guarantor for the loans to the poor i was stunned by the result the poor paid back their loans on time every time but still i kept confronting difficulties in expanding the programme through the existing banks that was when i decided to create a separate bank for the poor and in 1983 i finally succeeded in doing that i named it grameen bank or village bank
5589868 since it introduced them in 1984 housing loans have been used to construct 640 000 houses the legal ownership of these houses belongs to the women themselves we focussed on women because we found giving loans to women always brought more benefits to the family
5589869 his tireless endeavour to root out poverty and create a new model of giving credit to the poor it will bear fruit in terms of greater peace in the world

5589897 at the outset you may be wondering why i have used the words claiming to be the head of state

5589899 it happened two days ago he was trying to cross the bridge when a russian soldier at a checkpoint opened fire for no reason he was shot twice in the chest and once in the head we buried him the same day my father died fighting for the red army in the second world war and i served as a soviet guard on the turkish border i had never harmed russia why did they murder my son
5589900 we have come here from our village five kilometres away which had been destroyed
5589901 thank god the russians did not let the ossetians in but where is the georgian army and the georgian government we have russians driving around in tanks in our city
5589902 the russian troops have been very kind they give chocolates to the children and cigarettes to the men we are now afraid of what will happen if they leave we think that the ossetian militia will simply come in and there will be trouble we do not believe that the trouble is over it is frightening at night and we can hear gunfire in surrounding areas we need international forces here as soon as possible
5589903 we have to get behind him because he is a tremendous force and is of tremendous importance for the team
5589904 what happened in the transfer period did not always reflect his deep desire and there was manipulation from agents on both sides but overall i am positive he will recover
5589905 a minicab pulled up and there was a guy in the back who was really drunk who started shouting you fucking paki
5589906 our friends were there and said look mate we dont want any problems just go away because youre being racist then the same guy came back and walked towards nilanthan and threw a punch he must have had a blade in his hand because he ended up with a slashed throat
5589907 it was a little blade but blood just went everywhere i took my shirt off to help and it was soaked right through
5589908 words cant express how i feel right now my brother is gone but every day every second we will be thinking of him he was energetic always giving a helping hand whenever it was needed my father cannot accept his only son is dead he keeps repeating the words hes gone over and over again

5589910 the lettings market is booming with many vendors opting to rent their property while sales in the housing market continue to dry up
5589911 many are willing to hold and await the return of capital appreciation becoming a landlord is now an increasingly profitable option with rising rents and yields offering good returns
5589912 established investors have been reaping the benefits of the housing downturn for some time and will continue to do so in the short term however ever increasing supply could have an impact on rental growth as tenant options increase
5589913 this is a drastic measure and will usually result in taking on a much greater level of mortgage debt than originally planned at a time when credit is more expensive and not as freely available
5589914 borrowers need to fully understand the costs and risks that come with being a landlord before putting additional stress on their finances both properties are likely to be subject to larger mortgages and payments need to be met whether there are tenants in place or not
