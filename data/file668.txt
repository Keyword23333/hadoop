6680002 we love the arts and baby einstein has brought music and nature into our home in such a wonderful meaningful way
6680003 as a parent its easy to see why baby einstein is a mom favorite around the world
6680004 thousands of parents have shared personal stories with me about how their babies faces light up when they hear baby einstein music
6680005 it reinforces that after 10 years we remain true to our vision of helping parents and babies discover and share the beauty of classic timeless images and sounds
6680006 even in a year in which the economy has been struggling our events are still attended well because companies understand more and more the importance of being found on search engines as an integral part of their marketing strategies
6680007 as we mourn our brothers who lost their lives during the napeitom massacre in turkana south by east pokot pastoralists i am also sorry to inform you that turkana herdsmen who were migrating to uganda in search of water and pasture have been bombed by the uganda peoples defence forces
6680008 we are not happy at all with our government the soldiers have killed a dozen of our people and the authorities dont raise a finger
6680009 government officials have not even bothered to visit the area
6680010 i didnt decide to run for president to start a national crusade for the political reforms i believed in or to run a campaign as if it were some grand act of patriotism in truth i wanted to be president because it had become my ambition to be president in truth id had the ambition for a long time
6680011 i feel people should get off our back and realize theres some parity in this game
6680012 a lot of these guys were in the dominican and venezuelan summer leagues they want to grow fast and a related factor is that when they get here theyre generally younger than the guys theyre competing with most of whom were drafted out of college so sometimes they look for a shortcut but there are no shortcuts
6680013 we continue to talk about in detail to prospects its like pfp pitchers fielding practice repeat repeat repeat i think we also have to make sure we have bilingual doctors in latin america who understand the commissioners drug policy
6680014 i would rather lose a game than take a chance of hurting anybody
6680015 you cant stress enough that the hero stuff sometimes works in the world but it doesnt work here
6680016 just like this happened with some questionable home run calls something else will happen a play at first a play at second its not going to end its like pandoras box be careful what you wish for
6680017 i dont care if were on a 50 game trip

6680027 42 members of the south african national defence force sandf are currently under suspension on full pay and that a significant number of them have been suspended for more than one year
6680028 the sandf has spent a total of r10907429 on suspended members salaries over the past three financial years an average of r3 6m each year this is an astonishing waste of money that could have been better spent on training and equipment which are currently in perilously short supply it is unacceptable that it should take this long for the sandf to process and conclude its disciplinary matters particularly since its suspended members are able to enjoy full remuneration at the governments expense for periods of years rather than months

6680030 we have deviated somewhat from our core mission i think the first place we have to look is at our preventative services
6680031 prevention is critically important but we cant be the safety net for every child in the city if we try to do that we will fail at our core mission
6680032 we are the system of last resort when all else fails it falls on us but it cant all fall on one agency
6680033 ive been to every convention since 1980 and ive never seen a fork
6680034 youve been to many conventions have you ever seen a fork
6680035 if they dont allow forks on airplanes anymore they shouldnt allow them on the floor of the democratic convention

6680040 were capable of hitting weve hit for the last 3 1 2 years and have a lot of the same guys i know we can hit but i cant tell you when its going to get going i think every guy in that room knows we can play better
6680041 i think our guys know exactly what they have to do
6680042 they know where we are at how many games we have to go and what we need to do to win
6680043 i dont want fans to get on him for my situation
6680044 whenever we define a pre viable fetus as a person that is protected by the constitution what were really saying is that they are persons entitled to the kinds of protections provided to a child that determination would forbid abortions to take place
6680045 ok ma ora che faccio dove devo cliccare che devo fare per iniziare
6680046 off a slow pace like that you cant be surprised when these girls come up on you you have to be ready to go and i didnt have it to go
6680047 coming off the curve i was actually in a pretty good position she said
6680048 it actually really opened up thats whats so disappointing i saw daylight and really went backwards instead of staying up and staying loose i got tight and that was it
6680049 the olympics in front of thousands i wanted it really bad
6680050 maybe im just not as fit as i thought i was she said

6680052 mega is acting as a facilitator of the project as part of our mandate to attract new investment into the province we are still in the process of finding suitable investors to start the project
6680053 the facility will probably be built to international standards and will be able to host national and international meetings like the one in durban conferences and banquets as well as concerts and selected indoor sporting events will also be accommodated not just for the world cup but beyond that
6680054 there is definitely quite a bit more pressure this week especially after the loss last week
6680055 it is not a good experience to get no points in a game and the guys want to make up for that
6680056 every coach has his particular style and we are playing the way the coach wants us to play but the breakdowns have been a big problem
6680057 we run into gaps and we have shown that we have the capability to score tries but i feel that if we are going to win matches then we are going to have to commit players to the breakdown a lot more than we are at present
6680058 we have lost important possession at crucial stages of the past few games and it has cost us

6680072 that study from the business council should ring alarm bells in every household in the country because what it means in plain language is fewer jobs higher costs and electricity higher costs on gas and higher costs right through our economy
6680073 this crime is a particularly unpalatable one its motivated simply by greed
6680074 she said she didnt want him to suffer but he was going to turf them out and wasnt treating them as his own children

6680076 warning of severe erosion risk by 2040 needs to be on the ad like a cigarette packet perhaps
6680077 there will be losses there will be damaging events and we need to accept that fact
6680078 it is an issue of significant magnitude and it does need proper assessment and all governments working together to minimise the risks and ensure there is as little damage as possible
6680079 this really is very early work and many more factors need to be taken into account before we have concrete projections
6680080 it is going to be a negative story leading to damage of assets and loss of value

6680100 the defence ministry has frozen military cooperation with the alliance
6680101 in the phone call president bush said that the united states is looking for russian compliance with the agreement to withdraw their forces and an end to their siege of georgia
6680102 i cant imagine a circumstance right now that we would engage in military cooperation with the russians until the situation in georgia is resolved

6680122 everyone from jamaica was running fast i had to do my part
6680123 i think you can imagine how i feel pretty devastated
6680124 i knew i should have been stronger i saw her campbell brown cruise right by me i expected more from myself
6680125 the main thing was to get away from her felix and the rest of the field its competition over the years and its always u s versus jamaica in most of the sprint events its our job its our career
6680126 i was confident about how things would go i love china and liu xiang is my friend i know he is very big in china

6680129 i do think we are going to see attacks i think we have been seeing attacks already going on in the field
6680130 were doing everything we can to mitigate and reduce its incidence
6680131 there are other scenarios that i cant unfortunately get into
6680132 the online underworld is poised to launch targeted attacks in coming weeks
6680133 the most important thing for people to patch are the name servers that back up their mail servers
6680134 the good news is that there are hundreds of millions of users protected against these attacks the bad news is its not everybody
6680135 the best minds are not in government if any were business would hire them away
6680136 these are my principles if you dont like them i have others
6680137 we cant afford a shopping trip when a quarter of the nation lives on food aid

6680141 im really concerned about the cost of this and that it will just explode
6680142 theres no way that between equipment manpower outside production were going to do this anywhere near 30 000
6680143 do you still count new fullmetal alchemist good or bad idea
6680144 last month in everett alone we saw 350 new families
6680145 the way the economy is gas prices what they are people whove always lived on the edge can no longer provide for their families on their own theyve never been to a food bank and theres hundreds of them
6680146 when youre out there talking to people you find that everybody is aware of the problem everybody wants to help they just dont know how to take that first step
6680147 everybody thinks about it during the holidays and thats when most companies and individual donors get out their checkbooks or sponsor their annual food drives unfortunately hunger doesnt take a vacation
6680148 maybe the easiest solution has been staring us in the face all along
6680149 this way were collecting and transporting donations at the same time were promoting public transportation and which ever agencies jump on board have something they can feel good about doing for the community
6680150 this is the kind of drive we need to get us through these tough economic times and mark isnt taking no for an answer
6680151 people dont donate because they dont know where the food bank is so lets make the process more simple
6680152 the bus people or whichever agency can take the food to whatever food bank they want and all thats left for the food bank volunteers is putting the stuff on the shelves
6680153 kim called me all frantic saying where do i go what do i do
6680154 if it werent for her i dont think id have housing
6680155 all of us share this challenge public health has always been the poor stepchild of medicine
6680156 when public health does its work really well no one knows about it
6680157 fifteen years of flat funding from the county about three years of flat funding from the state flat funding from the feds and the economic downturn
6680158 later this month i will extend invitations to representatives of the health district cities the county council my executive team and other community groups to discuss this strategy and our next steps
6680159 frankly we do not have the 150 000 to pay for that
6680160 im sorry that they have to lay off people but we may have to lay off people too
6680161 i believe there are a number of steps we should consider prior to making any cuts in service to the public of staff layoffs
6680162 the county has historically advocated that the health district spend down its reserve as opposed to increasing any funding
6680163 thats a pattern thats been established for the past six years so the assumption would be that if thats the case when that reserve runs out the councils responsible for a plan to replace the funding
6680164 came as kind of a shock to all of us
6680165 everyone is an all star you dont have to deal with guys who cant compete
6680166 its good baseball with the best guys around theres just something special about doing that in safeco
6680167 any time you play with the 25 best players around its tough
6680168 youre not always going to get hits still the guys showed their stuff out there some of our competitors have been around the country so for us to play at safeco against the best guys out there is great
6680169 its still fun to be out here it was a good old fashioned football game americas game its something that not a lot of people can still do youve got to cherish every minute that youre able to be out here and just take advantage of it and have fun
6680170 today what i liked so much about this game is that snohomish county could have called it in but they played with a great deal of pride and that starts with the leadership in their organization
6680171 theyre a top notch first class organization i knew they would represent themselves very well on their home field so we expected a hard game
6680172 we wanted to go out with a bang and beat the top team in the league
6680173 i wish we had played a little bit better to get ready for the playoffs
6680174 champions always figure out a way to win so today we showed why were champions
6680175 what i liked is our defense was starting to come together
6680176 they werent wrapping up as well as i liked but were playing a heck of a team we forced some turnovers
6680177 when youre tackling and making them turn the ball over to you or making them fumble that means youre hitting hard and trying to peel that ball out those are both good things
6680178 ninety nine percent of the guys that are here are going to be back
6680179 if we can get his passing accuracy where it needs to be he is going to be amazing hal can run he had no fear of those guys he can play
6680180 he led his team like a veteran quarterback should do its going to be exciting next year to get ready to play him
6680181 our personnel kind of changed a lot over the last few weeks
6680182 we went from having a lot of running backs and not a lot of skill guys to not a lot of running backs and lot of skill guys receivers and slot guys so weve got to take advantage of whatever youve got we came out throwing the ball around we kind of changed it up and went back to the double wing t in the first half and kind of caught them off balance and got a little momentum going
6680183 we were able to shut them down when we needed to
6680184 it was an up and down season a tale of two teams
6680185 when we had our full squad and we were healthy we played well when we were missing quite a few starters we just had a rough stretch
6680186 theyre the favorite to win i think and they will do well nationally
6680187 they start coming when they see weve got a quarterback like we have a big tall rangy guy that can throw the ball or put and put pressure on the defense
6680188 da qnd ci siamo parlati lulrima volta nn faccio altro ke pensarti e mi piacerebbe uscire di nuovo cn te

6680200 the key distinctions between the open and gated communities are as follows
6680201 for firms community development offers the possibility to gain developmental assistance in noncritical areas and increase adoption west 2003
6680202 private ownership of source code private ownership of the code acts to dismantle the collective development process in a variety of ways most noticeably ownership by the firm creates the possibility that the developer will not have access to the code at a later date participants value the results of their efforts and expect to continue using the software well into the future the open source project gave them this right but the gated source project did not make this guarantee private ownership also appears to inhibit reciprocity if the firm is not donating the code to the community why should the developer take additional time and effort to donate code to the firm restrictions on use modification and distribution the restrictions placed on the gated code with respect to commercial use modification and distribution all act to reduce the degrees of freedom that an individual can exercise when using and creating the code particularly when compared to open source licensing arrangements these restrictions can be thought of as limiting the value available to the individual developer i e the developer can only use the code for certain purposes modifications made and deployed must meet community standards rather than his own preferences and the code may only be shared with others willing to abide by the communitys governance arrangements thereby decreasing the volume of subsequent improvements and feedback that many developers relish on the other hand these restrictions might create value for the company restrictions on commercial use in the gated source community created additional problems because licensing terms were negotiated with the firm on an individual basis this decreased trust dramatically by creating the possibility of ex post hold up problems restrictions on commercial use with terms set in advance and applicable to everyone may be less problematic proprietary modifications a large part of the longstanding debate between free and open source software advocates concerns proprietary modifications software derived from free software cannot be made proprietary

6680239 people in the age group of 25 to 50 are most at risk the neurons that tell people in the crucial age range not to over eat are being killed off
6680240 when the stomach is empty it triggers the ghrelin hormone that notifies the brain that we are hungry when we are full a set of neurons known as pomcs kick in
6680241 however free radicals created naturally in the body attack the pomc neurons this process causes the neurons to degenerate overtime affecting our judgement as to when our hunger is satisfied
6680242 a diet rich in carbohydrate and sugar that has become more and more prevalent in modern societies over the last 20 30 years has placed so much strain on our bodies that its leading to premature cell deterioration
6680243 this report from wisdom study is reassuring that there are real benefits for some women electing to use hrt
6680244 while it has been well established that quality of life measures are improved in younger symptomatic women this paper adds some information that even older women may benefit
6680245 while some of this information was reported from the whi which used the same hormonal regimen more sensitive instruments were used in wisdom which was able to show improvements in other measures such as sexual function
6680246 while this is important information and is reassuring regarding the benefits of hrt these findings in isolation are not an indication to initiate hormones in asymptomatic older women for the first time
6680247 it shows that hrt can offer real benefits to most women experiencing menopausal symptoms our advice remains the same each woman is an individual and she needs to discuss whats right for her with her doctor in the light of her medical history

6680257 america is like a healthy body and its resistance is threefold its patriotism its morality and its spiritual life if we can undermine these three areas america will collapse from within

6680259 when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6680260 when an audience does not complain it is a compliment amp when they do it is a compliment too if unaccompanied by violence
6680261 the men american people admire most extravagantly are the most daring liars

6680269 one of the teachers called some indian students derogatory names
6680270 my 10 year old son was lifted up by the ears by a male teacher and slapped and kicked for talking before entering the classroom after recess in february

6680278 we extend our gratitude to our readers in making us the most read technology magazine we will continue to work hard towards bringing them relevant and authoritative content on technology
6680279 and so to look at starcraft and say well we could make an mmo out of that well yeah but how many years would we have to invest in it to create the quantity of content and the quality of experience that would be required to meet just the minimum standard thats set by the games that are out there right now
6680280 weve made it very difficult for ourselves and its an overwhelming thought
6680281 ive been there at blizzard since we started on wow and its been a very long and arduous journey and to think about taking that journey again with the starcraft franchise is a little scary it makes an rts like starcraft 2 seem very achievable
6680282 information from this study could be the beginning of a systematic approach to develop a method of predicting pain threshold and morphine requirement for pain relief
6680283 prescription sleeping pills can be important in certain situations but they can cause a lot of adverse effects and are not a long term solution for older people sleep medication can increase the risk of falling as well as interfering with other medicines

6680285 my god hobarts even got the railroad on its side
6680286 it is fascinating to observe how individual proteins can determine addictive behavioural patterns
6680287 in addition our results open up whole new prospects for treating addiction thus blocking the nr1 receptor might protect from relapsing into addiction selective activation of glur1 would even contribute to extinguishing the addiction

6680290 all my life i want to be a brickie work work work
6680291 i always thought i was lucky playing on that brand new field
6680292 russ was tough and he demanded everything out of you
6680293 a lot of people hated him when they played for him but when you got older you understood what he did and why he did it
6680294 we all loved playing in the bowl it was our home and we wanted to defend it all the players we looked up to as kids played there and when it was our turn to play there we knew it was special
6680295 my god hobarts even got the railroad on its side
6680296 the penn game really started it all what we did was special i dont know if anything like that can ever happen again
6680297 it was the toughest place to play in the region probably in the state if indiana
6680298 the fans were on you the players would be scared no matter how hard you tried to get them to just play
6680299 theyd look across the field and see that giant of a man howell and he was intimidating the brickie bowl was the same way
6680300 i dont know if i can watch hobart play home games in any place other than the bowl
6680301 at my age its a good day when i wake up
6680302 i dont get to as many games as i used to but id like to get to a few games this year it brings back a lot of memories and all of them are pretty special

6680305 the provision of infertility treatment has not been seen as a traditional nhs service and therefore is often viewed as a relatively low priority compared to more visible conditions whose impact is well established
6680306 the groups final report will seek to consider the often unseen consequences of infertility including the impact on mental health and general wellbeing which may draw on other nhs services for treatment as well as the positive benefits of ivf
6680307 it is appropriate for ivf to be considered carefully for inclusion on the national tariff
6680308 this is a positive development clinicians and practitioners involved in infertility services are all aware that we are not just dealing with physical pathology
6680309 infertility is a disease but it also has fallout beyond that for a significant proportion of couples causing mental health problems depression stress related illnesses and so on

6680317 moving around in the city and looking and searching in different places
6680318 we are waiting for the russians to respect their word
6680319 we waited twice with dashed hopes this time it appears that there is at least the beginning of a fulfillment
6680320 its not they its we who will erase them from the face of earth
6680321 we want everyone to know the truth about the terrible events in tskhinvali with the hope that such a thing will never again happen on our land
6680322 we anticipate staying as long as there is need and helping to set up the economy because its very important that the economy begins to take on its normal aspects but it depends on our ability to do full assessments throughout georgia

6680327 my dear brothers and sisters the law of chastity is a principle of eternal significance we must not be swayed by the many voices of the world we must listen to the voice of the lord and then determine that we will set our feet irrevocably upon the path he has marked

6680330 are core political speech and his online display and sale of those shirts is fully protected by the first amendment
6680331 his web site is like a streetside table used to disseminate anti war and political messages in a variety of ways including displaying and selling his message bearing t shirts
6680332 the nations debt to its fallen soldiers may not be paid by giving their families a toll on free speech the debt must be paid but in other ways
6680333 for the free speech rights of all political activists in arizona regardless of how controversial or unpopular their message might be
6680334 congress voted in support of the war and dan frazier exploited heros and profited from their deaths instead of helping their families
6680335 it went very very smoothly and professionally the whale suffered as little as possible
6680336 because every day it seems that you find a way by innuendo or any other means to put women down
6680337 i put down liberals if they happen to be women i put em down
6680338 rush limbaugh has been the leading political talk show host in america and talk radio has been one of the leading forces in american politics
6680339 limbaugh is to talk radio what elvis presley was to rock and roll presley was its biggest star but he was not its only star
6680340 i didnt hire rush limbaugh or put him on the air in new york to be a conservative talk show host
6680341 i brought him to be a talk show personality the fact that he was more conservative than liberal was not of interest to me other than the fact that i saw an opening there i realized if i was all liberal all day i was not reaching the vast total audience
6680342 limbaugh is just off the charts talented and after that there was a need for a real conservative and so conservatives rallied around him and liberals rallied to hate him
6680343 he is no longer just the populist mouthpiece he is not someone who takes talking points from the white house or newt gingrich
6680344 he is the center of gravity or at least close to it of conservatives but not the republican party
6680345 does he believe he has talent on loan from god no that was part of the shtick that he did
6680346 the part that he takes very seriously are his convictions about politics or about government or about society
6680347 i did have people who were sort of pseudo conservatives who last week would have been liberals who would have done anything that you wanted them to do on the air i was convinced when i met limbaugh and his brother that they were the real deal
6680348 limbaugh is to talk radio what elvis presley was to rock and roll presley was its biggest star but he was not its only star
6680349 i hadnt really thought about it just being together with her was almost as if almost almost like a drug
6680350 thats perhaps an extreme way of saying it i just wanted to live an obscure life in baltimore
6680351 it was given to me by the one person to whom ive always looked up to one person whom ive known since i was small
6680352 he has been passionate about the bid from the early stages he played a key role in singapore and he was brought up within a stones throw of the olympic park in london
6680353 this is not the moment we want to try and compete with the truly astonishing job bocog did with their ceremonies
6680354 its also great opportunity to celebrate the outstanding success of the british team in these games
6680355 its an opportunity for them to show that they know how to do it
6680356 in this regard a bad choice hurts much more than a good choice helps
6680357 i think a week from tomorrow we will all know
6680358 whenever there is change in the market we see organisations focus more on their financials
6680359 we see extra sets of eyes looking at the books and we see that the accounting people are really central to the business
6680360 from experience the accounting industry generally doesnt feel it until 12 months later
6680361 the work required isnt as great because the transactions are smaller ive seen that happen a few times now like in the mid 90s
6680362 being overworked and stressed due to staffing issues is not a winning attraction strategy for anyone in or wanting to enter the profession
6680363 its a very big part of many employers strategies to look at their competitors and look at their staff

6680370 quello che conta di piu e il servizio siamo entusiasti di poter accettare la carta postepay delle poste italiane e la riteniamo un metodo sicuro e ragionevole di pagare per permettere alla nostra clientela italiana di ottenere quanto di meglio il giappone ha da offrire
6680371 michele ha recentemente aggiunto un contributo sulla carta postepay nel blog italiano di rinkya http rinkya it blogspot com e incoraggiamo i nostri clienti italiani a darci unocchiata
6680372 parte dellobiettivo di rinkya e sempre stato anche quello di cercare di riunire il mondo attraverso lesperienza dello shopping
6680373 la creazione de il blog italiano di rinkya e laccettazione della carta postepay delle poste italiane sono un altro passo proprio verso quellobiettivo anche fare del business assieme puo essere un gesto che aiuta a conoscersi e a comprendersi reciprocamente e collezionare significa anche capire unaltra cultura e un arricchimento nella nostra vita e quale migliore via esiste se non lo shopping dopo tutto siamo tutti nati per fare shopping
6680374 i did it its sort of like shopping with training wheels and shopping as everyone knows is what we are born to do
6680375 i started thinking about that when i expanded rinkya the largest japanese shopping service to add internet malls and stores such as rakuten and amazon to the shopping choices available at rinkya as well as the rinkya blog i mean like its being in the mall hanging out with your friends on the blog window shopping with your mouse or maybe im just a valley girl at heart and wanted the whole wide world as my mall
6680376 the choices available from the internet malls and stores of japan is truly mind blowing
6680377 what weve noticed lately is the run on japanese street fashion internationally
6680378 a lot of the virtual valley girls and boys click through the fashions and other goods that are available in japan just like they were in a mall
6680379 well they say the deepest part of the ocean is in the middle of the pacific ocean so were all really in a big valley at rinkya were building a mall for that valley a place to hang out have some fun and most of all to shop after all shopping is the noblest expression of the human spirit everyone shops it brings the world together all together in one big valley hanging out in a virtual mall like its the place to be fer sure
6680380 it all begins with a passion for purpose a smart shopper and some dedicated well trained experts
6680381 the enthusiasm for consumers to have access to our expert speakers has been high our support and response from breast cancer survivors has also been blessed i look forward to bringing these two together
6680382 earlier this year total systems had moved from my active investment stocks to my tsa watch list after an unexpectedly sharp rise in their long term debt obligations
6680383 i have known for many years of total systems dedication to corporate innovation and their ability to generate new products and services and had been monitoring their progress in bringing their long term debt to shareholder equity back in line
6680384 i have come to trust the s amp p quality rating as a supplement to my own stock selection criteria
6680385 generally but not in every case the target sell price is set at about two standard deviations from the stocks average price range
6680386 our initial stock screening process begins by searching for companies undergoing corporate innovation ci
6680387 our method is based upon a theory of technology that suggests to us that companies undergoing innovation may experience a boost in their stock price within a 3 year period
6680388 when hrc was spun off from the parent company it met many of the initial screening criteria set by tsa for inclusion in our active stock investment lists
6680389 our patented stock selection method discovers companies in global industrial value chains where most new technology is created that drives corporate innovation
6680390 ive always used a team approach but there is less delegating now
6680391 i can do this i can do this i know i can do this
6680392 well only 15 mins and ill have done the full shift so i may as well carry on im so close
6680393 im african american and it would be nice to see an african american for president
6680394 just because a guys black doesnt mean he knows what hes doing
6680395 a lot of christian folks they dont believe in that stuff
6680396 he seems to be a person who can deal with people across the aisle and compromise his whole demeanor i like that about him
6680397 but when you start digging theres not much below the surface other than what youve been hearing the last 30 years
6680398 the vice presidential selection will play a big role along with the debates
6680399 whenever i see him talking hes making full eye contact hes not evasive he seems closer to genuine
6680400 i think mccain will do something more than what bush has done
6680401 do you really believe theres going to be a victory i still feel hes going to do something to help those boys get back
6680402 to act is to live to embody the dreams of man
6680403 we didnt want to parody inspirational teacher movies we wanted to make a movie about a guy who thinks hes living an inspirational teacher movie
6680404 weve been through this before but weve never been this close
6680405 they tried to find some compromise formula to some points its too early to say they reached an agreement on all issues
6680406 he is reluctant to pass it because he cares about his own popularity with the population he tells his people and party that it should be one way maybe he tells rice another thing
6680407 we denounce the visit of mistress of evil condoleezza rice to iraq
6680408 hes not dane cook hes got a more sophisticated everyday take on things he often comes across as a questioner of conventional wisdom but also can be kind of a crank its a fine line to walk when youre dealing with a younger person
6680409 the fact that john mccain dispatched his paid consultant to launch this despicable ad from a so called independent committee shows how desperate he is to change the subject from his shocking disconnect with the economic struggles of the american people
6680410 why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it
6680411 it is a big buy intended to go through the democratic convention
6680412 friendship with someone who doesnt like this country and is an unapologetic terrorist
6680413 he will gut you and show you your heart and smile at you he plays for keeps
6680414 by the time i met him he is a professor of education at the university of illinois
6680415 we served on a board together that had republicans bankers lawyers focused on education
6680416 i talked to him on the phone last friday and he didnt tell me he was sick or anything
6680417 he was a fantastic leader who didnt back down to anybody players owners or reporters
6680418 i saw him in discussions with owners where he was super tough and didnt back down as a player you had to respect that
6680419 i remember the first player rep meeting i went to in 1990
6680420 i was as green as i could possibly be in terms of the union and union matters after listening to him speak for 45 minutes i knew i was in good hands
6680421 career successes as a professional football player and a union leader are unparalleled
6680422 had the clarity of vision to understand that the true best interests of players was not in strikes and picket lines but in partnership with the board rooms of wealthy owners
6680423 eligibility has already been investigated by authorities in the international federation
6680424 if the athletes hadnt been cleared they wouldnt have participated
6680425 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig the international gymnastics federation and ioc
6680426 an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition
6680427 i hope my county will win gold medals but the rest of the world must be convinced
6680428 cool i want everybody to call me that from now on

6680482 were happy to talk to them about potential relationships with our sponsors but weve made it clear there cant be any exceptions to the salary cap rules
6680483 were just introducing him to our sponsors which is really the only measure we can do
6680484 sometimes there are sponsors willing to get on board with them but its very important that we dont make an exception to the rules
6680485 theres potentially an opportunity to do that next year but we need to look at the overall budget before we agree to that

6680487 outside of practice the older players are really getting to know the freshmen and are doing a great job of welcoming them to our team
6680488 were picking up a lot of what coach raeburn and the rest of the staff have given us
6680489 were learning a lot of new terminology but its a lot of the same type of plays we already know in a lot of ways its like learning a foreign language
6680490 this is a new system for everyone the older guys have seen a little of it in the spring but its almost as new for them as it is for the freshmen right now were doing a lot of teaching and building some confidence in our play scheme we want to play fast this year and were working our way up to that
6680491 its easier for the freshmen to get to know six or seven new guys in their particular group in the first few days than it is to meet 120 totally new members of the entire team
6680492 the upperclassmen get a chance to talk to the freshmen and really get to know them as well
6680493 we put the freshmen in positions to shine in the team competition to do something in which they excel everyone sees them making a difference or being the person that helps the group win an event it builds their confidence and helps ease them into the team

6680507 bridget is a free spirit she doesnt ever connect herself to anything
6680508 but shes also like indiana jones its crazy with all these big hats this time the costume designer did such a good job
6680509 once we got there it was more jason bourne like than sisterhood like we had these moped accidents in our first scene so i was on crutches the rest of the time which took away the excitement of walking up those beautiful cobblestones
6680510 im really moved by that last shot at the end jumping off that cliff was really fun because we did it ourselves
6680511 so we have one more month to make fun of you
6680512 we have to its our right weve known her since she was 16
6680513 blake is like our fun she brings in all the music and energy shes so pure and we intend on keeping her that way
6680514 im yelling at him but i cant yell at him
6680515 my dad was the first of the family who got into this business and i never wanted to be
6680516 i was class president on the cheerleading squad and in a competitive show choir and in six different clubs
6680517 my brother threw me into it he told his agent about me and i basically got pressured by my brother i went out for auditions a couple of times i was very very fortunate to get such a huge break right away the first movie was my first job ever
6680518 serena is the star of the show and is supposed to be its emotional heart
6680519 serena is a reformed bad girl and inherently very kind which is not something you can say about many of the characters on the show
6680520 its like sarah jessica parker people associate her with her character and see her in real life dressing very fashionably and looking beautiful and think that shes running around new york like that
6680521 oh and shes the breakout star because shes the blonde
6680522 it was blake tells a tall tale thats im really 5ft 4in and i lie and say im really tall but i have to be wearing stilts all the time our hair and make up girl on gossip girl thought it was really funny and she tacked it to the mirror
6680523 leslie tends to have two tiers of client white hot talent who at any given moment may be the most famous person on the planet and up and comers
6680524 leslie handled katie holmes until tom cruise swooped down in his spaceship and took over her life so its an indication that the industry is taking blakes future very seriously
6680525 ive kissed just three people in my life other than stuff ive done for tv or movies i grew up with the mindset that after work you go to dinner and watch a movie i dont want to go to a club and not wear panties
6680526 if any of us dared to be ridiculous wed get a lot of phone calls from each other saying what were you doing
6680527 gossip girl is heightened reality its sparkling there are outfits we wear in a short scene on the street that cost 50 000 its eye candy its entertainment its gossip
6680528 shooting in the city is wonderful i sometimes think what am i doing what job gets me up at 3 40 in the morning but its a magical place like a character in our show i dont think it would work if it wasnt in new york i cant describe it it just makes me warm and fuzzy
6680529 i have followed her personal and professional lives very closely and people were fascinated by her burgeoning real life romance with badgley not to mention the delicious drama over the apparent mutual dislike between blake and leighton but the ratings indicate that people are more interested in the personal lives of the actors than of the talent
6680530 i like j brand and rag amp bone and the jeans in this movie were a much better fit than last time
6680531 its her character im playing so we talked about it
6680532 i asked are there any pippa tendencies you want to talk about but she said what are you talking about i saw your reading and copied you so i didnt have to worry about doing anything that robin was doing
6680533 shes definitely the kind of actress writers and directors fall in love with literally as well as figuratively
6680534 i predict a career arc for blake similar to uma thurman and before her cybill shepherd she has an unexpected gamine energy which animates her classic film goddess good looks its a rare quality that humanises her to men without detracting from her sex appeal while at the same time the sympathetic characters she has chosen to play appeal to young women she has the air of the female best friend you would have around to dinner and then six months later wonder why she was sleeping with your husband
6680535 we are here to take up the fight against russia

6680541 as blame is being tossed around following the attacks by alleged members of the milf fighters on villages in lanao del norte and saranggani one sad fact remains violence and hatred continue to take their toll on the lives of innocent civilians muslims lumads and christians alike
6680542 in this light we are appealing for any financial aid that you can extend to our brothers and sisters in mindanao who are caught in this strife they are in dire need of medicines water and food supplies
6680543 the recent development has opened old wounds especially among the christians who have been affected by this senseless violence it has also reinforced old prejudices that the moro cannot be trusted to keep his word or that even if you have become his friend he will betray you this could escalate once again into a christian muslim conflict this is unfortunate without the support of the people at the grassroots any moa or peace agreement will be useless
6680544 i had also suspicions about the real agenda of president gloria macapagal arroyo since the moa required philippine constitutional change in order to implement it after the supreme court stopped the signing of the moa the trouble began
6680545 both the milf and the buc reiterate their unwavering moral commitment to pursue the path to peace solidarity justice and development in mindanao and resolve and support the continuation of the peace process between the milf and the government until its successful conclusion is achieved

6680574 weve been hearing the same thing the past two years
6680575 were really not caught up into it until they start cutting the first tree
6680576 when i was a freshman they promised the improvements were going to be here and they promised it last camp in 2007 im never going to see it
6680577 i dont think the reason we lost was because we got out strengthed and teams were better
6680578 i felt it was more internal i think we had too many individuals on the team last year
6680579 i felt i needed to go back to the other role
6680580 its hard to feel the pulse when youre 100 percent into the game
6680581 the biggest thing im trying to do is get the guys to talk to each other more youd see guys walk by on campus last year and they wouldnt even talk to each other thats how our team was
6680582 the last thing the team wants is to meet every tuesday and thursday to go over some book report but i was looking at the players faces and everyone was intrigued you could tell it in their eyes
6680583 it may take both of them for us to achieve our goals this year
6680584 when we thought about the amenities and handiness for our employee base as well as helping with our recruiting efforts going forward when we saw the opportunity to be on elliott we thought it very much met our needs

6680602 it was a lot of pre race dramatics for us
6680603 they had oval setups and everything is different for a road course its a lot of work but everyone is just flat out trying to get this stuff done and get us through the weekend
6680604 i cant remember another incident like this before this season then there are two in one year
6680605 yeah were going to go old school buddy ryan as they call it around here
6680606 and well come after him every snap and put a bounty in the locker room on him
6680607 its still something really hard to do to be able to tackle with that
6680608 what i miss the most is i know he can tackle but i wish he was back there returning kickoffs for us and getting through rookie mistakes
6680609 but errors are part of the game we just have to try and minimize the damage
6680610 those errors hurt but petit is such a solid infielder
6680611 i think we all just came out a bit tight knowing we needed a win to clinch the division
6680612 we were missing balls all night and then connected late in the game
6680613 i wish they would have come earlier because they were a little too late as we were already so far behind
6680614 he just got behind in the count a lot and you cant do that in a hitters park like this
6680615 we know the task in front of us and we want to finish it as soon as possible
6680616 none of these guys are superman we all have to buy into coach reggie theus system we have to play hard
6680617 a few more years and a little more mileage but still the same bobby
6680618 im not trying to get into coaching right now my main focus right now is playing
6680619 we have a group of guys who can play the game probably not the all star quality type that vlade divac and mike bibby were but they are all players that can get the job done
6680620 the first and only fantasy football video series that can be watched on all screens from the iphone and video ipod to computers televisions and game consoles
6680621 that study from the business council should ring alarm bells in every household in the country because what it means in plain language is fewer jobs higher costs and electricity higher costs on gas and higher costs right through our economy
6680622 now well be close to home our longest road trip will be an hour and 15 minutes

6680624 theyre in drought they havent had crops for a number of years and this is the first opportunity to make actually a dollar for a long time
6680625 so these people are hurting just like the farmers in south australia
6680626 people in new south wales and queensland have a water entitlement an amount of water theyre allowed to extract from the river and they choose to put that to cotton
6680627 cotton is an average water user as far as the amount of water it uses per hectare when you compare it to other crops
6680628 i just believe qantas as big as it is and its just about the 10th biggest airline in the world which is quite amazing when you consider australias the 54th biggest country but we still are not big enough in five to 10 years to do it on our own
6680629 qantas will always be australian it will always have the great majority of its jobs in australia and its business in australia but there has to be a level of maturity when it comes to a discussion on this
6680630 the airline industry is very fragmented its hugely capital intensive other airlines are starting to merge and we must be part of that
6680631 i think these things just gravitate towards people i mean your companies you tend to sit down and you see a community of interest
6680632 im not saying theres anybody out there at the moment all im saying is that many airlines are now merging in situations where they probably would not have considered it three or four even five years ago
6680633 even in a year in which the economy has been struggling our events are still attended well because companies understand more and more the importance of being found on search engines as an integral part of their marketing strategies

6680650 i find barry a good player the problems with players who are 27 28 is that you pay big money but you get nothing back no resale
6680651 at the moment the liverpool situation means he is not at his best
6680652 tottenham fans are no exception to any others they support the team and get behind the side
6680653 if a player is on form if he knocks in a couple of goals then im sure anyone who booed him last week will soon be getting behind him and cheering him that is what it is like
6680654 it is not a case of finding a solution to a problem before it occurs

6680677 a lot of these guys were in the dominican and venezuelan summer leagues they want to grow fast and a related factor is that when they get here theyre generally younger than the guys theyre competing with most of whom were drafted out of college so sometimes they look for a shortcut but there are no shortcuts

6680741 the siege that the israelis have imposed on gaza is not only illegal in terms of international law it is also immoral
6680742 global institutions and the governments of the world know what is happening and are not doing anything about it
6680743 provided documentation was in order they could sail thats the law and we cannot break it
6680744 there is this slow genocide going on in gaza and nobody is taking any notice
6680745 when the holocaust happened the whole world looked the other way while this atrocity against humanity was unfolding and it was often said we cannot allow this to happen again
6680746 the goal of our voyage is to break the illegal siege on the people of gaza as a step toward ending the israeli occupation of palestine
6680747 to remove any security pretence that israel may raise we have had our boats inspected and certified by cypriot authorities that they carry no arms or contraband of any kind

6680770 whenever theres a corrupt system then youre going to have these birds of prey descend on it to get their share of the spoils
6680771 lobbyists dont come to my office because they know theyre not going to be an earmark they know theyre not going to get a pork barrel project senator obamas gotten lots of em
6680772 i would not allow anyone who worked for my administration to go back to lobbying
6680773 everybody knew already how to get traffic so there was nothing new
6680774 its kind of nice to see faces of people that i only read online
6680775 i have conversations with these people all the time but they are faceless people its nice to have a normal conversation
6680776 the blogosphere gives everyone a voice and theres lots of great hasbara public relations we can do at a grassroots level
6680777 my approach is to try to show that israel is more than you see on cnn its actually not the scary depressing place you think it might be but its a place of vibrancy and fun and blogging is a way to spread the word about that
6680778 off a slow pace like that you cant be surprised when these girls come up on you you have to be ready to go and i didnt have it to go
6680779 coming off the curve i was actually in a pretty good position she said
6680780 it actually really opened up thats whats so disappointing i saw daylight and really went backwards instead of staying up and staying loose i got tight and that was it

6680786 i didnt have any idea what was going to be a good score out here its definitely not that easy its perfect conditions youve got great weather the course is in perfect shape right now playing in the morning helped a lot the greens were a little bit more receptive
6680787 i wanted to get that out of my system and just play golf today and i did
6680788 it was a pretty tough week but you learn from your mistakes
6680789 they took us down to the 18th tee and all of us teed off together there were all these carts down there and balls flying it was a bit surreal
6680790 instead of hitting a 7 iron on a hole the last three years now its a 5 iron
6680791 we ve had to fund additional inventory and tankage at our depots as well
6680792 we re not at liberty to mention the amounts of capital other than to say it is significant
6680793 we ll need to further invest billions of rands at our refinery to cater for low sulphur levels required by government legislation that will come into play around 2012
6680794 we ve installed approximately 800 new diesel pumps on our forecourts to make refueling easy for our diesel customers who traditionally had to go off the forecourt and fill up with the trucks
6680795 refineries have only a limited ability to produce more diesel and less petrol and therefore the pressure on diesel prices is greater
6680796 this trend started a number of years ago and was probably driven by a combination of clever marketing as well as a desire for increased fuel efficiency
6680797 the widening gap between petrol and diesel prices is primarily a result of the global economic growth that has led to demand for diesel outstripping the demand for petrol
6680798 it was at both the household level as well as within the industrial and office sectors
6680799 it would be recorded as domestic fuel sales rather than increased exports
6680800 previously diesel was not to be found at every service station probably only at 30 of our sites whereas we now install at every site as a standard grade
6680801 if access to diagnosis is universal why isnt access to drugs
6680802 the current health system is universal only in half measures if we were diagnosing the problem we would say it suffers from hemianopsia
6680803 the requirement to declare legislation unconstitutional does not mean that we are compelled to determine the anterior issue of inconsistency when owing to its wholly abstract academic or hypothetical nature it can produce no concrete or tangible result indeed none whatsoever beyond the bare declaration
6680804 we really fail to see why it must be auditors who must be ifrs specialists and not listed companies themselves
6680805 firms that decide to continue will have to remain vigilant to ensure they maintain the highest professional standards
6680806 by the time a correction is published it is usually long after the fact
6680807 surely a confirmation of the quality review annually from irba would suffice
6680808 this is resulting in more red tape and no doubt auditors will have to bear some of the costs

6680828 they cant believe their eyes things like this dont usually happen
6680829 thats good that theyre starting before the playoffs that way they can get some practice at it and it will run a little bit smoother once the playoffs start
6680830 there are so many parks where there are poles behind the fence that you cant see and it bounces around it just makes it tough for the umpires
6680831 i think they would rather get the call right especially in a playoff or world series atmosphere
6680832 its easier on the umpires and its better for the game
6680833 i guess its all going to depend if it works in your favor or not
6680834 i personally dont like it just for the fact you start bringing computers into the game
6680835 theres human error involved in both sides from players side to an umpires side nobodys perfect

6680850 there are a lot of scare cards on the turn that i can win the pot with and also at that time i thought my table image was good
6680851 with jamie in there i kind of thought i could win that hand regardless my particular table image to jamie is probably that he thinks im not putting my chips in bad so i can manipulate certain situations that i need to board permitting
6680852 i know i have to call fast because i know dicken has a piece of it
6680853 i know he doesnt have the three 9s i know hes not going to be able to overcall
6680854 i think the main lesson is to call fast so you dont get overcalled behind you
6680855 in that spot to me it was very very obvious that jamie was bluffing so i have to auto call so i dont allow the person on my left to overcall with a better hand
6680856 you have to play both players in that spot you cannot delay call in that spot because if you delay call it allows the other player to process things and hed call with two pair or something
6680857 there is so much criticism in this room that reflects how biased media are on china how little they know
6680858 people do not know much about tibet and you should ask people in beijing about tibet i have friends in tibet and their living standard has improved dramatically
6680859 it is better for you to know some things before you reach a conclusion
6680860 the media want to find something to write about but you cannot do it at a cost of sacrificing the people
6680861 we understand the essence of the russian position and its military response
6680862 including the day before georgian troops went into south ossetia we said dont do it dont be drawn into a military conflict its not in your interest
6680863 but the pressure on georgia was too great and they felt they had to act that gave russia the excuse they were looking for to launch a massive military operation with over 20 000 troops
6680864 to halt military co operation events between russia and nato countries until further instructions
6680865 we are probably still on a growth trajectory before we get to the stage when the uk presence can begin to thin out
6680866 one of the characteristics of counter insurgency unlike conventional war is the more successful you are in the short term the more troops you require
6680867 the more ground and the more people you become responsible for the more troops you need
6680868 i could use more helicopters any tactical operational commander could but there is no point in thinking that aviation is going to make a strategic difference
6680869 you make our country proud every day of the week and every week of the year
6680870 they the taliban fighters are recognised for what they are a brutal criminally orientated terrorist organisation with no interest in the afghan population
6680871 the local population is overwhelmingly hostile to the taliban the taliban is quite tactically resilient but it is not joined up at the strategic level
6680872 armies have never controlled afghanistan there has always been a political settlement
6680873 liam was seen by fai medical staff and it was decided to bring him to beaumont its purely precautionary but he is being monitored and also undergoing some tests
6680874 we have been made aware of a security breach at the offices of an external contractor involving the loss of personal information about offenders in england and wales
6680875 the data was held in a secure format on the contractors site it was downloaded on to a memory stick for processing purposes which has since been lost the transfer of data on this assignment to the external contractor has been suspended
6680876 this is a massive failure of duty what is more scandalous is that it is not the first time that the government has been shown to be completely incapable of protecting the integrity of highly sensitive data rendering them unfit to be charged with protecting our safety
6680877 it seems extraordinary that a private company should be entrusted with and then lose so much confidential data when criminal justice agencies are still unable to share computerised information between themselves
6680878 this clearly illustrates why its so important to have binding agreements between countries which will prevent sex offenders hopping from one place to another and possibly going underground where they will pose a serious threat to children
6680879 offenders like glitter can and should be chaperoned while being deported back to the uk where they can be properly monitored it is disappointing this latest development was not anticipated and proper arrangements put in place to make this work
6680880 this case is important because it highlights how easy it is for uk offenders to move around freely when they are overseas even those who pose a high risk to children

6680890 the rumor all over silicon valley is that meg wants to run for governor
6680891 she was very articulate with a very strong presence i think its safe to bet that she has political ambitions

6680894 one of the leading voices in the senate against taxing the internet
6680895 she seems genuinely connected to opportunities in the future and how they will help people on the ground
6680896 she balances a sense of urgency as a business leader with the ability to have patience as a government leader
6680897 if she were to be a part of government do i think she would be very good in that field yes i do

6681003 the minister has recently confirmed with vanoc in writing that the department of canadian heritage intends to invest 20 million toward the opening ceremony of the olympic winter games in order to ensure that the event adequately reflects the priorities of the government and helps to achieve its domestic and international branding goals
6681004 no one level of government told us which way to go
6681005 it was complete synergy there was nobody who was lobbying because what they wanted wasnt getting done
6681006 we and all canadians look forward to a memorable opening ceremony that will allow the world to see the best that canada has to offer
6681007 to ensure that the opening ceremony is truly representative of canadas cultural diversity and linguistic duality by highlighting the excellence and richness of the performances of leading canadian artists
6681008 whos the government the government is the cabinet the government is the ruling political party which is the conservative party its not the priorities of canadian people
6681009 we would be very interested to know to what level their involvement is going to be is this going to be that they have direct input into being able to override anything the creators do
6681010 theres a disturbing ambiguity in the language a lot of very very vague terms that i think have dangerous implications in terms of artistic censorship
6681011 our government wants to ensure that canadas goals are achieved through the opening ceremonies naturally we will want to be involved in the planning especially if we have invested taxpayers money
6681012 this involvement of the federal government is our very best partner helping us understand and interpret the brand we call canada to the world

6681034 using this technique we can more precisely define the fragments of the molecule and how they are oriented that allows us to define protein features and determine structure at the atomic scale
6681035 with increased speed and sensitivity we can obtain very high resolution spectra and because we can resolve thousands of signals at a time one for each atom in the sample we can determine the structure of the entire protein
6681036 in our experiments we explore couplings between atoms in proteins

6681060 the welcome home will also be a chance for the athletes to say thank you to tasmanians for their support and messages of encouragement
6681061 the details of where the welcome home celebrations will take place will be announced soon
6681062 the amount of personal effort these athletes have put into their sport is nothing short of amazing
6681063 it will be all about them what they like what they do what they wear and what issues they are facing as the youth of today
6681064 we believe this project will also offer the students invaluable real life learning experiences
6681065 when i heard about the possibility of such a project i was more than happy to jump on board
6681066 im hoping the magazine will provide a well balanced and realistic view for young people
6681067 im lucky to have such a great opportunity and share my stories with like minded people on such a large scale

6681070 from where we were early this morning hearing lots of rumours obviously its not as bad as it looked
6681071 the fact that they are investing is good news but the loss of 160 jobs is pretty devastating
6681072 we re not convinced its only going to be 160 its something well have to have some discussions on
6681073 we understand that this is a very difficult time for some of our employees
6681074 we have a long history of supporting our employees whenever we need to make changes to the business and if the proposal proceeds we will ensure every affected employee receives their full redundancy entitlements as well as comprehensive career planning and support services

6681079 whenever there is change in the market we see organisations focus more on their financials
6681080 we see extra sets of eyes looking at the books and we see that the accounting people are really central to the business
6681081 from experience the accounting industry generally doesnt feel it until 12 months later
6681082 the work required isnt as great because the transactions are smaller ive seen that happen a few times now like in the mid 90s
6681083 being overworked and stressed due to staffing issues is not a winning attraction strategy for anyone in or wanting to enter the profession
6681084 its a very big part of many employers strategies to look at their competitors and look at their staff

6681086 were really disappointed weve only been here since november and it will definitely affect if we can stay here

6681089 this pub is my life and i will not only lose my job but my home and dignity
6681090 i am expecting the worse but i will play hard to get when they arrive
6681091 these are loss making pubs which are not likely to realise any value for the creditors
6681092 we regret that staff at the loss making pubs are being made redundant but we will continue to trade the remainder of the business and are dealing with numerous parties who have contacted us expressing interest in the group
6681093 i dont think anyone else has had as tough a first two fights back in the ufc as i have and thats the way i prefer it
6681094 i want to fight the best in the world to test my skills and see how i am you win some you lose some unfortunately ive lost the last two im definitely going out there this fight with palhares to win and take nothing less than winning
6681095 well i think having lost my last two fights i definitely need to get back in there and win this one for sure i think wanderlei silva was in a similar situation except for hed lost three in a row but again the three that he lost were against three top guys then they put him against jardine and he was kind of with his back to the wall and he went out there and took care of business so i guess i got to follow his lead
6681096 you know im one of those guys i dont need to focus on the fight all the time and its actually better for me to have distractions
6681097 the elevation was kind of nice but i didnt notice a huge benefit off that i dont know my body felt a little weird that night when i fought anderson silva
6681098 i didnt quite do the weight cut as i was planning i overshot it by three pounds
6681099 thats my own fault i normally like to lose five or six pounds at weigh ins i was eight pounds over and i ended up losing 11 it came off a little bit too easy but again its just not good to do and who knows that could have been a reason or could have been just not a good night for me in general
6681100 i think this is a good match up for me
6681101 im going to be the guy thats a lot more dangerous on my feet and its somewhere he doesnt want to be with me so its going to be his task to get me into his world on the ground im not the easiest guy to take down you know so the determining factor of the fight is who can defend takedowns who can get their takedown and if i can knock him out coming in or whatever
6681102 i try to come up with a game plan not to fight right in the guys strengths so obviously im going to be trying to stay up on my feet with him
6681103 i was pretty pissed at my last performance and im probably going to be a little bit pissed when i go out there and fight this guy im ready to do a 15 minute grappling match with him if i have to but im not going to lose

6681122 the offense has moved the ball well in the last two games against two good defenses
6681123 theres not many people in this league that can run with vernon
6681124 i got sacked once and on that one i probably could have thrown the ball away
6681125 some good some bad im getting a better grasp of the offense each week each practice we had great blocking especially when youre playing a front like that thats where it all starts
6681126 an area that was the strength of our team last year has had problems the last two weeks
6681127 we have a high powered offense under coordinator mike martz as long as you do what youre supposed to do were going to move the ball
6681128 but when i got elected to the executive board of the players association i told gene i need you to be the player rep
6681129 because i saw those qualities that other people hadnt seen i knew right away that gene had the leadership and qualities to be a leader on and off the football field thats why we picked him as one of the captains of the team
6681130 gene was a great player he was an all pro he was a hall of famer if you look at the history of the nfl youre going to find out that he was one of the most influential people that the league has known he did so much not only for the players but also for the owners the teams and the game of pro football
6681131 when i think about gene upshaw i think about no 63 pulling
6681132 a lot of people called it highway 63 thats what i remember and i know about gene because when he pulled around that left side he got in like a hurricane coming through wiped out everything that was there
6681133 gene was tough he just felt he couldnt get beat he had the determination to be the very best and when we drafted him mr davis knew that he would be the very best
6681134 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6681135 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6681136 a guy like delamielleure says the things he said about me you think im going to invite him to dinner no im going to break his damn neck
6681137 the reality of life for all the guys who played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span its just the way it is
6681138 i have sympathy for his family i have sympathy for his wife and children i didnt know gene personally i just knew him professionally
6681139 in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but he didnt always do so
6681140 he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game in the big picture
6681141 the raider organization the national football league and the world have lost a great man gene upshaws career successes as a professional football player and a union leader are unparalleled he is as prominent a sportsman as the world has known he was and will remain a part of the fabric of our lives and of the raider mystique and legacy we loved him and he loved us we will miss him our hearts go out to terri and the boys

6681146 def jam doesnt fund rihanna properly so marc uses the money rihanna makes from third party endorsements and from tours to fund her album and music videos i dont want to disrespect marcs name he is a fantastic manager and genuinely believes in rihanna but he uses her money to fund her future projects because he believes he can break her in the world market

6681149 everything is directed by pakistan everybody knows that this is a fact because the big commanders of the taliban are in quetta
6681150 that means the army will also be watching the home front and less inclined to climb into the mountains and fight the taliban to do us a favour

6681166 you should come to practice some day hear how loud it is how off the wall it is its at a point sometimes where its almost out of control its almost annoying you dont want to squelch the fun but at times its almost become a distraction
6681167 its good to be loose during the week yesterday wednesday they were very serious at practice everybody getting their work done now is that because im an ogre at practice and taking all the fun out or maybe they got my message the day before that theres a time to goof and theres a time to be serious
6681168 thats the way they looked in the first calgary game won 28 18 by the stampeders and they paid a price for it and more than just on the scoreboard that score was very flattering to the b c lions hopefully itll settle itself down and if it does things will work out
6681169 the defensive backs shouldnt be trying to cheat on the routes
6681170 the qb and the receivers shouldnt try to do more than theyre supposed to its not a negative aspect its an aspect of guys trying to do too much just do what is expected and if thats not good enough then im willing to take the blame for that thats what i told them
6681171 ontario much more than canada has more stagflation it has the weakest growth and among the highest inflation rates

6681186 they face a very very difficult challenge here and its very important that they have stepped forward and accepted responsibility
6681187 they have chosen to protect their brand rather than protecting their legal liability this is correct they can deal with legal issues later after theyve rescued the brand
6681188 they must communicate with those affected immediately and without delay
6681189 crisis management should never be delegated to a legal department or corporate council
6681190 it doesnt happen often enough its a courageous thing to do to go out and be public about it like that
6681191 they are doing the right thing to protect their brand over the long term but it does mean taking a short term hit to do that

6681202 that mi5 continued to facilitate the interviewing of bm by providing information and questions after 17 may 2002 in the knowledge of what was reported to them as to the circumstances of his detention and treatment in pakistan
6681203 by seeking to interview bm in the circumstances found in pakistan and supplying information and questions for his interviews the relationship between the united kingdom and the united states authorities was far beyond that of a bystander or witness to the alleged wrongdoing
6681204 the court has no doubt that on the basis of that information the security service were right to conclude that bm was a person of great potential significance and a serious potential threat to the national security of the united kingdom

6681230 that was really the only suspicious thing about the letter and our national headquarters advised out of an abundance of caution for our staff and volunteers that we have the authorities check it out
6681231 i guess if you think that being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong

6681240 our draft resolution is a reconfirmation of the six point agreement and theres no territorial integrity in the six principles
6681241 we believe the six principles are clear and already implemented
6681242 what we see on the ground is the result of ambiguity
6681243 we have a presence of so called russian peacekeeping forces at key georgian choke points that will control economic life it will control humanitarian activities thats why clarifications are so important

6681249 as the technical trading and administrative center of the worldwide industry
6681250 more important than gold and diamonds are people this critical resource more than anything accounts for houstons headlong drive toward becoming not only the leading city of texas and the south but also a player on the global scene it is emerging as one of the worlds great cities
6681251 the unpolished american b movie worked out by a few people with belief and skill in their art who capture the unworked over immediacy of life before it has been cooled by art
6681252 those tiny mysterious interactions between the actor and the scene that make up the memorable moments in any good film
6681253 such tingling moments liberate the imagination of both actors and audiences they are simply curiosity flexing itself spoofing making connections to a new situation
6681254 you were born in roosevelt new york thats an exciting town i worked as a carpenter there
6681255 not so long ago the movies whatever their simplifications and distortions still rested on the assumption that their function was to present some intelligible structured image of reality on the simplest level to tell a story and to entertain but more generally to extend the spectators meaningful experience to offer him a window on the real world
6681256 what are they now icebergs of a sort they take things that dont belong together charge them up with hidden meanings and then unite them in a juxtaposition that is bound to shock the spectator into a lubricated state of mind where he is forced to think seriously about the phony implications of what he is seeing
6681257 his legacy includes a school of estranged clown fish intellectual ineffectuals a vivid communication of mucking about a good eye for damp villas in the suburbs an ability to turn any actress into a doll part of the decor some great still shots that have an irascible energy an endless supply of lists
6681258 i think that i shall never see scenes with more sleep provoking powers or hear so many big words that tell me nothing or be an audience to film writing which gets to the heart of an idea and hangs in there or be so edified by the sound and sight of decent noble words spoken with utter piety
6681259 the common gripe of theatre technicians is that we put in twice the amount of work for half the amount of pay as compared to our colleagues in front of the curtain
6681260 youve got the actors directors and scriptwriters and then set lighting and sound designers and then theyll probably need one or two crew members that will do a lot of things for peanuts
6681261 in general singapore has become more expensive from salaries to transport and its not like we have a safe income in this industry
6681262 with the tightening of budgets the first to suffer would be the technical staff with the reduction of fees
6681263 its a good start but i dont see anything coming out of it initially there were a lot of courses but now its kind of quieted down
6681264 sound design for theatre used to be two dog barks and one door slam and the kind of interaction well have with the director is theyll say that the bark is too loud or the light too bright
6681265 the guy who comes in and turns on the sound
6681266 when i go to schools to do shows there are only a handful of students willing to learn and do hands on stuff

6681272 radio listenership is actually declining faster than analysts investors and journalists thought
6681273 too many of us have for too long kidded ourselves that the radio sector was is or is soon to be poised for a marked upturn
6681274 why should the plunge radio stocks have taken over the last 30 months reverse itself when the industrys prospects havent brightened sufficiently
6681275 all the trends are weak to disappointing if not downright depressing and this is from an analyst whose family has been in radio for 50 years
6681276 radio listenership is actually declining faster than analysts investors and journalists thought
6681277 the iphone 2 0 2 software update improves communication with 3g networks
6681278 the kicker is it does show three bars of 3g instead of one with 2 0 1 so it looks like they just changed the way the bars look with this update now thats useful
6681279 my new iphone 3g i almost threw it out my car window today it dropped 12 calls within four hours in downtown houston that is crazy
6681280 i live in the centre of the u k s second largest city and my 3g reception is intermittent between five bars and zero therefore the connection keeps getting stuck
6681281 and this is after upgrading to 2 0 2 terrible
6681282 wow an acknowledgment by apple of the 3g defect with some of the iphone 3gs well kind of sort of maybe a little bit if you read between the lines
6681283 i suppose that adding in some modicum of connectivity for the new countries scheduled for iphone release on friday could be construed as improved communication with 3g networks

6681293 republicans have become so obsessed with the notion that we can drill our way out of our energy crisis that re opening our coastal waters to offshore drilling has become their answer for every energy question
6681294 citizens have an expectation that the state will collect revenue in an efficient and timely manner
6681295 we identified eight best practices that greatly improve collection success
6681296 we made recommendations to five agencies that mirror best practices and in most cases can be instituted with no additional resources
6681297 if the eight programs reduce their delinquent account balances by a modest 5 percent the state will collect approximately 15 6 million more per year if they reduce delinquent account balances by 50 percent they can collect an additional 159 7 million
6681298 dont get pushy cant come in right now really have to leave now please turn right around and leave now
6681299 perhaps if the professionally inquiring blonds camera gets set up here and then the professionally inquiring blonds light focused over there to shine over there by the demonstrations dudes large conference table
6681300 what does the brassy blond want with the demonstrations dude here now
6681301 why where did the brassy blond get the demonstrations dudes brassy little balls
6681302 as the demonstrations dude stated by this inquisitive blonds phono interplay connection yesterday the demonstrations dude could explain the purpose of the demonstrations dudes brassy little balls
6681303 yes this professionally inquiring blond s full publication of the demonstrations dudes use of these brassy little balls will be made to
6681304 go right ahead please go right ahead and have the camera crew the brassy blond has brought go right ahead and set up this professionally inquiring blonds inquisitive equipment that this brassy blonds camera crew has brought
6681305 yes yes must help this professionally inquiring blond get to this professionally inquiring blonds big bottom line with respect to this brassy blonds hand held little brassy balls right here right away
6681306 please dont touch this professionally inquiring blonds hand held brassy little balls
6681307 but of course the brassy blond doesnt expect the demonstrations dude to judge the caliber of this professionally inquiring blonds hand held brassy little balls without even touching this professionally inquiring blonds brassy little balls does the brassy blond
6681308 but the go for assistant has to keep the go for assistants gopher like eyes close eyeingly on what the demonstrations dude does with this professionally inquiring blonds brassy little balls when the demonstrations dude has this professionally inquiring blonds brassy little balls in the demonstrations dudes large gripping hands
6681309 lets wait till the camera man and the lighting specialist have completely set up
6681310 and then the demonstrations dude can sit here for this inquisitive blonds interview facing this inquisitive blonds camera and this oval faced blond will sit here with this inquisitive blonds camera behind the oval faced blond
6681311 so that the oval faced blond can ask this inquisitive blonds questions
6681312 when were this inquisitive blonds brassy little balls used on this oval faced blond
6681313 what makes the demonstrations dude think this inquisitive blonds brassy little balls were used on this brassy blond
6681314 dont remember stating to the demonstrations dude anything of that nature
6681315 just noticing the fact that the oval faced blonds neatly accoutremental attire shows the oval faced blond has the appropriately large physical dimensionalities for this inquisitive blonds brassy little balls to exude a maximum effectiveness
6681316 because the go for assistant has the go for assistants many functional attributes that may begin to quickly apply right here right now
6681317 does nothing but anger the brassy blond s big buttcheeks soft assflesh
6681318 lights all set but not necessary for the camera ambient lights real bright from every angle in this lab all white all bright enough
6681319 the demonstrations dudes open palmed rubbing the brassy blonds skirt covered assand the oval faced blonds just standing still for the massaging
6681320 got any clue to what the oval faced blonds up to here
6681321 better go tell the brassy blond the set ups in place for the interview to begin
6681322 though the oval faced blond may not care too much right now no mo about this interview at all
6681323 sure looks like the oval faced blond wants to bend down an get on all fours on this stark labs polished up floor for the demonstrations dude
6681324 whens the last time the camera man saw the oval faced blond get all assy readied up like that
6681325 gonna get beside the widely round eyed blond where the brassy blond stands now and do a pan around to get a good focus on the widely round eyed blonds really sensual looking face and another good focus on the widely round eyed blonds obviously sexually responsive blue skirted asscheeks
6681326 dont talk about what the camera man should already be doing
6681327 the lighting stands not necessary for the camera ambient lights real bright from every angle in this lab all white all bright enough so go get beside the brassy blond get profile shots get face shots get big behind shots get the shots looking down from above the brassy blond and get the shots looking up from below the brassy blond should be doing that already
6681328 must the brassy blond get down to brass tacks with the demonstrations dude already right now
6681329 unless of course the oval faced blond wants to just stand there getting the oval faced blonds blue skirt covered assmoundshand massaged by the demonstrations dudes rather mobile handss big hamhock palms
6681330 see how the demonstrations dude fully right hand grips the widely round eyed blonds right asscheeks blue skirt covered shapeand then lift shakes and lift shakes the widely round eyed blonds blue skirt covered assup and down and up and down
6681331 maybe the brassy blonds not yet ready to get down to brass tacks with the demonstrations dude right now
6681332 is everything really all ready standing ready for this interview to begin
6681333 everything is all ready already standing ready for the widely round eyed blonds inquisitive interviewing technique to start working
6681334 for future reference thatd be some real good knowledge for the lighting specialist to have in hand
6681335 right demonstrations dude 56 right then go ahead and demonstrate
6681336 go ahead and show the lighting specialist just how the demonstrations dude gets the brassy blond so assily cooperating with the demonstrations dude
6681337 cant right now cant show the lighting specialist right now right here because the demonstrations dudes doing the handling of the widely round eyed blonds blue skirt covered assright now
6681338 cause got a walk through through dressing room set once of twice and saw but never noticed before how really great shaped the brassy blonds asscheekss ass shape is been noticing for several days now though
6681339 thats cause the first brassy balls created the brassy blonds asscheek skin poress new ability to exude aphrodisiacal effluentss influence
6681340 so now what happens to what the brassy blond eats
6681341 the ingested food is not digested instead the ingested food is mostly divested of all matter energy connections and the remaining matter energy is then rendered into micro scopic dust clouds these micro clouds form in the brassy blonds stomach and then disperse directly from the brassy blonds stomach way up into the stratosphere then hone in on a small american town and mix in with the rainfall hardly noticeable even to scientifically exact instruments
6681342 anything meat vegetables bamboo nails horses cows entire herds an entire town dead bodies doesnt matter what is all matter energy concoctions
6681343 what happened to the rest of the oval faced blonds intestines
6681344 all of the oval faced blonds intestines were ruggedly rolled up upwardly into convoluted folds that convoluted tightly to form one very thick skinned entry sleeve
6681345 no no when the oval faced blond got first brassy balled or more correctly when the oval faced blond then got first assfucked
6681346 no no when the oval faced blond got first assfucked that first assfucking was a very painful torture assfucking
6681347 yes but the oval faced blond would have been begging for the raping because the brassy little balls would have made sure of that
6681348 sure would like to take a camera view all the way into the oval faced blonds ass tunnel
6681349 no problem thisll hold the oval faced blonds ass tunnel wide open
6681350 hey the brassy blonds entire ass tunnels one long straight shoot in
6681351 hey the brassy blonds entire ass tunnels pulsing real fast and spasmodically
6681352 hey the brassy blonds entire ass tunnels secreting really thick white stuff spasmodically
6681353 hey the brassy blonds ass tunnels pulsing real fast and spasmodically
6681354 hey the brassy blonds ass tunnel ends in a tight little ovaluar ring
6681355 hey the brassy blonds ass tunnels tight little ovaluar ring beats like a heart
6681356 so can leave the brassy blond like this and not use any of the other little balls options

6681388 a difference is that most mdsd people assume that youll want to generate code from that model rather than executing the model directly
6681389 in order to use model oriented dsls you need a different
6681390 dsls seem to have a proportionately higher emphasis in the mdsd world than they do in the mainstream programming world
6681391 a particularly visible sub community of mdsd is centered around modeldrivenarchitecture mda im not much of a fan of mda in particular
6681392 model driven software development mdsd considers itself as an alternative to the traditional style of programming
6681393 most fans of mdsd base their enthusiasm on the basis that models are ipso facto a higher level abstraction than programming languages

6681400 the mccain campaign continues to level dishonest attacks on barack obamas integrity and patriotism
6681401 mislead the american people in order to obscure his own record of failed policy judgments
6681402 he and his neoconservative foreign policy types that he agreed with are one of the reasons that george w bush decided to go to iraq
6681403 im sure he mccain loves his country its just that loving your country and lying to the american people are apparently not inconsistent in his view
6681404 richard clarke mccain pushed for war in iraq before bush did
6681405 the improved security in iraq allows us to have conversations with the iraqis about setting goals for more american troops to come home and for the iraqis to take the lead in more combat missions

6681432 i got nothing so here is a picture of my kid again
6681433 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
6681434 we were ready for this test and it was a test
6681435 they played a great game even when we werent making our shots they seemed to be making everything we never got rattled we stayed poised and our defense really led us through this
6681436 i think the leukemia taught me to think step by step
6681437 when youre laying in the hospital bed and feeling so much pain and feeling so tired you dont want to think about next week or next month youre only thinking about the next hour
6681438 you just be patient you lay in your bed and just wait its almost the same strategy ive used here to stay in the pack to be patient and stay easy just waiting for your chance
6681439 i want to dedicate my victory today to all the victims and all the families of the victims in the flight in madrid yesterday and send them all of my support and everything of me that i can help for them
6681440 it is my hometown and when this thing happened i felt so bad yesterday and today
6681441 if theres a team that can rebound from something like this its team penske
6681442 theyve done it before and were going to do it again its tough because you have some small bits seats for example i loved the seat that i had and im going to have to use the spare one little details
6681443 we have prepared four bases for the new national coalition government we have finalized the cmp the code of conduct for ministers the norms and methods of operation of government and the formation of a political coordination committee
6681444 the cabinet portfolio allocation is also being finalized we will possibly form the cabinet on friday
6681445 one of the teachers called some indian students derogatory names
6681446 my 10 year old son was lifted up by the ears by a male teacher and slapped and kicked for talking before entering the classroom after recess in february
6681447 these are young impressionable children and the alleged incidents will only teach them to hate
6681448 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
6681449 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
6681450 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6681451 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6681452 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6681453 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
6681454 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6681455 the chinese government and the chinese athletes must be respected
6681456 for the time being there is nothing i can add
6681457 if you trust every web site but not a government there are so many web sites so much hearsay
6681458 these are not official it is possible that all news on the internet is accurate
6681459 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
6681460 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
6681461 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
6681462 so we have sent a letter to the ioc and to the international federation asking them to review the matter and see if they cant resolve it for the good of the competition the integrity of the competition and the good of all the athletes
6681463 fair play is an important aspect of the olympic movement and the ioc is responsible for ensuring that everybody is playing by the rules this issue needs to be resolved and it needs to be behind us once the ioc feels it has done everything in its power to resolve it everyone is going to have to accept that at some level
6681464 there have been questions that have been on the table and discrepancies that have been alluded to by certain parties
6681465 the ioc is simply wanting to do its due diligence to 100 percent clarify the situation and put this to rest
6681466 oh you like my couch i got it for 125 from a vintage shop my dining room chairs theyre from a 1920s carnegie library i got 11 of them for 75
6681467 ask yourself why you like it that traditional way because youve seen it like that so much in the commercials
6681468 maybe im radical in my thinking heh but i personally dont like to own anything that i cant move by myself and in a hurry
6681469 why not open your highly creative mind a bit and truly create your own design of a
6681470 i am sorry that you feel the need to view my living room as
6681471 use it up wear it out make it do or do without
6681472 sommige delen van mijn leven hou ik voor mezelf ik probeer me te ontspannen met mijn vrienden en zij zijn de enigen die echt het antwoord op die vraag kennen
6681473 these things happen in hollywood and fairy tales they dont usually happen to me with my family or my life i still cant believe it
6681474 it was the wrong decision and anybody who knows anything about the game knows that
6681475 but one gold medal helps take away all the pain in a way im glad i went through it because i learned a lot about myself and my close friends and family
6681476 i asked the players two questions do you want to win yes do you need goalkeepers to win yes we needed to get past it and on this day you can see we did
6681477 i have no idea why we cant win a final
6681478 its something im going to keep asking myself for a long time you keep asking what you did wrong im more mad than sad again we had a chance to win the gold and again we let it slip away we lost focus when we conceded the goal we always play well during the tournaments but in the finals we cant score its hard to say why that keeps happening to us
6681479 we can look back and kick ourselves for the things we didnt do
6681480 but youve got to give them credit for the things they did do
6681481 its important for them to see the game because a lot of times they dont see a lot of softball
6681482 our work that we need to be doing among a number of things is to educate ioc members about our sport because there are a number of countries where our sport is not being played or its not popular
6681483 weve got to find ways to make sure that they see our sport at the really competitive side
6681484 los trabajadores cuentan con todas las medidas de seguridad y son formados durante un mes para poder elaborar su trabajo si bien muchos de ellos ya presentaban conocimientos de jardiner a

6681486 its important that glitter comes back here and that hes carefully risk assessed here in the u s where we can do that
6681487 its important that we stop him traveling overseas again where he is a known risk of abusing children
6681488 the water has covered the beach there isnt really any beach left at all
6681489 we havent been out since tuesday because of the bad driving
6681490 it was hard to see because of all of the rain but we have plenty of canned food
6681491 as far as we know we cant leave our condominiums to get to highway a1a because the police are blocking it
6681492 im up here im not unfortunate i can cook a hamburger ive got power i feel very blessed
6681493 wreckage was strewn for about a mile down the beach
6681494 ok well get rid of the fornication but keep the fertility symbols because what could that hurt as long as their worshipping and celebrating christ and god
6681495 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 meters
6681496 he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6681497 i would love him to show more respect for his competitors
6681498 to me i dont feel like hes being disrespectful if this guy has worked his tail off every day on his knees throwing up like i was in practice he deserves to dance
6681499 we got three medals out of six thats pretty damn good
6681500 everything was just kind of clicking i had a great start silver im psyched
6681501 this report from wisdom study is reassuring that there are real benefits for some women electing to use hrt
6681502 while it has been well established that quality of life measures are improved in younger symptomatic women this paper adds some information that even older women may benefit
6681503 while some of this information was reported from the whi which used the same hormonal regimen more sensitive instruments were used in wisdom which was able to show improvements in other measures such as sexual function
6681504 while this is important information and is reassuring regarding the benefits of hrt these findings in isolation are not an indication to initiate hormones in asymptomatic older women for the first time
6681505 it shows that hrt can offer real benefits to most women experiencing menopausal symptoms our advice remains the same each woman is an individual and she needs to discuss whats right for her with her doctor in the light of her medical history
6681506 weve received some information which puts the matter to rest
6681507 if the gymnasts hadnt been cleared they wouldnt have participated in the games
6681508 u s a gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the international gymnastics federation and ioc
6681509 an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition
6681510 i got involved because i wanted to be part of something new and different
6681511 you have one of the best players in the world in ginobili the ultimate competitor

6681514 people in the age group of 25 to 50 are most at risk the neurons that tell people in the crucial age range not to over eat are being killed off
6681515 when the stomach is empty it triggers the ghrelin hormone that notifies the brain that we are hungry when we are full a set of neurons known as pomcs kick in
6681516 however free radicals created naturally in the body attack the pomc neurons this process causes the neurons to degenerate overtime affecting our judgement as to when our hunger is satisfied
6681517 information from this study could be the beginning of a systematic approach to develop a method of predicting pain threshold and morphine requirement for pain relief
6681518 it is fascinating to observe how individual proteins can determine addictive behavioural patterns
6681519 its just been one thing after the other at this olympics

6681522 within 15 minutes i was ok i didnt even get hurt much
6681523 prescription sleeping pills can be important in certain situations but they can cause a lot of adverse effects and are not a long term solution for older people sleep medication can increase the risk of falling as well as interfering with other medicines
6681524 sleeping pills are not the best way to solve underlying problems like depression or painful conditions that are interfering with a good nights sleep
6681525 but if you stop being physical you stop giving yourself a chance to play because it is going to be a physical game

6681558 the unpolished american b movie worked out by a few people with belief and skill in their art who capture the unworked over immediacy of life before it has been cooled by art
6681559 those tiny mysterious interactions between the actor and the scene that make up the memorable moments in any good film
6681560 such tingling moments liberate the imagination of both actors and audiences they are simply curiosity flexing itself spoofing making connections to a new situation
6681561 you were born in roosevelt new york thats an exciting town i worked as a carpenter there
6681562 not so long ago the movies whatever their simplifications and distortions still rested on the assumption that their function was to present some intelligible structured image of reality on the simplest level to tell a story and to entertain but more generally to extend the spectators meaningful experience to offer him a window on the real world
6681563 what are they now icebergs of a sort they take things that dont belong together charge them up with hidden meanings and then unite them in a juxtaposition that is bound to shock the spectator into a lubricated state of mind where he is forced to think seriously about the phony implications of what he is seeing
6681564 his legacy includes a school of estranged clown fish intellectual ineffectuals a vivid communication of mucking about a good eye for damp villas in the suburbs an ability to turn any actress into a doll part of the decor some great still shots that have an irascible energy an endless supply of lists
6681565 i think that i shall never see scenes with more sleep provoking powers or hear so many big words that tell me nothing or be an audience to film writing which gets to the heart of an idea and hangs in there or be so edified by the sound and sight of decent noble words spoken with utter piety

6681586 while child welfare services had improved an immigration removal centre can never be a suitable place for children and we were dismayed to find cases of disabled children being detained and some children spending large amounts of time incarcerated
6681587 any period of detention can be detrimental to children and their families but the impact of lengthy detention is particularly extreme
6681588 which was not surprising given the sometimes traumatic circumstances in which many had initially been detained
6681589 we found examples in the recent past of children with disabilities who ought not to have been detained

6681609 were never happy to lose but i think its interesting because everybody talked about how we win all the time and that nobody can compete and this just proves that teams can
6681610 i really got to tip my hat to yukiko ueno
6681611 i mean she pitched a hell of a lot the past two days and they beat us
6681612 weve faced her so many times and we were confident
6681613 she came right at us i didnt expect it two days in a row
6681614 i dont think any of us can look back on any one thing and have regrets

6681617 the government will acquire another 600 acres in future for the next phases
6681618 in the first half we werent knocking down shots but we were playing great defense and that was what allowed us to stay in the game
6681619 coach said that defense was the difference between today and two years ago
6681620 two years ago we had the same thing where we couldnt score but then we couldnt keep them from scoring but this year we found a way to play as a unit and get those stops
6681621 we always talk about offensively we are going to find a way to score enough points to win
6681622 look at the firepower we have for us our goal is to hold the other team under 60 points this russia is a team coming in so prolific on the offensive end coach said going in that she thought our defense was going to win the game for us and it came true
6681623 its not a surprise anymore when he goes out there and pitches like that
6681624 you dont become a champion without being mentally and physically tough and you know what i showed up and got it done
6681625 i said nothing is going to get in my way i said before the race this is my domain and im going to get it done
6681626 i ran the best i could i just didnt have anything at the end im disappointed it happens its a long season i started back in february its now august the body can only take so much
6681627 that was the only thing i could think of and it got me the bronze it was a last second decision i had to go for it
6681628 menengai forest is a dangerous place to send children because of the crater
6681629 when a situation is as grave as it is here at the camp the most vulnerable people are women and children that is why you find many bad things happening to them
6681630 you might want to engage in sex for the sake of your children but what do you do when only a thin piece of canvas separates your side of the tent from your neighbours

6681636 he threw a kick and i threw a kick and in my humble opinion i thought it should have been 1 1
6681637 but i respect the judges decision in giving him a point and not me its a subjective sport
6681638 i think the leukemia taught me to think step by step
6681639 when youre laying in the hospital bed and feeling so much pain and feeling so tired you just wait its almost the same strategy ive used here to stay in the pack to be patient and stay easy just waiting for your chance
6681640 i didnt have any idea what was going to be a good score out here its definitely not that easy its perfect conditions youve got great weather the course is in perfect shape right now playing in the morning helped a lot the greens were a little bit more receptive
6681641 i wanted to get that out of my system and just play golf today and i did
6681642 it was a pretty tough week but you learn from your mistakes
6681643 the greens are good i mean theyre perfect perfect speed
6681644 i think you can be aggressive i was committed to my lines and made aggressive strokes
6681645 i thought the scores werent going to be as low
6681646 hunter had such a great round and there were some 4 or 5 under par rounds so my 1 under par round is not as good as i thought it would be but i thought i played well and ill take it
6681647 i know its difficult out there and the rough is tough but that was just bad play
6681648 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6681649 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6681650 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6681651 if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6681652 i was not expecting anything like this i thought it was going to be a few girls from the gym and coaches
6681653 it got me pretty square then i had to go toward first base but i had to get the out as bad as it hurt i just went after it and was able to make the play
6681654 when we came inside i said im going to take my shirt off and give everybody high fives
6681655 ive got a lot of confidence especially with the guys hitting out there and playing defense behind me the way they are
6681656 ive been able to get down in the zone low and get a lot of ground balls and strikeouts
6681657 i think if one gold medal takes away all the pain in the world thats fake
6681658 i think i needed that growing process i needed that 10 months and i got rid of that pain on my own or with my family and my friends
6681659 you have experiences that help you to better yourself you go through them and i felt stronger in the end and i know its cliche but im happy i went through it i found out a lot about myself and a lot about my family and friends and teammates
6681660 this medal has nothing to do with whether or not healing has taken place healing had to take place in my own heart and my own mind to even get this far with that said with the team winning a gold medal im on top of the world im on cloud nine
6681661 that first game 2 0 loss norway i had a lot of nerves and i was disappointed in myself when im nervous i dont play my best it got better with each game and that last game tonight nothing no nerves were inside at all it was all confidence
6681662 you train to put yourself in that position and whichever way it happens thats the way it is
6681663 you cant pick and choose which times you come out on top if you could wed have three olympic gold medals
6681664 youre going to come down to a game where youre elated or heartbroken
6681665 i wouldnt have it any other way thats why you play
6681666 its up there with the great performances of all time it would have to be in the olympic finals
6681667 you win the silver medal but youre the team that lost
6681668 you have 10 minutes to digest that and you have to put up a pretty face its hard
6681669 its a dream come true to be a starter in the pac 10 so ive got to take advantage of it
6681670 we feel like both of them have had great camps kevin will take the first snaps and well see where we go from there
6681671 were confident in both of them but we want to see the roles reversed and how that works were looking for the best chance to be successful
6681672 its an honor to be named the starter especially after what nate has done at cal
6681673 i feel like seawright has a great upside with his leg strength once he got his bearings hes been very consistent and gives us a little more range
6681674 we probably wont know the starters until game time when we see what the game plan will be
6681675 there will probably be a broader rotation than weve ever had with the receivers
6681676 a couple of years ago i was able to buy everything practically new
6681677 you just have to do some things different to adjust
6681678 weve seen an increase in terms of clothes school supplies broken in sports gear its a great way to get brand name styles for cheaper
6681679 its not just the working poor were also seeing more middle class families coming to us
6681680 parents would go naked before they would send their kids to school without the right tools to be able to get an education
6681681 you dont want a child to feel embarrassed or left out
6681682 thats not a good way to start the school year
6681683 gas alone is making me rethink a whole lot of things it looks like well have to do fewer projects or just come up with another creative way to do them
6681684 she said she cant have a regular calculator it has to have different functions on it
6681685 you make sure that the teacher understands whats going on so they dont penalize them
6681686 i know for a fact people like me are going to have a hard time
6681687 but i think i showed i can play it was awesome to play at soldier field
6681688 its one of those things where if it works you get praised for it
6681689 and if it doesnt you dont you look like the dumb rookie
6681690 the coaches gave me their talks about how it wasnt such a good idea to go then and there
6681691 pretty much telling me i need to be on second base i remember on the first pitch i didnt go and he kind of gave me that fatherly what are you doing look
6681692 he told me to get a good walking lead and stay on my toes you never know whats going to happen
6681693 question him putting me in the game thats why hes a players manager hes going to give you that leash to hang yourself with and hes also going to give you that chance to redeem yourself
6681694 i owe a lot to bruce and i appreciate what hes done for me this year id pitch him for any time anywhere
6681695 i like all fans of team usa am extremely disappointed with the performance of our relays today
6681696 once the games are complete we will be conducting a comprehensive review of our program the review will include assessments from inside and outside the usatf family included in this assessment will be the way in which we select train and coach our relays
6681697 people say if it hits your hand you should have it im a veteran ive never dropped the stick in my life its upsetting
6681698 its my job to get the guy the baton i did not do that
6681699 i thought he had it i let it go and he dropped it
6681700 he was and will remain a part of the fabric of our lives and of the raider mystique and legacy we loved him and he loved us we will miss him
6681701 gene was a true pioneer as one of the few african american leaders of a major union
6681702 gene was a great player he was an all pro he was a hall of famer he was one of the most influential people that the league has known he did so much not only for the players but also for the owners the teams and the game of pro football
6681703 few people in the history of the national football league have played the game as well as gene and then had another career in football with so much positive impact on the structure and competitiveness of the entire league as gene
6681704 i think he was a good guy you dont always have to agree with everything somebody does to respect them
6681705 after his long career as a player he dedicated his efforts to tirelessly working to improve the salaries benefits and working conditions of generations of nfl players we talked often about common issues and i will miss those conversations
6681706 you wont find a better person in terms of taking care of former players than gene upshaw gene would do whatever is best for the players you hear all the older players who gripe and complain that we should have better this or better that they wouldnt have what they have today if not for gene upshaw
6681707 gene and i developed a close friendship that remained strong through the good times and some of the nfls most difficult challenges we worked very closely on key issues that allowed the nfl to maintain unprecedented labor peace his biggest asset was his understanding of the business of the game and you always knew that his concern for the games best interests guided his actions
6681708 with genes passing the nfl has lost an innovator players have lost their advocate and i have lost a friend a hall of fame player gene was also a hall of fame businessman and negotiator he always had the best interests of the nfl players at heart and that played a large role in building our league to the prominence it enjoys today
6681709 he was a giant in the nfl since entering the league in 1967 first as a hall of fame offensive lineman then as an active member of the collective bargaining process in the late 1970s and early 1980s and finally as executive director of the nflpa gene continually served in the best interests of the game of football he played a colossal role in the success the nfl enjoys today even more than many people realize
6681710 he was a true gentleman and his contributions to our great game first as high character highly skilled player and later as the head of the players union will never be forgotten
6681711 i could tell from the beginning it was a fast heat
6681712 i was happy about that made sure it was an honest race i went to the lead because it felt right got a little tired at the end its a good learning experience the more i learn the better racer ill be
6681713 it is really great to get it the semifinal out of the way its good to get those nerves out of the way and get to the final and compete it was good to see how i compare against an international field of women
6681714 i hope people wake up and emotionally engage in issues
6681715 everyone is great and she is a healthy beautiful baby girl
6681716 i hope people wake up and emotionally engage in issues
6681717 yes i work out and take care of myself but i also like a cold beer once in a while
6681718 because it is too expensive to go to the salon
6681719 i was extremely nervous because as olympic champion i have to come out and compete everyone from jamaica was running fast i had to do my part
6681720 i think you can imagine how i feel pretty devastated
6681721 i knew i should have been stronger i saw her campbell brown cruise right by me i expected more from myself
6681722 the main thing was to get away from her felix and the rest of the field
6681723 i was confident about how things would go i love china and liu xiang is my friend i know he is very big in china
6681724 the offense has moved the ball well in the last two games against two good defenses
6681725 theres not many people in this league that can run with vernon
6681726 i got sacked once and on that one i probably could have thrown the ball away
6681727 some good some bad im getting a better grasp of the offense each week each practice we had great blocking especially when youre playing a front like that thats where it all starts
6681728 an area that was the strength of our team last year has had problems the last two weeks
6681729 we have a high powered offense under coordinator mike martz as long as you do what youre supposed to do were going to move the ball
6681730 listen the performance lately has been a little rougher than anyone would like to go through
6681731 but we didnt make any bones about what we were going to do when we said we were going to go through a rebuilding
6681732 for people who watch the team on a day to day basis that might seem like a long way away but our goal first and foremost was to rebuild our system and we have done that im very pleased by that very pleased when i see the young players we have in our system to go from where we were this time last year to where we are now is amazing
6681733 ive seen all of their minor league guys and believe me when i say this billy did a good thing
6681734 of all the organizations ive seen they have the best talent ive seen this year he has a plan
6681735 given the direction were going we thought it was the proper move at the time long term well benefit from it with the players we got
6681736 part of it is that we played so well before the break it seems like rebuilding happens overnight and it doesnt
6681737 last year we were in third place our payroll was growing beyond our means and we had no farm system now were in third place but have the system we wanted and our payroll has been reduced to the point that we have more flexibility to do some other things
6681738 were taking our licks right now but were going to come back next year and be unbelievable
6681739 when everyone here figures out what were doing we can pull off something like tampa bay has this year no one here should have their heads down
6681740 and i kind of waited a little bit and found a little quiet place and had some time to think about what happened and yeah i cried a little bit
6681741 but its tough on a relationship its tough on a marriage to be away from each other all the time
6681742 were talking about coming back but we dont have anything to say yet
6681743 im not sure of the details but rickey is a great guy for community relations
6681744 to live life is not always a walk through the meadow
6681745 if i got rid of all my demons i might lose my angels too
6681746 ever since i was living in japan i had this concept of an izakaya
6681747 if you want sushi you go to a sushi restaurant if you want
6681748 here we have everything and its smaller plates its affordable
6681749 japanese food was not for me it wasnt my style
6681750 it blocks the aging process by preventing moisture which causes freezer burn
6681751 we had some tomatoes and i thought about using those and i had a neighbor who was always talking about doing a garlic beer so we added that i had some fresh oregano some basil an old packet of yeast
6681752 i said it probably wont work if it doesnt we can just cook with it
6681753 the first time we tasted it we looked at each other and said you know its actually good
6681754 none of them worked so i said you know what lets pop open one of those tomato beers we gave it one taste and i said holy s this is fantastic its perfect with pizza
6681755 thats basically one bottle at a time because most people dont buy a whole case
6681756 create resentment and anger among those firms we have to retain
6681757 its just 3 1 2 years of dreaming now its over silver medal im not complaining im going to take it all in and soak it all up have fun and put my bid in for 2012
6681758 there are bigger bikes that have been used in national competitions but they arent as fast as these
6681759 physically you have to be a man to do this sport
6681760 them crashing behind me just makes it easier for me
6681761 i rode my best lap and coming home with a bronze im super psyched on that most importantly im just glad we put on a good show between the action the air the crashes its a cool sport but yet you can see that were pretty good role models so its good for the parents too
6681762 this is a huge coming out party for this sport
6681763 entist pienempien ja halvempien palvelinten kysynt sek kehittyvilt markkinoilta tulleiden tilausten kasvu auttoivat palvelinvalmistajia ponnistamaan yhdysvaltain taantumaa vastaan
6681764 i was out with two gal friends and needed an updoo for a party
6681765 the guy who was in the other movie for a few minutes
6681766 hey check out this stranger i think id like to piss off fuck with accost in any way shape or form
6681767 high prices remain the pervasive problem of filipino families with women primarily carrying the burden of the insufficiency of the family budget despite the lowering of oil prices prices of goods and services remain high thus we must heighten the fight for the repeal of the vat
6681768 the department of finance itself said that only p13 billion of the expected vat revenues will go to social services as it expects to collect an estimated p100 billion more in vat clearly the filipino public is being cheated it is like paying p100 in exchange for something only worth p13
6681769 those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
6681770 i could not become anything neither bad nor good neither a scoundrel nor an honest man neither a hero nor an insect and now i am eking out my days in my corner taunting myself with the bitter and entirely useless consolation that an intelligent man cannot seriously become anything that only a fool can become something
6681771 its a good hard and fast way to get a big swim in
6681772 then you start the 15 x 100s with fatigue in your arms and you need to increase your stroke rate and crank up the heart rate to maintain your best pace it takes two or three to find your rhythm and then it is hammer time for eight the last four or five you really start to feel the muscle burn and perhaps a little lactic acid creeping in to make the finish of the set oh so enjoyable before you know it though you are done and you just hammered out 3 km of quality well paced swimming
6681773 the ability to hold form on tired arms dictates how well you will swim the second half of your race
6681774 for a less skilled swimmer it is sometimes difficult to swim well after a pull set
6681775 additionally i find that triathletes swim better when they have a level of leg kick conditioning to support their freestyle while they dont need to kick as much as a single sport swimmer it shouldnt be completely neglected fitness kicking should be done with a board
6681776 you can do this special workout any time of year and probably twice a week if youre hardcore

6681802 but since they have classified us as casual employees we are deprived of our benefits as government employees holding plantilla positions this is a very unjust decision of the intramuros administration particularly of merceditas de sahagun and mely veluz the chief of the personnel division
6681803 because of the administrations move our membership with the gsis pag ibig fund and philhealth as well as our incentives such as bonuses are terminated
6681804 we believe ms harper has something to do with this
6681805 ive been meaning to write a review for di napoli for a while now but i just keep forgetting to do it
6681806 i am man hear me roar the numbers too big to ignore and im way too hungry to settle for chick foooood

6681809 there is a student special but it is only available on the first day
6681810 although i live right around the corner ive only been to annies twice
6681811 hah i bet the food wont even be that spicy
6681812 well i know the name is spices but they must have non spicy dishes right i mean ihop has like non pancake things
6681813 but when i got elected to the executive board of the players association i told gene i need you to be the player rep
6681814 because i saw those qualities that other people hadnt seen i knew right away that gene had the leadership and qualities to be a leader on and off the football field thats why we picked him as one of the captains of the team
6681815 gene was a great player he was an all pro he was a hall of famer if you look at the history of the nfl youre going to find out that he was one of the most influential people that the league has known he did so much not only for the players but also for the owners the teams and the game of pro football
6681816 when i think about gene upshaw i think about no 63 pulling
6681817 a lot of people called it highway 63 thats what i remember and i know about gene because when he pulled around that left side he got in like a hurricane coming through wiped out everything that was there
6681818 gene was tough he just felt he couldnt get beat he had the determination to be the very best and when we drafted him mr davis knew that he would be the very best
6681819 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6681820 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6681821 a guy like delamielleure says the things he said about me you think im going to invite him to dinner no im going to break his damn neck
6681822 the reality of life for all the guys who played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span its just the way it is
6681823 i have sympathy for his family i have sympathy for his wife and children i didnt know gene personally i just knew him professionally
6681824 in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but he didnt always do so
6681825 he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game in the big picture

6681844 and well also have a kick around in dublin on saturday evening and that will give us a chance to see how graham and nicholas go in it
6681845 at this stage we thought both players would be further advanced in their recovery process but nicholas started jogging on sunday and he kicked a few balls on tuesday night
6681846 both players are continuing to receive treatment on a daily basis and improvement in players condition can be quite significant in a short space of time
6681847 in noel oleary john miskella and kevin macmahon we have three lads who were regulars in last years run to the all ireland final
6681848 we did extremely well to turn around that scenario into a five point winning margin
6681849 our game plan didnt work out in the first half and we reverted to a more traditional approach for the second half
6681850 but it would be a tall order to expect us to claw back an eight point deficit again and a question must also be asked about kerrys state of mind for the second half of the munster final

6681865 i have to were not changing generals in the middle of the war thats what they do over in iraq every other week theres a new damn general over there
6681866 were going to be here and were going to see this through and then well see where the chips fall but im not leaving until we have a deal
6681867 weve begun already talking about the succession process prior to this well continue along those lines that weve already been on and will identify those individuals and hopefully well come up with that one person who will be able to lead us and bring us even further than we are right now
6681868 youre talking about a man whos left behind an incredible legacy from where we started at way back in the day to where it is today with what the league is bringing in dollarwise and all the player benefits and different things gene has had a hand in hes left this organization in a very very good place
6681869 weve learned in the nfl that not everybody is the enemy
6681870 we all have to work together if we have prosperity we have to keep the peace not make war
6681871 paul and i have had discussions about how people perceive us
6681872 we have a relationship where we can just sit down and talk without even talking about business we can talk about the history of the game about what hes been through what ive been through
6681873 all of those things are why weve had success paul and i always tried to look at everything from each others perspective if we know what the common good is we know where we have to go its never been about either one of us trying to one up the other its always been about what can we do to make our product better and grow it if people dont understand that thats their problem not ours
6681874 few people in the history of the nfl have played the game as well as gene and then had another career in football with so much positive impact on the structure and competitiveness of the entire league as gene
6681875 in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but he didnt always do so he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture
6681876 the position he took of creating a partnership with the owners and getting a meaningful majority of the gross revenues and then focusing on building the revenue pot to raise the boat of all the players was absolutely right it was a total win for everybody its hard to imagine there are many people who wouldve been in his position and had the foresight to think of this as an option
6681877 but i never got the chance i ended up coming here to the nflpa
6681878 but thats ok its not going to stop me from doing what i have to do but it does enter the picture from time to time they dont want to accept that i can do this job its always a little tougher
6681879 kyles ready he has been around in this system and he has played
6681880 we have good practices and then go out and play lousy
6681881 its more important for me to win over my teammates
6681882 hey i think i know you where are you from how did you get here
6681883 youre welcome but you didnt tell me where you were from
6681884 thats no longer the question they just might be the best athletic team ever period
6681885 you have to understand china had built the beach volleyball stadium a few years ago and used it to train their women who lived in nearby dormitories with their coaches and trainers
6681886 as we all now know china was determined to do well in these olympics to show the world what theyre all about and they were particularly determined to do well in games popular in the western countries and one of the sports they badly wanted to win was beach volleyball
6681887 there were several plays late in both sets in which the other team could have scored on but misty reversed it and scored herself that put the pressure on the other team and they couldnt handle it thats what separated the two teams
6681888 when it is close late and you think youre going to score and the other team does frustration sets in and thats what happened to the chinese team
6681889 ive never seen misty and kerri so focused for a match they didnt celebrate or talk much during it they just kept their concentration and misty made a couple of big plays that caused the chinese girls to break down emotionally
6681890 misty and kerri have the perfect chemistry and complement each other perfectly to me theres never been a team like theirs in any sport
6681891 oh misty has become pretty good friends with the president
6681892 i was told he called her two or three times during the olympics
6681893 what always stood misty apart from the others is that she had a natural feel for the game
6681894 i think she learned that from playing it so often when she was young much like tiger woods did she grew up playing volleyball and thats evident every time shes out there on the court doing her thing
6681895 this is a significant step forward in the long term management of low back pain
6681896 the results of this study revealed that the alexander technique can help back pain it probably does this by limiting muscle spasm strengthening postural muscles improving co ordination and flexibility and decompressing the spine
6681897 this means that patients can have fewer activities or functions limited by back pain

6681905 in preclinical studies using a mouse model enb 0040 consistently improved survival as well as bone and dental manifestations of hypophosphatasia the initiation of clinical studies brings us closer to the goal of providing drug therapy for hypophosphatasia patients where none currently exists

6681960 weve seen an increase in terms of clothes school supplies broken in sports gear its a great way to get brand name styles for cheaper
6681961 its not just the working poor were also seeing more middle class families coming to us
6681962 parents would go naked before they would send their kids to school without the right tools to be able to get an education
6681963 you dont want a child to feel embarrassed or left out
6681964 thats not a good way to start the school year

6681969 genital herpes is a significant and growing public health issue all previous attempts to develop either a prophylactic or therapeutic vaccine have either failed or have shown efficacy in only a very limited proportion of the population we believe that this vaccine based on a new understanding of hsv biology has the potential to substantially advance the field accordingly todays news is a significant milestone towards realizing this potential
6681970 our laboratory recently discovered that even when pten is produced normally by a cell it has to be properly localized within the nucleus in order to maintain its full tumor suppressive abilities
6681971 indeed its been demonstrated that in a variety of cancers pten has broken away from the nucleus with these new findings we now understand how this happens
6681972 from there we observed that the loss of another tumor suppressor known as pml whose mutation is a main cause of acute promyelocytic leukemia was at the root of ptens escape from the nucleus
6681973 we discovered that this pathway is disrupted through the loss or mutation of pml as well as through unchecked hausp expression either of which can force pten from the nucleus and prevent its ability to act as a tumor suppressor
6681974 the modulation of the pml hausp pathway offers us an exciting and unique approach to enhancing the tumor suppressive actions of pten
6681975 because pml is known to be druggable we believe that in cases of apl modulation of pten function can be achieved with drugs already being used for the treatment of human cancers including interferon and all trans retinoic acid
6681976 its like planting a big red flag on the tumor to attract the attention of the bodys immune system which normally ignores cancerous cells
6681977 its a great idea we just dont know how to do it yet
6681978 we will ask the igg antibodies to carry the bacteria derived nucleic acid as a guest throughout the body
6681979 this will allow the nucleic acid to circulate for days which is different from how antibodies have been used in classical targeted delivery
6681980 rapidly growing solid tumors are surrounded by imperfect almost chaotic blood flow
6681981 the tissue is very leaky because of this unusual permeability the antibody nucleic acid complex should become lodged in the tumor periphery this should mimic a local infection which the body will work to eliminate
6681982 our findings may someday allow doctors to screen for and diagnose skin cancers at very early stages
6681983 chemical biomarkers may eventually serve as objective clinical markers of disease if effective sensor technology can be developed

6681990 theres so many different moving pieces here and so much red tape
6681991 we wanted to move the warning track over two inches oh my gosh stop everything we need this meeting and that meeting everything eventually happens but it all just moves slow
6681992 thats historic for this country it wasnt supposed to happen and it happened on that field right over there
6681993 that computer did reveal a lot of information about the goings on in the house
6681994 what happened is that potentially motivated by emotion and sympathy in the death of a 2 year old the court issued a general warrant
6681995 the police just went in and took out what they wanted the entire search was improper
6681996 but i dont think it came as a result of any actions of the police officers

6682003 10 separate meetings with political parties and civil society groups including members of the central executive committee of the national league for democracy student representatives and elected individuals from the 1990 elections
6682004 this statement is not only misleading but patently false gambari did not meet with political parties and civil society groups
6682005 in his first three days in the country he spent more than two days in meetings with the regime their business cronies and civilian front organizations and just 20 minutes with the national league for democracy
6682006 how can gambari achieve anything when he allows the burmese regime to dictate his schedule and spends only 20 minutes with pro democracy groups
6682007 i now cant go into exact minutes he has been meeting with a wide range of actors on the ground with the focus on the need for a credible and inclusive political process and dialogue
6682008 as i mentioned to you earlier he is there to continue his dialogue with all concerned
6682009 by any measure the record of gambari and the un is one of failure
6682010 because gambari has kowtowed to the regime on his schedule he was even unable to meet aung san suu kyi because she had made a simple request that she meet with gambari and her political party members at the same time

6682020 its got to be through relationships handing out religious tracts would not go over well at all that would be like me walking around with a free tibet flag
6682021 if foreigners do such things in china they violate the law and local religious departments and other departments should stop them
6682022 we slipped past the security and looked all over that thing and we can confirm absolutely that it is not a nest

6682035 the most consistently beautiful country of the former soviet union
6682036 before the conflict started only two three percent of the world had heard of georgia
6682037 at present most of the worlds population know about the country
6682038 i dont look at it as being any different from the pressure of the position that we play
6682039 you cant be thinking about stuff like that its incumbent for people in this position to have a competitive edge you have a great group of young and talented guys so there is competition going on but i dont think anybody really worries about the decisions that are going to be made by the front office we just go out there and compete and were still trying to make each other better
6682040 a missed tackle a dropped pick a missed assignment all that comes into their minds when theyre thinking about making cuts so youve always got to perform to your best
6682041 being at the low end of the totem pole coming in ive just got to keep grinding

6682066 her majestys government have had a returns memorandum of understanding mou with the authorities in somaliland based in hargeisa since 2003 the mou forms the basis for the return to somaliland of those whom the somaliland authorities in hargeisa consider to have a right to reside in somaliland and who do not qualify to remain in the uk removal to southern somalia mogadishu is secured without the need for an mou there is currently no embargo on enforced removals to mogadishu
6682067 mogadishu is another darfur in the making it is sad to see that no one seems to care about the untold suffering of the helpless in somalia
6682068 i think what we have seen in mogadishu over the last six to eight months there is really little comparison when you look around the world in terms of the gravity of the crimes and the scale of displacement
6682069 with the end of the fighting and there continuing to be no evidence of continuing fatalities injuries in any significant numbers there is no longer any real risk that a returnee to mogadishu would be caught in the cross fire or killed or seriously injured by indiscriminate bombing or other military action although there have been reports of a number of small explosions in the city since the fighting stopped these appear to be isolated and targeted incidents and do not demonstrate that there is a real risk
6682070 although the humanitarian situation in the city is poor there is not such an absence of the basic necessities of life that to return someone to those conditions would lead to an immediate threat to their life or exposes them to conditions which result in a total loss of human dignity many people who fled mogadishu during the fighting are now returning food water and shelter are available schools re opened on 5 may and medical treatment is being provided
6682071 despite measures by the transitional federal government tfg to improve security in mogadishu the situation continued to deteriorate violence persisted with increased random bomb attacks and grenades explosions harming many innocent civilians ethiopian tfg troops as well as ugandan peace keepers assassinations and failed attempted murders of government officials or those deemed to side with the tfg were also reported house to house weapon searches continued limiting the movement of people due to day imposed curfews in targeted districts this greatly hampered livelihood activities for residents
6682072 the continuing numbers flying to mogadishu the absence of reports indicating particular problems with travel from the airport the presence of african union troops at the airport and the city and the general reduction in conflict in and around mogadishu suggests on balance that it is possible to travel safely from the airport
6682073 a cargo plane transporting ugandan soldiers to somalias capital caught fire as it landed at mogadishus airport three rockets were fired at the plane and one hit the plane somali government spokesman hussein mohamed muhamoud told the agence france presse news agency

6682084 yes america and its allies have enthrone democracy in iraq but can wesustain it the weakness of the arabic leaderships is shameful and distressing and they do not feel ashamed of themselves with their negativity that insulted this nations dignity and led it to the lowest level anyway i am saying this thing for you to understand the feeling of an average iraqi on the street and the reason most of us who have the opportunity are doing this kind of thing ask an iraqi boy on the street are you iraqi he will say no i am sunni shiite orkurdish he will not mention iraq worst of this is the obnoxious kurdish tradition which strips the womam of all her husbands wealth and transfer it to the brothers of the man when the man dies that is my situation here

6682095 gelingt es den mietspiegel zu manipulieren wird er faktisch wertlos
6682096 ein qualifizierter mietspiegel wie er in berlin vorliegt dient nicht nur dazu mieterh hungen zu begr nden sondern mieter k nnen damit im zweifelsfall auch beweisen dass ihr vermieter zu viel verlangt

6682111 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6682112 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6682113 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6682114 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

6682150 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6682151 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

6682163 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6682164 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6682165 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6682166 warning of severe erosion risk by 2040 needs to be on the ad like a cigarette packet perhaps
6682167 there will be losses there will be damaging events and we need to accept that fact
6682168 it is an issue of significant magnitude and it does need proper assessment and all governments working together to minimise the risks and ensure there is as little damage as possible
6682169 this really is very early work and many more factors need to be taken into account before we have concrete projections
6682170 it is going to be a negative story leading to damage of assets and loss of value
6682171 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6682172 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6682173 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6682174 de basis van een website is altijd tekst omdat tekst informatie overbrengt goed initiatief van kuoni op deze manier kunnen ze goed zien wat nu online 79 bezoekers
6682175 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6682176 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6682177 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6682178 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6682179 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6682180 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6682181 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6682182 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6682183 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6682184 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6682185 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6682186 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6682187 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6682188 again though i ask what do we do with these men and yes women who have served what
6682189 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6682190 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6682191 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6682192 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6682193 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base

6682195 por eso se llama sala de cuidados intensivos el peligro est latente entonces vamos a esperar que la abandone y ya una vez fuera de esta unidad se pueda hacer una evaluaci n completa
6682196 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6682197 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6682198 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6682199 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6682200 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6682201 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6682202 their advertised programs either did not exist as represented or did not offer quick and easy money with little time or effort as promised
6682203 napster should be exploring all possible avenues of maximizing stockholder value
6682204 the actions taken by the current board have made that option extremely difficult for potential acquirers
6682205 generous senior executive compensation practices overall have created incentives for management not to sell the company
6682206 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6682207 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6682208 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6682209 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6682210 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6682211 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6682212 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6682213 who are open to doing something on the production side
6682214 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6682215 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6682216 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6682217 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6682218 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6682219 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6682220 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6682221 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6682222 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6682223 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6682224 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6682225 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6682226 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6682227 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6682228 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6682229 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6682230 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6682231 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6682232 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6682233 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6682234 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6682235 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6682236 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

6682270 salga is gravely concerned by these debts as they threaten the financial viability of our municipalities this situation has the potential to have a devastating effect on service delivery
6682271 we call on municipalities to do everything possible including discontinuing services to those who do not pay or make acceptable payment arrangements
6682272 salga once again calls upon those government departments who are not meeting their obligations to set a good example by settling their debts without further procrastination
6682273 it is clear from the poor working class poor communities that those who are rich and white will continue to be treated differently to those who are poor

6682276 we respect the rule of law but it is disgusting that there is a continued tendency or a systematic abortion of justice on matters related to the murder of black workers in the country this reinforces our long held belief that the rule of law in this country favours the rich particularly whites and regards the lives of black workers as shallow and cheap

6682337 it is always nice to be recognized in this way however our admissions officers always tell prospective students that they should select a college or university that best suits their needs not by its position in a ranking
6682338 we have worked and will continue to work very hard to enhance the academic experience for undergraduate students
6682339 one of the criticisms of the rankings is that they move very slowly it takes a long time for schools to improve
6682340 they may be doing things today that arent going to be reflected for five years in the rankings we wanted to find a way to illuminate some schools that are doing some really interesting thing

6682353 the recent violent attacks by milf elements have of course shaken many of mindanaos residents who have every right to demand greater protection

6682372 the acccs market inquiries indicated that the proposed acquisition may raise competition concerns in relation to the global seaborne supply of iron ore lump and iron ore fines
6682373 to the extent the proposed acquisition lessens competition in the global seaborne supply of iron ore it would be likely to have the effect of increasing global iron ore prices which would in turn increase prices paid by steel makers in australia
6682374 interested parties also expressed concern that there would appear to be few alternative suppliers capable of supplying significant quantities of iron ore lump and iron ore fines at a cost that would be likely to impose an effective competitive constraint on the merged firm across the anticipated business cycle
6682375 in particular vale would be the only other supplier involved in annual benchmark price negotiations

6682385 allegation that a copyright owner acted in bad faith by issuing a takedown notice without proper consideration of the fair use doctrine thus is sufficient to state a misrepresentation claim

6682392 i think the whole root of the matter lies in the fact that when a writer is young he feels somehow that what he is going to say is rather silly or obvious or commonplace and then he tries to hide it under baroque ornament under words taken from the seventeenth century writers or if not and he sets out to be modern then he does the contrary hes inventing words all the time or alluding to airplanes railway trains or the telegraph and telephone cause hes doing his best to be modern then as time goes on one feels that ones ideas good or bad should be plainly expressed because if you have an idea you must try to get that idea or feeling or that mood into the mind of the reader

6682433 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
6682434 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
6682435 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
6682436 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
6682437 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
6682438 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
6682439 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
6682440 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
6682441 at the moment the liverpool situation means barry is not at his best that is my opinion
6682442 one of the most unpleasant things that currently exists in the game
6682443 im not saying it detracts from the football but its maybe not the right time for these things to be going on
6682444 the important league season has started already and you get the same points for matches now as you do at the end of the season but many teams are still thinking about who is coming and who is leaving
6682445 after recently being asked by the england management to reassess my retirement from international one day cricket ive decided to join englands squad for the natwest series after careful consideration
6682446 its something i have been thinking about for a period of time and due to recent injuries in the england camp the opportunity has arisen for me to play a role in this series
6682447 i decided to retire from englands odi team for a number reasons one being the amount of time i was spending away from my family
6682448 now that my family is settled and my bowling is settled i feel i have something to offer englands odi side and am looking forward to playing a part in the natwest series against south africa
6682449 having missed out on test selection at various times this year i am well aware of the disappointment that comes from not being a part of the england dressing room
6682450 with that in mind i want to be a part of the team and if that means bringing myself out of retirement to play a role in this upcoming natwest series then im happy to do just that
6682451 at the moment my focus is on doing well in the odis against south africa and im not looking beyond that at this stage
6682452 i think they need him desperately in one day cricket
6682453 especially in the last couple of overs of the powerplays and then going through the middle period where guys are getting ones and twos if they get in they generally play it how they want it but hes the guy who can let you still attack as a captain
6682454 it would give you a totally different option to a lot of sides they dont have that
6682455 its our goal to be as relevant as possible to as many people as we can

6682470 lenz listen to what i just thought of if i were to find a florin and you were to give me another one then id borrow yet another one and youd give me still another one and then i would take the four florins and buy a young cow
6682471 where im to get that florin im supposed to give you but after you have the money to buy a cow it will be a good thing
6682472 im looking forward to the time after the cow calves so i can have some good refreshing milk to drink
6682473 we will let the calf suck so it will grow large and fat and we can sell it for a good price
6682474 but it wont hurt anything if we take a little milk
6682475 i wont allow it whether it will hurt anything or not you can stand on your head but you wont get a single drop of milk lanky lenz just because you are always hungry you think that you can devour everything that my hard work brings in

6682484 milf units that targeted villages have engaged in serious violations of international law and should be held to account
6682485 but experience from around the world shows that the deployment of civilian militias can set off a chain of reprisals and only increases the danger facing civilians
6682486 the recent violent attacks by milf elements have of course shaken many of mindanaos residents who have every right to demand greater protection

6682526 ho iniziato ad interessarmi alle falsificazioni quando il nostro ospedale ha iniziato ad eseguire i test andai a casa e telefonai ad 800 numeri telefonici trovati online e scoprii che potevo comprare qualsiasi cosa per falsificare i test bastava pagare non e chiaro come mai ci siano cosi tanti prodotti
6682527 alcune pensano che questi prodotti siano efficienti perche costosi spesso non lo sono e altre volte sono le persone a non saperli adoperare
6682528 i test sui dipendenti rivelano a livello nazionale una diminuzione del consumo
6682529 il personale sanitario quelli della difesa e quelli delle compagnie aeree da anni sono esaminati
6682530 ora anche altri settori si rivolgono ai test come quello delle costruzioni dellinsegnamento e dei servizi pubblici questo rivela un aumento di consapevolezza del problema del consumo non ci sono solo test prima di essere assunti ma anche durante gli anni di servizio

6682536 it is in vain to summon a people which has been rendered so dependent on the central power to choose from time to time the representatives of that power

6682542 when dealing with people let us remember that we are not dealing with creatures of logic we are dealing with creatures of emotion creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity
6682543 be more concerned with your character than with your reputation your character is what you really are while your reputation is merely what others think you are
6682544 there aint no material things left at that point you aint supposed to focus on what you look like its sinful

6682552 i didnt wear a hat i didnt wear a boa there was one shot in close up where they told me to rest my head on my arm and i did that but most of them came out really good i got several 5x10s of one where i was wearing the denim and you can have one of the wallet sized ones

6682558 incomprensibile che il dalai lama pubblicizzi queste sue richieste attraverso un giornalista occidentale invece di sollevarle direttamente con il governo centrale dato che pechino ha detto pi volte che la porta del dialogo aperta ha scritto jin parlare attraverso la bocca di un giornalista americano riduce la credibilit del suo messaggio e ci si chiede se il dalai voglia veramente risolvere i problemi o si tratti di una nuova fumosa campagna di pubbliche relazioni rivolta alloccidente

6682575 david will be a good signing for us he has lots of experience at the top level and his international record is phenomenal
6682576 he scored a few goals for fulham last season one of them was a well taken strike against us at craven cottage and he is another signing who will increase competition for places
6682577 in the light of the weeks events it is prudent that we pause any further reductions while the current situation is unfolding

6682602 warning of severe erosion risk by 2040 needs to be on the ad like a cigarette packet perhaps
6682603 there will be losses there will be damaging events and we need to accept that fact
6682604 it is an issue of significant magnitude and it does need proper assessment and all governments working together to minimise the risks and ensure there is as little damage as possible
6682605 this really is very early work and many more factors need to be taken into account before we have concrete projections
6682606 it is going to be a negative story leading to damage of assets and loss of value

6682655 i can understand the valley press being prejudiced and engaging in yellow journalism but the national media has been misleading public opinion on this issue which is a matter of great concern

6682663 while child welfare services had improved an immigration removal centre can never be a suitable place for children and we were dismayed to find cases of disabled children being detained and some children spending large amounts of time incarcerated
6682664 any period of detention can be detrimental to children and their families but the impact of lengthy detention is particularly extreme
6682665 which was not surprising given the sometimes traumatic circumstances in which many had initially been detained
6682666 we found examples in the recent past of children with disabilities who ought not to have been detained

6682710 guardando la storia del mercato darte spiega si vede chiaramente come cambiato nei secoli il potere economico il passaggio dalleuropa agli stati uniti nel novecento il boom del giappone alla fine degli anni 80 e ora lo spostamento verso la russia la cina e il medio oriente la vendita di grandi opere darte si allontana dagli stati uniti e prende altre direzioni a giugno per la prima volta abbiamo venduto una grande collezione darte americana a londra invece che a new york londra forse pi importante perch l i compratori russi si sentono pi a loro agio
6682711 onestamente speravamo di mantenere i livelli record raggiunti negli ultimi due anni e pensavamo che il 2008 sarebbe stato pi difficile data la situazione di crisi economica ma questi primi sei mesi sono stati straordinari e ci hanno confuso non ci troviamo per di fronte a una bolla speculativa come sostengono alcuni quello che sta succedendo nel mercato il risultato di due cambiamenti la provenienza dei nuovi clienti e il tipo di ricchezza che hanno che non comparabile con quella che conoscevamo e poi c un grande cambiamento di gusti un calo dellinteresse per le opere del tardo 19esimo secolo e del 18esimo secolo e lattenzione al moderno e al nuovo questo significa che ci sono un alto numero di oggetti perch se la disponibilit di impressionisti molto limitata invece molto pi grande per le opere di arte contemporanea
6682712 e invece accadr perch ci sono molte persone che cercano le stesse opere e che hanno molti pi soldi di quelli che vedevamo prima e non sono speculatori ma compratori che stanno creando le loro collezioni che stanno costruendo musei in russia in oriente e nei paesi arabi e hanno deciso di investire enormi somme per costruire grandi gallerie
6682713 i nostri nuovi clienti vengono non solo da russia e cina ma anche da sud america medio oriente e india certo vendiamo ancora in america e in europa ma non pi come prima se in occidente c crisi in altre regioni del mondo si sente la forza del petrolio del boom delle materie prime e non si sa cosa sia la recessione ma sarebbe sbagliato trattarli come nuovi ricchi i russi hanno una forte tradizione di collezionismo basta andare allhermitage o al museo puskin di mosca per rendersene conto cos penso che questi valori reggeranno e tra dieci anni ci saranno molte opere che si venderanno a 80 milioni di dollari senza pi stupore
6682714 quando hai clienti come lui ne basterebbero un paio allanno sui quale costruire non gente che va e viene sono una cinquantina nel mondo e fanno la differenza
6682715 hanno cominciato a vendere si rendono conto che sono in competizione con gente che pu spendere di pi e hanno cambiato il loro modo di pensare invece di comprare guardano alle loro collezioni e vendono alcuni pezzi per molti pi soldi di quelli che avrebbero mai immaginato
6682716 una delle cose pi interessanti che sta accadendo il comportamento del governo di pechino che vuole tornare in possesso dei grandi capolavori cinesi che erano stati venduti allestero secoli fa e lo fa partecipando alle aste pubbliche
6682717 nel far distillare dai testi biblici il senso che vi si trova nascosto
6682718 ha lottato e sofferto per la libert della chiesa e per questa libert si rivelato pronto a sacrificare privilegi ed onori ad affrontare incomprensione e derisione in quanto valutava questa libert come garanzia ultima per lintegrit e la coerenza della fede
6682719 se gli uomini sapessero che cos vivere in grazia non si spaventerebbero di nessuna sofferenza e patirebbero volentieri qualunque pena perch la grazia frutto della pazienza

6682729 tonight from the forwards to the defense and me we were a team
6682730 its interesting because everyone says all the time that we win and no one can compete
6682731 to support the suspicion of abuse and neglect professional school employees may gather information by interviewing the child
6682732 she did a reasonable review and acted as a reasonable professional would
6682733 i feel bad for nordick but we want to make sure it doesnt break again
6682734 we owe it as far as im concerned to the children who will be carrying this burden for the rest of their lives
6682735 she cares deeply about the school and children i just feel like the sheriffs office has gone about it the wrong way
6682736 and a tiresome job to drive such a goat out to the field year in and year out until late in the fall if i could only lie down and sleep at it but no i must keep my eyes open so it wont damage the young trees or force its way through the hedge into a garden or even run away altogether how can i get some rest and enjoy life
6682737 i will marry fat trina she too has a goat and she can drive mine out with hers and then i shall no longer have to torment myself
6682738 im doing this so that afterwards i will enjoy resting more otherwise i shall lose all feeling for it
6682739 why should we make our lives so miserable ruining the best days of our youth when there is no need for it the two goats disturb our best sleep every morning with their bleating wouldnt it be better for us to give them to our neighbor who will give us a beehive for them we will put the beehive in a sunny place behind the house and then not give it any more thought bees do not have to be taken care of nor driven into the field they fly out and find their way home again by themselves and they collect honey without any effort at all on our part
6682740 we will carry out your proposal without delay and furthermore honey tastes better and is more nourishing than goats milk and it keeps longer too
6682741 women are fond of sweets and you have been snacking on the honey it would be better for us to exchange it for a goose with a young gosling before you eat it all up
6682742 but not before we have a child to take care of them
6682743 that the boy will tend geese nowadays children no longer obey they do just as they please because they think that they are smarter than their parents just like that servant who was supposed to look for the cow and chased after three blackbirds
6682744 he will get it if he does not do what i say i will take a stick and tan his hide with more blows than can be counted
6682745 and they do not need to be tended but it is lucky that the jug did not fall on my head we have every reason to be satisfied with our fate
6682746 wife let us enjoy the leftovers and then we will rest a little from the fright we have had what does it matter if we get up a little later than usual the day will be long enough
6682747 limmacolata vergine finito il corso della sua vita terrena fu assunta alla celeste gloria in anima e corpo e dal signore esaltata come regina delluniverso perch fosse pi pienamente conformata al suo figlio signore dei dominanti e vincitore del peccato e della morte

6682754 the man started throwing wild punches at the woman who did not give up but kept punching back
6682755 men who harass women in public places should be expecting that kind of beating from women
6682756 the man who was floored had a very bad habit of pinching womens buttocks in public
6682757 its ok honey you just need to be more careful next time
6682758 he has started the quarrel or fight for no reason and make him feel the height of his stupidity

6682768 his variation seems unreal he could snare 500 wickets by the time people are able to figure him out
6682769 there are few quality spinners on the horizon and im a great admirer of the spinning craft exhibited by mendis
6682770 hes not looking for dot balls hes looking for a wicket with every delivery
6682771 the way he bamboozled indias batsmen in the tests was amazing
6682772 the indian batsmen have come across a pair of top class spinners after a long time
6682773 theyll have to concentrate more and plan better to save themselves from embarrassment
6682774 it amazes me why the indian batsmen are trying to read mendis by the length of his deliveries they ought to be watching the bowlers wrist and fingers but our batsmen are trying to reach the pitch of the ball
6682775 its probably because they havent played against quality spinners over a long duration
6682776 any way how many of these indian test players regularly play domestic cricket
6682777 a lot of the indian players have had their fill
6682778 the fire in the belly seems to be diminishing and thats a dangerous sign
6682779 the arrival of twenty20 cricket in a big way has surely diverted the players attention
6682780 also they had little time to prepare for the test series and that led to the dismal performance

6682786 these days russuan prime minister vladimir putin is often compared unfairly with stalin and hitler in truth putin is a russian kennedy and putins cuba is called georgia russias invasion of georgia has brought lovers of historical comparisons out of the woodwork swedish foreign minister carl bildt for one compared vladimir putin with hitler and former us national security advisor zbigniew brzezinski felt reminded of stalins treatment of finland but these analogies have more to say about the wests mood than about putin although it may sound bold at first and although the americans wont like hearing it the vladimir putin the world has experienced in recent days bears the strongest resemblance to former us president john f kennedy in the years 1961 and 1962 first the youthful kennedy was seen as the embodiment of a new america just as the wiry putin represents russias revival kennedy was and putin is deeply popular among his own citizens second even kennedy drew a distinction between first class and second class sovereign states he assumed that residents of the main house ought to have something to say in the backyard as in cuba for example putin shares the same view in the case of georgia for example in americas case we call such behavior dominant and in russias case aggressive but we mean the same thing third thinking in terms of spheres of influence had military consequences for kennedy as it does for putin in cuba kennedy even took things a step further than the russian prime minister has done in georgia in april 1961 the american central intelligence agency cia supported the landing of cuban exiles in playa gir n on cubas bay of pigs kennedy wanted to bring about regime change in havana by force a step putin stopped short of in georgia nevertheless his desire to evict the georgian president from the seat of government was undoubtedly as great as kennedys interest in overthrowing cuban dictator fidel castro the effort to bring about regime change in havana failed but kennedy refused to recognized cubas sovereignty when the soviet union began stationing nuclear warheads in cuba the us president threatened war in october 1962 the world held its breath until russia recognized americas claim to its own backyard and then premier nikita khrushchev on sunday oct 28 ordered the withdrawal of the missiles now us secretary of state condoleezza rice and her president george w bush say that other laws apply today than in the 20th century it sounds plausible but it isnt true as is clearly evident in the case of cuba america still treats the caribbean island with its stone age communism as a public enemy american citizens can neither visit cuba a country with a gross domestic product a fraction the size of the uss nor can they trade with it cuban cigars are considered contraband and any american who smokes them is regarded as an enemy of state but the comforting message for russians and americans alike is this the two nations are not as different as they would like to think they think similarly they act similarly and they even speak the same language namely that of power politics europes task is to prevent the current situation from escalating at the present time nato expansion into russias front yard does not increase security it merely serves to heighten tensions in europe the cuba crisis was followed by another 10 years of cold war before a policy of d tente came to prevail perhaps that road can be shortened this time around and what happens to georgia respecting russias interests doesnt mean betraying democracy georgias national integrity is not up for debate but it would do the country good to tone down its pro american rhetoric a bit a look to the caribbean can also be comforting for the georgian president kennedy is dead but communism lives on

6682809 sacred scripture is the word of god set down in writing sacra scriptura est locutio dei scripto consignatur
6682810 the divine scriptures having been set down in writing once and for all divina e scriptura e semel pro semper litteris consignat
6682811 which are contained and presented in writing in sacred scripture qu in sacra scriptura litteris continentur et prostant
6682812 since therefore affirmed by the holy spirit we must acknowledge that the books of scripture firmly faithfully and without error teach that truth which god for the sake of our salvation wished to see confided to the sacred scriptures
6682813 therefore since asserted by the holy spirit it follows that the books of scripture must be acknowledged as teaching firmly faithfully and without error that truth which god wanted put into the sacred writings for the sake of our salvation
6682814 all scripture is inspired by god and profitable for teaching for reproof for correction and for training in righteousness so that the man of god may be complete equipped for every good work

6682820 getting vaccinated is the safest thing we can do for children
6682821 at the national level i am concerned about our situation
6682822 every year the u s experiences importation of measles what is different this year is once it is imported we are seeing it spread to more people and most of that spread is to people under 20
6682823 this highlights that even with extremely high vaccine levels we could have sizable pockets of people contract measles
6682824 similar to whats happening in israel it could result in much higher outbreaks than we have now
6682825 one of the reasons that some parents have withheld measles vaccines is they believe that the risk is very low
6682826 i think that publicity about concerns about the safety of vaccines has contributed to parents delaying or deferring the vaccine for their children
6682827 unfortunately parents are not considering the risks of the disease

6682832 were determined to treat children within our immigration system with fairness and compassion thats why the majority stay in detention for a week or less
6682833 often children are only detained when their parents try to frustrate the removal process detention then becomes necessary to maintain a robust but fair asylum system
6682834 those with no right to be in the uk must return home and last year we removed a person every eight minutes
6682835 the uk border agency will continue to seek alternatives to detention and in the next parliamentary session will adopt a legal duty to promote childrens welfare
6682836 freedom of conscience is not to be surrendered upon issuance of a medical degree

6682839 fails to give assurances that current laws about abortion will not be stretched to cover birth control
6682840 this proposal ensures that doctors and other medical personnel will retain the constitutional right to listen to their own conscience when it comes to performing or participating in an abortion
6682841 these regulations will ensure that pro life medical personnel will not be forced to engage in the unconscionable killing of innocent human life
6682842 nothing in the new regulation in any way changes a patients right to any legal procedure
6682843 its about abortion and conscience it is very closely focused on abortion and physicians conscience
6682844 this regulation does not limit patient access to health care but rather protects any individual health care provider or institution from being compelled to participate in or from being punished for refusal to participate in a service that for example violates their conscience
6682845 lo que parec a ser un impresionante enga o por parte de pol ticos en bruselas llega a tal punto que la imagen de los biocombustibles cambi en un periodo de meses de salvadores del clima a forajidos del clima
6682846 miembros del parlamento europeo votaron para reducir de forma significativa las metas de promoci n de biocombustibles ante evidencias crecientes de sus impactos en el precio de los alimentos en los pueblos y en la biodiversidad y de su incapacidad para combatir el cambio clim tico
6682847 es como si esos cient ficos imaginasen que los biocombustibles fuesen cultivados en estacionamientos
6682848 la mayor a de los estudios anteriores descubri que sustituir gasolina por biocombustibles podr a reducir la emisi n de carbono esos an lisis no consideraron las emisiones de carbono que se producen cuando agricultores en todo el mundo responden al incremento de precios y convierten bosques y pastos en nuevas plantaciones para sustituir cultivos de granos que fueron utilizados para los biocombustibles
6682849 bosques y pastos guardan mucho carbono por lo tanto no hay como conseguir beneficios al transformar esas tierras en cultivos para biocombustibles
6682850 m s deforestaci n m s conflicto m s emisiones de carbono m s cambios clim ticos y menos prosperidad para todos
6682851 diversos centros de investigaci n y la mayor parte de los grupos ecol gicos y de derechos humanos emiten a diario declaraciones afirmando que los biocombustibles no contribuyen a combatir los cambios clim ticos que provocan graves impactos ambientales en regiones de alto valor ecol gico alteran el precio de los alimentos y que consolidan un modelo agr cola de explotaci n laboral y alta dependencia de grandes multinacionales

6682887 the biggest thing when you have people returning especially someone like graham in a position of leadership is it helps to springboard your offseason i think that he provided a certain amount of direction in the offseason the efforts of your players you hope are going in the right direction ours were and i think its a result of returning guys like him

6682889 its got chainsaws woodpeckers people scratching on chalkboards and all that
6682890 so that players cant talk among themselves and they have to execute their plays non verbally
6682891 is incorrect because only are based on mathematical models and presented results at scenarios that do not include for example solar activity
6682892 so that in two years or so there will be a small ice age that lasts from 60 to 80 years
6682893 summer heat continues in short supply continuing a trend that has dominated much of the 21st centurys opening decade
6682894 there have been only 162 days 90 degrees or warmer at midway airport over the period from 2000 to 2008 thats by far the fewest 90 degree temperatures in the opening nine years of any decade on record here since 1930
6682895 the suns surface has been fairly blank for the last couple of years and that has some worried that it may be entering another maunder minimum the suns 50 year abstinence from sunspots which some scientists have linked to the little ice age of the 17th century
6682896 based on the past armagh measurements this suggests that over the next two decades global temperatures may fall by about 2 degrees c that is to a level lower than any we have seen in the last 100 years
6682897 this summers forecast and unusual early melting events all around the arctic serve as a dire warning of how quickly the polar regions are being affected by climate change
6682898 if norways average temperature this year equals that in 2007 the ice cap in the arctic will all melt away which is highly possible judging from current conditions
6682899 the arctic did not experience the meltdowns forecast by nsidc and the norwegian polar year secretariat it didnt even come close additionally some current graphs and press releases from nsidc seem less than conservative there appears to be a consistent pattern of overstatement related to arctic ice loss

6682963 yet another joyous cathartic and noise blistered flashpoint in a narrative already riddled with them the el rey did indeed feel like part of a larger story part of the bands appeal to fans beyond inserting subversively literate lyrics into accessible postpunk and new wave is in the sense of mythology that the group generates not in any numb node rust crusted classic rock sense of keening pretentious or self important melodrama and zoso d mystery but simply in the fact that airbornes live performances act almost as chapters in an overarching arc one that concerns the giddy liberation from fear and loss via dance rippled rock n roll
6682964 given the regions dependence on airlift the most daunting issues facing the caribbean hotel industry are the rising cost of airfares and the announced cutbacks in air service
6682965 due mostly to the rising cost of fuel four of the five leading air carriers to the caribbean have announced cutbacks in service puerto rico and the dominican republic could see as many as 26 percent fewer flights in december of 2008 compared to december 2007
6682966 the caribbean has always been attractive to price sensitive travelers if airfares continue to rise hotels may have to reduce their room rates in an effort to maintain the caribbeans position as an affordable destination
6682967 despite the strength of the market we have seen shifts in the cruise industry that have been influenced by the rising cost of fuel cruises to more remote ports in the southern caribbean such as aruba are being cut from itineraries due to the length of the trip and fuel required to get there
6682968 to preserve the natural beauty of the region caribbean resorts have had a long history of being environmentally friendly
6682969 hotel operators are now parlaying this experience into energy conservation in addition to installing cost cutting equipment such as efficient light bulbs showers toilets sinks and air conditioning caribbean hoteliers are working with their local energy providers to develop new sustainable technologies this will not only reduce the cost of operations but improve the overall economy of the island on which they operate
6682970 if you profile the hotel projects that are currently under construction there youll find a preponderance of luxury and upper upscale properties
6682971 like the recent trend in the united states most of these projects are resorts with a significant residential component and first class spa
6682972 belize and costa rica are two markets that are becoming increasingly competitive with the caribbean as a vacation destination for u s citizens as well as travelers from europe and south america
6682973 historically caribbean hotels have enjoyed the benefit of paying their employees relatively low salaries and wages however due to rising standards of living among the islands we have started to see a closing of the gap between u s and caribbean labors costs
6682974 because of their isolated locations hotels in the caribbean need to import the majority of their food and beverage items accordingly the profit margins in this department are lower than would be expected within the united states
6682975 in addition caribbean insurance costs continue to exceed the u s average due to the constant risk of hurricanes
6682976 recent days have dramatically and worryingly illustrated the threat posed to the lives of police officers by dissident republicans

6682999 the stunning success of northern irelands young people once again demonstrates the dangerous folly of minister ruanes ideological crusade against northern irelands education system

6683001 however it is incredibly sobering to consider that this success story is threatened by the hard left ideological fantasies of the sinn fein education minister why would an education minister even contemplate wrecking a schools system that so dramatically out performs the rest of the uk

6683022 wir best rken die chinesische regierung darin respekt f r menschenrechte zu demonstrieren darunter auch rede und religionsfreiheit aller menschen w hrend der olympischen spiele und dar ber hinaus
6683023 wir haben nur davon geh rt aber hatten keine m glichkeit das zu berpr fen also wissen wir es nicht
6683024 my name is joe i make a living by taking funny and embarrassing pictures and selling them to newspapers magazines and websites you know like someone picking their nose or men walking with their zipper undone
6683025 i will give you 5000 and that is it i can have you killed for 10 000 so 25k is out of question
6683026 there will be no meeting go to the city swimming pool on go to locker 234 the combination is 21 32 36 inside you will find your money once you have counted the money put all the evidence in the locker and leave do not look back
6683027 we do come across cases like these once in a while he either thinks that you still have something on him or he just does not want you to have the satisfaction of getting away with his money
6683028 first of all you committed a crime by blackmailing him and not helping out the law you should be arrested for that
6683029 for how long though you have no evidence and chances are he did not leave any trail we will be forced to free you instead i can help you if you are willing to help me
6683030 well i can provide you police protection this way if anyone tries to injure you we can catch the person and get more information on the killers i know you turned over the evidence but can you identify the two men our sketch artist can make a sketch of them and we can track them down this way
6683031 i handed him my camera and i dont recall their faces very well but i would try would i be safe though
6683032 dont worry you will be guarded 24 hours a day
6683033 i gave you some time but you did not call me i have no choice but to turn over the evidence to the police they might reward me or give me some recognition
6683034 well joe the sketches were of no help and in the last three months you have not been attacked so we have no choice but to take the police protection away just be on a lookout for something fishy and call me immediately if you notice anything suspicious
6683035 honey here is another one this ad just got posted they want to sell a 5 month old bmw valued at 40 000 for 5000 something is up there lets call the party

6683037 we want to improve our debt equity ratio and the rights issue would help us achieve this
6683038 winning the next election mattered more to him than taking tough action
6683039 that obvious incapacity is what has characterised his first 100 days in office giving him the inescapable hallmark of failure
6683040 he was able to convince the public that he was a tough talking action man when in fact he was slavishly colluding in s policy of appeasement
6683041 wilfully ignored the underlying trends that have brought this country to its knees
6683042 mr cowens challenge was clear to cut inflation and protect irelands hard won competitiveness but winning the next election mattered more to him than taking tough action
6683043 as with taxes so with spending for three years running 2005 to 2007 when the housing sector was already overheated and when the
6683044 he lashed out money at rates that were way above the growth rate of the economy
6683045 but he continued down the path of self delusion and national misinformation and he accused anybody who told the truth of national sabotage
6683046 infamous route of advising the mortgaged poor to tighten their belts further to make up for a decade of government inaction
6683047 like i said before the dream is coming true this is fantastic
6683048 this is my scene the pressure was on me he has beaten me four times before and he is strong he has such raw strength
6683049 but i got through it my training my tactics were perfect it was all spot on
6683050 one of them is territorial integrity we are here at the security council as i said yesterday georgia has a history at the security council and all previous resolutions of the security council on georgia have reaffirmed the commitment of all member states to the sovereignty territorial integrity and independence of georgia
6683051 the second element which is crucial is addressing the text in a way conducive to consensus the modalities whereby russian forces would remain after the withdrawal and pending the establishment of an international mechanism
6683052 some were asking in consultation today why there is no reference to territorial integrity on our draft resolution our draft resolution again is the repetition a reconfirmation of the six principles
6683053 and you know what there is no territorial integrity in the six principles so if we stick to the six principles which were adopted by the two presidents there is not supposed to be any reference in the resolution to territorial integrity
6683054 the fact is that what we see now on the ground is a reflection of the ambiguities that could be helped immensely by the clarifications that have already been expressed by president sarkozy
6683055 the french draft resolution doesnt address those the draft again doesnt address anything about territorial integrity neither do the six points but that doesnt mean that the european union which has articulated its position in a communique somehow doesnt agree with the territorial integrity of georgia and the need to reaffirm it
6683056 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6683057 my suggestion is that all obstetric units across this country remove t3s tylenol 3 from their obstetric formulary
6683058 ive actually contacted the hospital leadership at bc womens hospital asking that it be yanked completely so we no longer have it available
6683059 we dont want to panic people here theres kind of a warning bell going out there but we need a lot more studies to see it
6683060 the general advice is to take the smallest dose possible
6683061 the safety of patients who use our products is a priority for the company
6683062 tylenol 3 prescription tylenol with codeine is a safe and effective product when used according to the approved prescribing information
6683063 this recent revelation about codeine is of concern because codeine has always been pretty much treated rather casually
6683064 probably the best advice to people is to be very cautious about using compounds that contain codeine
6683065 in my own practice if someone needs codeine i think hard about it and make sure there is no other cause for that amount of pain
6683066 in my own clinical experience they new mothers can manage without it
6683067 la tecnologia quando non piattaforma abilitante della comunicazione non serve a niente
6683068 the groups profit performance in the first half of the year was strong despite the general economic tightening in the united states and western europe
6683069 the prospects for 2009 remain less certain particularly if the us and western european economies continue to be impacted by the financial crisis
6683070 it felt great to win i was over the moon
6683071 the judges are amazing so to impress them enough is probably the best thing about it
6683072 dancing just feels natural and i practise anything between about six and 20 hours a week
6683073 i have my own style and i hope to inspire others rather than aspire to be like someone else
6683074 ill probably spend the prize money on shoes and hats
6683075 part of the prize was entry and accommodation for the british street dance championships at brean sands in somerset in february so im looking forward to that
6683076 hopefully ill have a career as a choreographer but i enjoy boxing as well so im going to keep working on both
6683077 yes absolutely and i think its the games for nintendo
6683078 i think whatever price theyre at i think its the games that have really really driven it
6683079 we started off at the beginning of the year with gt5 prologue then we went to gta iv then metal gear solid therell be littlebigplanet and then we move onto pes and fifa and all those
6683080 were on rails and i think that those games are going to drive it
6683081 i really like the combination of analysis behind the news that gamesindustry biz provides it taps into the brains and emotions of so many industry constituencies developers and publishers of course but also manufacturers government and financial players with so much volatility these days its important to be fully advised as well as informed highly recommended
6683082 we dont have the details yet to know if these cases are in jeopardy so i cant speak on that publicly yet
6683083 fachpsychiatrisches attest auf unterbringung in einem psychiatrischen krankenhaus zur vorlage bei der zust ndigen polizeibeh rde
6683084 people should not be forced to say or do things they believe are morally wrong
6683085 nothing in this rule that would in any way change a patients right to a legal procedure
6683086 many people would sooner die than think in fact they do so
6683087 vivir en la oscuridad no significa que tengan una vida

6683093 no se puede ver la incidencia directa es dif cil pero hay que seguir investigando
6683094 it is unpleasant to remember these anniversaries but we must do it in order not to repeat past mistakes
6683095 unlike in may 1945 no one welcomed soviet tanks in prague in august 1968
6683096 tanks then in 1968 were not fighting an enemy but a political idea and this is a sign of weakness
6683097 the russian army still occupies our territory in spite of the numerous agreements concluded a week ago
6683098 demand for this kind of products has increased markedly over the past two years but their share in total sales is still relatively low
6683099 the money will be used for development of it centres in brno and ostrava
6683100 at the moment i see no date which the government could responsibly declare as the year of euro adoption
6683101 i am an optimist in this respect because our economy has good preconditions to grow
6683102 in addition to this from the year 2010 on our inflation target will be at 2 percent
6683103 this will depend in particular on the crowns rate and demand pressures from the real economy
6683104 gb will provide non life insurance and cooperate with home credit as we are already doing in russia ukraine and kazakhstan
6683105 one of them is a principle of equal partnership that is number parity representation on all bodies of the company
6683106 it would be logical if the stake corresponded to the size of the two companies
6683107 it as an aggression an attack on free thinking and on free decision making
6683108 di bulan ramadhan ada lima hal yang diberikan kepada ummatku dan tidak diberikan kepada ummat para nabi sebelumku pertama setiap memasuki malam di bulan ramadhan allah swt memandang mereka dan setiap orang yang dipandang oleh allah ia tidak akan diazab oleh nya kedua ketika memasuki sore hari bahu mulut mereka lebih harum dari kasturi di sisi allah ketiga para malaikat memohonkan ampunan untuk mereka setiap hari dan malam keempat allah azza wa jalla berfirman kepada surga nya berhiaslah dan persiapkan kamu untuk peristirahatan hamba hamba ku dari kelelahan dan penderitaan dunia agar mereka berada di rumah kemulian ku kelima pada akhir malam bulan ramadhan allah azza wa jalla mengampuni semua dosa dosa mereka
6683109 bukan tidakkah kamu melihat betapa besar pahala orang orang yang beramal baik
6683110 sesungguhnya puasa itu bukan hanya menahan diri dari makan dan minum jika kamu berpuasa hendaknya kamu menjaga lisanmu dari dusta memejamkan pandanganmu dari yang diharamkan oleh allah jangan saling berbantahan jangan saling menghasud jangan saling menggunjing jangan melakukan perpecahan jangan saling berselisih pendapat dalam kebohongan bahkan dalam kebenaran jangan saling memaki jangan saling mencaci jangan berlaku zalim jangan saling mengatakan bodoh jangan bosan dan lalai untuk berzikir kepada allah dan shalat bersikaplah diam sabar jujur menghindari orang orang yang buruk jauhi perkataan dusta permusuhan buruk sangka menggunjing adu domba jadilah kamu orang yang mulia hingga saat saat hadirnya shahibuz zaman sa sebagaimana yang telah dijanjikan oleh allah sebagai bekal untuk men jumpai allah kamu harus bersikap damai dan tenang tunduk dan patuh jadilah seorang hamba yang merendahkan diri di hadapan allah dengan rasa takut dan harap wahai orang yang berpuasa hendaknya kamu mensucikan hatimu dari segala aib sucikan jiwamu dari segala noda dan bersihkan tubuhmu dari segala kotoran berlepaslah diri kepada allah dari musuh musuh nya tuluskan hatimu dalam mencintai nya berpuasalah dari segala larangan nya dalam kesunyian dan terang terangan takutlah kepada allah dengan yang sebenarnya dalam kesunyian dan terang terangan serahkan dirimu kepada allah pada hari hari puasamu kosongkan hatimu untuk nya dan bagilah dirimu untuk nya dalam menjalankan perintah nya dan berdoalah pada nya jika kamu telah menjalankan semua itu maka kamu adalah orang yang berpuasa karena nya dengan puasa yang sebenarnya dan kamu benar benar menjalankan apa yang diperintahkan padamu tetapi jika sedikit saja kamu menguranginya maka kamu telah mengurangi puasamu sesuai dengan kadar penguranganmu
6683111 rasulullah saw pernah mendengar seorang perempuan yang memaki pembantunya lalu rasulullah saw memanggilnya dengan membawa makanan dan berkata
6683112 bagaimana kamu berpuasa sementara kamu memaki pembantumu sesungguhnya puasa itu tidak hanya menahan diri dari makan dan minum tetapi allah menjadikan puasa itu juga menahan diri dari selain itu yaitu dari perbuatan dan ucapan yang keji alangkah lebih sedikitnya nilai puasamu dan lebih banyak kadar laparmu
6683113 wahai jabir bulan ini adalah bulan ramadhan barangsiapa yang berpuasa pada siang harinya dan berwirid di malam harinya menjaga perut dan kemaluannya serta menjaga lisannya niscaya ia keluar dari dosa dosanya seperti ia keluar dari bulan ini
6683114 sesungguhnya orang yang memberi buka kepada orang yang berpuasa ia memperoleh pahala tanpa mengurangi pahalanya dan dan memperoleh pahala kebaikan yang ia lakukan
6683115 sesungguhnya seorang mukmin yang memberi sesuap makanan kepada mukmin yang lain di bulan ramadhan allah akan mencatat baginya seperti pahala orang yang memerdekakan tiga puluh budak yang beriman dan doanya akan diterima di sisi allah swt
6683116 bulan ramadhan adalah bulan yang agung di dalamnya allah melipatgandakan kebaikan menghapuskan keburukan meninggikan derajat barangsiapa yang bersedekah di bulan ini allah mengampuni dosa dosanya barangsiapa yang berbuat baik sampai memerdekakan budaknya allah mengampuni dosa dosanya
6683117 sesungguhnya bulanmu ini tidak seperti bulan bulan yang lain jika bulan ini datang kepadamu ia datang dengan membawa keberkahan dan rahmat jika meninggalkanmu ia meninggalkan dengan membawa dosa dosamu di bulan ini kebaikan dilipatgandakan dan amal yang baik diterima barangsiapa yang melakukan shalat sunnah dua rakaat di dalamnya allah mengampuni dosa dosanya
6683118 orang yang benar benar celaka adalah orang yang keluar dari bulan ini tetapi dosa dosanya tidak diampuni ketika itulah ia menjadi orang yang rugi saat orang orang yang baik memperoleh keuntungan dari tuhan yang maha mulia
6683119 hendaknya kamu memperbanyak doa dan istighfar di bulan ramadhan karena sesungguhnya doa dapat menahan bala dan istighfar dapat menghapuskan dosa
6683120 barangsiapa yang membaca doa ini doa ahli kubur setiap sesudah shalat fardhu di bulan ramadhan allah akan mengampuni dosa dosanya sampai hari kiamat
6683121 sesungguhnya allah dan para malaikat nya bershalawat kepada orang orang yang beristighfar dan yang makan sahur di waktu sahur
6683122 sesungguhnya allah azza wa jalla mencintai setiap doa dari hamba hamba nya yang beriman maka hendaknya kalian berdoa di waktu sahur sampai terbit matahari karena saat saat itu adalah saat dibukanya pintu pintu langit dibagikannya rizki dan ditunaikannya hajat hajat yang besar
6683123 sesungguhnya allah azza wa jalla jika ia hendak menimpakan suatu azab kepada penduduk bumi ia menyatakan sekiranya tidak ada orang orang yang mencintai keagungan ku meramaikan masjid ku dan beristighfar di waktu sahur niscaya aku turunkan azab ku
6683124 sekiranya kalian mengetahui apa yang akan kamu dapatkan di bulan ramadhan niscaya kamu akan menambah rasa syukur kalian kepada allah swt
6683125 sungguh aku telah mengampuni mereka dan bapak bapak mereka aku akan lindungi mereka dari azab hari kiamat
6683126 wahai ummat muhammad aku adalah tuhan dan kalian adalah hamba ku bernaunglah kalian di bawah arasy ku di menaramenara ini makan dan minumlah sepuas kalian jangan takut dan jangan sedih wahai ummat muhammad demi kemuliaan dan keagungan ku aku akan mengirim kalian ke surga kalian akan dibanggakan oleh orang orang yang terdahulu dan yang terakhir aku akan memberikan pada setiap kalian seribu mahkota dari cahaya kendaraan onta yang kuciptakan dari cahaya tali kendalinya dari cahaya dan pada tali kendali itu terdapat seribulingkaran yang terbuat dari emas dan pada setiap lingkaran berdiri malaikat dan setiap malaikat memegang tongkat dari cahaya sehingga kalian memasuki surga tanpa dihisab allah swt memandang kalian dengan kasih sayang nya kemudian mengampuni semua dosa kalian kecuali sogokan dan hartanya allah swt mensucikan rumah kalian setiap hari tujuh puluh ribu kali dari ghibah dan dusta kalian seperti menolong setiap mukmin dan mukminah memberi pakaian pada tujuh puluh ribu orang yang telanjang membantu seribu orang yang menjalin tali persaudaraan kalian seperti membaca semua kitab yang diturunkan oleh allah azza wa jalla kepada para nabi nya allah azza wa jalla menjadikan bagi kalian di surga al khuld seratus ribu kota dari cahaya memberi kalian di surga seratus ribu istana dari perak memberi kalian di surga al jalal tiga ratus ribu mimbar tempat yang tinggi yang terbuat dari misik di setiap mimbar seribu rumah dari zafaran di setiap rumah terdapat tempat tidur yang terbuat dari permata putih dan permata merah dan di setiap tempat tidur disiapkan pasangan bidadari allah azza wa jalla memberi kalian beribu ribu kediaman dan di setiap kediaman terdapat menara putih di setiap menara terdapat tempat tidur dari kafur putih dilengkapi dengan seribu permadani dari sutera hijau di setiap permadani disiapkan bidadari yang dihiasi dengan tujuh puluh ribu hiasan di kepalanya seribu hiasan dari permata putih dan permata merah allah azza wa jalla mencatat bagi kalian setiap hari sebelumnya pahala seribu suhada dan seribu orang yang benar allah azza wa jalla mencatat bagi kalian seperti beribadah lima puluh tahun allah azza wa jalla mencatat bagi kalian untuk setiap hari seperti puasa dua ribu hari dan mengangkat derajat kalian setinggi derajat orang orang yang mulia allah azza wa jalla mencatat bagi kalian keselamatan dari neraka dan melintasi shirath dan keamanan dari azab di surga ada sebuah pintu yang tidak dibuka hingga hari kiamat kemudian dibukakan untuk orang orang yang puasa laki laki dan perempuan dari ummat muhammad saw kemudian penjaga surga malaikat ridhwan memanggil wahai ummat muhammad kamarilah kalian ke pintu ini kemudian ummatku masuk ke pintu itu menuju ke surga barangsiapa yang tidak diampuni di bulan ramadhan maka bulan yang mana ia akan diampuni tiada daya dan kekuatan kecuali dengan allah yang maha mulia dan maha agung
6683127 for me russians were also victims of the brutal communist totalitarian regime and i personally feel no hatred to them
6683128 it is rather that someone is constantly pushing us on these different sides of the barricade
6683129 yes russia is different than we are we have a different political system a different measure of political pluralism and a different level of democracy
6683130 it is not directed against russia and no one should interpret it so
6683131 it was the expansive communism that fundamentally trampled our sovereignty
6683132 we cannot turn a blind eye on it and pretend it does not exist this new system is completely strange and it is at the same time connected with certain expansionism it is not a mere coincidence when putin says the split of the soviet union was a disaster and that he would like this whole to be restored in another way
6683133 this system is based on a certain kind of cohesion between political and economic power
6683134 the radar will be an expression of our bilateral union with the united states i know nothing about whether the radar has a real sense whether it will work well or not or whether it the united states will thereby achieve its goals or not i do not think it is up to me or us the czechs to be able to assess it
6683135 if we together dont work for finding ways to take away the obstacles of legal downloads then this industry from a digital perspective is going to die
6683136 had we only done music we wouldnt have done this
6683137 the way it is set up today very few people apart from the record industry are getting rich on digital music generally speaking the music today isnt generating a boat load of cash for us
6683138 the volume of deals in the first half was negatively affected by the ongoing crisis of the real estate and financial sectors mainly in the usa and the expectation of a recession in the us economy with possible global impacts this was enhanced by growing prices of oil and energies and fears of the growing inflation and for company profits
6683139 botezul cu duhul sf nt al credinciosilor este dovedit cu semnul imediat concret si vizibil al vorbirii n alte limbi

6683141 au devenit acum un ingredient esential al vietii mele de rug ciune
6683142 sunt adesea dar nu ntotdeauna primele care se dob ndesc pentru multi ele devin astfel un prag dincolo de care se obtin darurile si roadele duhului sf nt
6683143 n timpurile de la nceput duhul sf nt se rev rsa peste cei ce credeau iar ei vorbeau n limbi pe care nu le nv taser c ci duhul le d dea lor s gr iasc acestea erau semne adaptate la acele vremi c ci cu dreptate trebuia s fie acest semn al duhului sf nt pentru toate limbile pentru a se ar ta evanghelia lui hristos la toate neamurile si n toate limbile de pe fata p m ntului acea vorbire n limbi a fost un semn al lui dumnezeu care mai apoi ns a trecut

6683145 rosteam adesea silabe f r sens n efortul de a mi provoca fluxul rug ciunii n limbi

6683155 em seus c lculos o mestre contador de kublai khan estimara sessenta luas novas sem not cias do mercador de veneza
6683156 contudo naquele primeiro final de tarde ap s sua jornada ao levante o loquaz marco parecia estranhamente amofinado atitude na qual o khan percebeu lhe alguma dissimula o pois o italiano irradiava uma esquisita mas luminosa express o luzimento potenciado pelo c u que ardia em cores alaranjadas e p rpuras e pelo perfume de rom s maduros do jardim onde aves do para so alvoro adas com o poente gorjeavam o an ncio da noite

6683158 aqui o impaciente khan interrompeu o chasqueando que estava farto de relatos sobre cidades invis veis como antioquina teod sia cleopatr polis e italianices quetais e a prop sito desde quando se interessava por mulheres
6683159 distra do pela s bita presen a da cortes que lhes serve o ch cujas curvas intui sob as dobras do s ri e cujo perfume almiscarado gotejando dos seios fartos lhe inebria os sentidos marco polo fixa o horizonte como se buscasse no c u as coordenadas para seu piloto
6683160 o autor do poema descreve uma coisa movendo se das sand lias acima pelo ventre at os seios da amada notou marco
6683161 contou me polo cousas que parecem inventadas n meros assombrosos at mesmo o mundo do pecado dentro das muralhas de khanabalik ele contou 20 mil prostitutas tratadas com respeito pela corte e o povo
6683162 embora chabi fosse a prima dona que trouxera os mestres budistas do tibet corte kublai tinha quatro esposas e numerosas concubinas dentro do pal cio
6683163 segredou me polo que por ele se enrabichara khutulun sobrinha do khan que descreve t o brava e forte que em todo o ex rcito de seu pai n o havia homem que lhe fosse p reo seus pais estavam preocupados porque at a idade dos 23 anos n o se casara mas ela advertiu que s consentiria num casamento se fosse vencida em combate por algum jovem que lhe desse 100 cavalos em garantia era t o imbat vel guerreira que em pouco tempo amealhou 10 mil cavalos seu ltimo pretendente lhe deixara 1 mil cavalos e retirara se humilhado at seu caminho cruzar se com o do veneziano que guerreiro n o era mas bem dotado de outras virtudes

6683204 i was in a collectors shop which dealt mostly baseball cards and comics but had a small box of postcards on the counter the card showed all of the department stores up north on washington avenue
6683205 the coffee going into the cup is all in lights its just a really neat card depicting the 1950s store
6683206 an elderly man called to ask me if i had a postcard of antines he and his wife were both newport news high school graduates and had gone on their first date there they had a special anniversary coming up and he wanted to surprise her with the card so i sent him one
6683207 when you read the cards the messages are telling you stories
6683208 you get to see and hear about how things once were which oftentimes ends up other than something you originally thought
6683209 i love buckroe beach cards people came from everywhere to enjoy the beach and amusement park i know i spent a lot of time there it was like the busch gardens of that day
6683210 i especially remember going on the merry go round as a child i loved it i would be so excited and pay more than i should if i ever came across a card with the merry go round on it
6683211 there are always people who are going to enjoy history
6683212 if i couldnt leave my house i would never be bored
6683213 i spend hours in my museum room looking at all the cards and other memorabilia ive collected over the years my walls are covered from floor to ceiling with stuff
6683214 im a member of the hampton roads postcard club and i spoke to a local rotary club about postcards once
6683215 i broke all the rules for speaking and ended up sharing for over an hour when i was done a member came up to me and said he could listen to this all night because they were things he grew up with

6683253 the game has changed and the way the game is played has to be changed
6683254 while child welfare services had improved an immigration removal centre can never be a suitable place for children and we were dismayed to find cases of disabled children being detained and some children spending large amounts of time incarcerated
6683255 any period of detention can be detrimental to children and their families but the impact of lengthy detention is particularly extreme
6683256 which was not surprising given the sometimes traumatic circumstances in which many had initially been detained
6683257 we found examples in the recent past of children with disabilities who ought not to have been detained

6683272 freedom of conscience is not to be surrendered upon issuance of a medical degree

6683274 womens ability to manage their own health care is at risk of being compromised by politics and ideology
6683275 fails to give assurances that current laws about abortion will not be stretched to cover birth control
6683276 this proposal ensures that doctors and other medical personnel will retain the constitutional right to listen to their own conscience when it comes to performing or participating in an abortion
6683277 these regulations will ensure that pro life medical personnel will not be forced to engage in the unconscionable killing of innocent human life
6683278 the money thats gone into waste fraud and abuse under these contracts 23 billion is just so outrageous its so egregious it may well turn out to be the largest war profiteering in history
6683279 ultimately this story of the first star is the beginning story of our own existence
6683280 our body contains carbon oxygen and so on these elements did not exist in the early universe we are here because these elements were synthesized in stars
6683281 this mind boggling endeavor is made possible by the extraordinary simplicity of the early universe
6683282 what we see in these very faint fluctuations are the seeds of structure in the universe
6683283 that is what yoshidas group used for their initial conditions to study the formation of the first objects in the universe how we went from almost featureless gas to gas that has structure and ultimately to massive stars and galaxies
6683284 compared to the age of the universe that is the blink of an eye
6683285 these stars the first stars were rather different from the stars like the sun we see today
6683286 the confirmed presence of the virus in our mosquito population is not surprising
6683287 since birds are most susceptible to the virus the surveillance program includes the collection and testing of dead birds for wnv as well the gathering and assessment of adult mosquito pools
6683288 to date we have had no human cases of west nile virus within our county
6683289 most mosquitoes do not transmit disease however it is a good idea to take steps that can help reduce your risk of being bitten
6683290 beyond the strip inside the world of comics manga and graphic novels
6683291 comics tend to slip into the background and big budget movies bring them to the foreground and get people excited again
6683292 the marketing scheme of big comic book publishers are killing comics
6683293 the book has gone from selling one copy every couple of weeks to 15 copies a day just because of an advertisement at the beginning of the batman movie
6683294 manga has amazing character development and it keeps you thinking just as much as novels do
6683295 itis so tiring because we pack such a lot in
6683296 this was the eighth time that we have been invited but of course its not the same kids who go every year for the new ones going for the first time it was a lovely experience
6683297 everyone was so excited and couldnt wait to get there
6683298 i think it was better the second time because the girls whod been before werent as nervous as the first time they went
6683299 it went really well and they were on a high when they finished their performance they then enjoyed a look round the park and are hoping they will be able to go back again next year
6683300 we are replacing our static per keyword quality scores with a system that will evaluate an ads quality each time it matches a search query this way adwords will use the most accurate specific and up to date performance information when determining whether an ad should be displayed
6683301 the once every four years hope for the lever pull sensation of democratic power blinds people to the opportunities for democratic representation deliberation activism and change that surrounds us in local elections
6683302 bad for democracy how the presidency undermines the power of the people
6683303 even the best presidents need social movements to accomplish transformational change
6683304 fdr could not have succeeded without the agitation of the unemployed workers councils and the unions and lbjs greatest accomplishments were made possible by the civil rights movement
6683305 it is in vain to summon a people which has been rendered so dependent on the central power to choose from time to time the representatives of that power
6683306 this rare and brief exercise of their free choice however important it may be will not prevent them from gradually losing the faculties of thinking feeling and acting for themselves and thus gradually falling below the level of humanity

6683322 theres a lot that very powerful and positive about it jamaica has had a tough time and to see so much good coming out of jamaica is wonderful and to see all of this raw talent with so many of them having done their training in jamaica its just a wonderful feeling for the people of jamaica and the people of the caribbean words cant express

6683353 public figures like michael phelps exert a major influence over our youngsters
6683354 mr phelps is a superior athlete by any measure but his judgment regarding the mcdonalds and kelloggs frosted flakes endorsements was either 1 ill advised by his handlers 2 the irrational product of too much blood sugar or 3 a sad triumph of greed over good ciof believes that celebrities should think twice before choosing to endorse or encourage the consumption of any product which is inherently unhealthful to children especially if that product is correlated to obesity diabetes and a myriad of dangerous conditions
6683355 octagon sports agent peter carlisle is making a strategic branding mistake by aligning michael phelps to kelloggs frosted flakes and mcdonalds in this era of escalating child obesity and diabetes the last association michael phelps wants is that of junk food pusher
6683356 while michael phelps may consume thousands of calories a day and burn them off through olympic training americas kids arent so fat sickly and have little hope of accomplishing a single sit up much less olympic gold kids are watching and michael phelps going for the quick cash of pushing junk food at the expense of children tarnishes his image similar to an association with cigarettes or alcohol would national action against obesity and the childrens international obesity foundation implore michael phelps and all celebrities and athletes to reject offers to push more sugar fat and hazardous calories onto americas kids
6683357 as we set out to look at the causes of obesity in our film
6683358 this is unconscionable and we hope that michael phelps reconsiders his endorsement contracts
6683359 because children under five deserve environments full of healthy options not marketing venues for junk food producers

6683363 maybe he was too nice he kept himself to himself he didnt get involved in trouble
6683364 yarls wood is to be congratulated on sustaining reasonable performance in many areas despite the upheavals of the change of management and reduction in staff numbers however significant concerns remain particularly the lack of activity for detainees which is a failure that we have identified across the immigration detainee estate even more worrying was the plight of children detained for increasing periods of time and with insufficient provision to meet their needs yarls wood must seek to meet these concerns but they are ultimately issues for the uk border agency which must urgently address them
6683365 were determined to treat children within our immigration system with fairness and compassion thats why the majority stay in detention for a week or less
6683366 often children are only detained when their parents try to frustrate the removal process detention then becomes necessary to maintain a robust but fair asylum system those with no right to be in the uk must return home and last year we removed a person every eight minutes

6683371 combined hrt improves sleep aches and pains and sexual functioning these gains can now be factored in to a womans choice to use combined hrt
6683372 this benefit must be weighed against the overall short and long term risks which must be individualised for women based on years since menopause medical history and chosen regimen further research with appropriate measures is needed to assess more fully the impact of combined hrt on all aspects of health related quality of life for postmenopausal women
6683373 the increased risk of serious diseases including breast cancer coronary heart disease and blood clots with the use of combined oestrogen and progesterone therapy is now well established
6683374 despite the global downturn flattening the growth of personal debt and uk gdp over the past few quarters debt levels continue to grow at a faster rate than the income the uk generates
6683375 although there is no cause for panic as personal debt is well covered by the uk housing stock the figures clearly illustrate the continuing problem of growing personal debt levels in the uk

6683377 pcos isnt just about your ovaries or your medical tests its about the whole of you mind body and spirit whether youre dealing with weight issues struggling with facial hair feeling frustrated with fertility or worrying about your increased risk of diabetes or heart disease theres little doubt that having pcos can prevent you from wholeheartedly embracing your life thats why we decided to write this book weve both got pcos ourselves and weve both used the information and ideas in this book to get our health and lives back on track

6683380 our entire site is dedicated to building healthy and strong families we believe 529 accounts are one of the best tools available to american families for managing the incredible costs of educating their kids

6683384 we are extremely disappointed with the decision made by myspace and fox interactive to delete our account
6683385 myspace was a great way for us to keep in touch with our pool playing friends and customers so the loss of franks myspace page is not an insignificant loss
6683386 as a part of the doral family for over 18 years jim knows every inch of our courses and understands the needs of our guests his redesign will provide enjoyable experience for players of all skill levels
6683387 once completed the silver course will be a championship ready golf course
6683388 moving the course from a par 71 to a par 70 makes it more challenging from championship and professional tees while allowing an amateur friendly course from closer tees it will provide some of the most memorable holes at doral golf resort amp spa easily comparable to those on the blue monster golf course
6683389 we had a big heavy cement septic tank for our fishing camp

6683394 they are trying to find dry land someplace to hide
6683395 we truly regret that they will not take part in this years event they have been a valuable partner in the past and we really appreciate that
6683396 our view is that cpi and cpix under the new system will not be very different to each other
6683397 this does not indicate a big change in the inflation targeting regime whether we are talking about cpi or cpix we expect inflation to fall to 6 7 by the third quarter of next year
6683398 the one thing im a bit worried about is rent inflation toward the end of 2010 which could be above average inflation
6683399 my only concern at this stage is we havent seen how this owner rent series behaves there is a bit of risk there
6683400 i think rents are on their way up and will rise faster than cpi
6683401 a per cia feita pelos sul africanos poderia ter sido feita pela pol cia de investiga o criminal pic que no caso vertente foi proibida tudo leva a crer que n o havia interesse para se chegar verdade mais cedo

6683403 a base da investiga o n o pode ser restrita s aos devedores do banco austral mas sim alargada pois siba siba era um funcion rio do banco central
6683404 um teatro para entreter os doadores que pressionam para que o mesmo seja esclarecido

6683429 again we are always pleased to see an improvement in the foreclosure situation even if it is just a month to month adjustment
6683430 although southern california was hardest hit by the foreclosure crisis the northern part of the state has also been significantly affected but not as much in san francisco even in san francisco though median home prices have declined
6683431 the region has seen prices fall approximately 20 to 25 percent since the middle of 2006
6683432 however median home prices and inventories in northern california have begun to level off in the past few months
6683433 an improvement of over eight percent in southern california is welcome news and hopefully the start of an upward trend
6683434 however riverside and los angeles counties continue to be major contributors to the 120 percent jump from last year
6683435 the housing market indicators show a declining inventory of homes for sale but the median home values also continue to decline
6683436 many areas have seen home values fall over 30 percent since the middle of 2006 during the housing boom without a short sale or a few other options it is nearly impossible to sell a home that was overly leveraged

6683473 but basic questions over the business case for nfc remain and there are sharp differences of opinion on how the market will develop
6683474 in many ways nfc shares similarities with the early days of the smart card industry particularly with the electronic purse
6683475 everyone thought cash would be redundant by now and wed all be using electronic money instead

6683496 the olympics are a special challenge for food producers because athletes demand organic food thats rich in vitamins and minerals and because the olympics food supply is strictly regulated by in country and international olympics committees
6683497 hydroponics allows strict quality control reliable supply environmental benefits and it produces high nutrition crops
6683498 australia wisely chose to rely on hydroponics for its 2000 olympics because soil grown crops could easily have been ruined by adverse weather which is not a problem with hydroponics
6683499 better yet as is the case in north america and europe hydroponics crops cost less to produce and buy than field crops
6683500 the chinese are mastering hydroponics rapidly especially as they produce fruits and vegetables for the 2008 olympics
6683501 in fact the chinese government created a highly regulated guarded organic greenhouse grown plant production infrastructure to guarantee the quantity and quality of the fruit and vegetable supply for olympic athletes and visitors
6683502 fact is organic fruits and vegetables grown hydroponically for the china olympics are packed with vitamins and minerals which means athletes perform better
6683503 and china is able to meet the demands for quality food better than if it was relying on regular soil agriculture healthy organic hydroponics food wins the gold medal at the 2008 china summer olympics in beijing

6683510 the story is a long complicated one winding its way from china to france by way of the first world war the oil cartel the pharmaceutical cartel and iraq to its final destination a syringe full of something claiming to be a vaccine against the newly deadly avian flu
6683511 our best intelligence estimate is that pandemic avian flu has already been created through genetic engineering
6683512 as a physician i understand a basic virological fact that the public has not been told it is impossible to make a vaccine against a virus that does not yet exist public relations efforts to the contrary if a vaccine is being made against the avian flu virus in its pandemic form that means the pandemic virus must already exist so the fact that the avian flu vaccine is already being manufactured in china by sanofi pasteur reported to be a wholly owned subsidiary of total petroleum a french arm of the cartel supports our contention that the weaponized avian flu already exists as we saw in the case of the anthrax scare of 2001 an allegedly disgruntled government employee can release deadly toxins from even the most secure government facility
6683513 publicly available information shows the pharmaceutical industry and us government are both actively preparing for an avian flu pandemic this is shown through their own promotional literature and propaganda
6683514 the whole notion of an avian flu pandemic occurring without technological intervention is highly questionable to date there have only been around 385 human cases of avian flu identified worldwide assuming those identifications are trustworthy of course with 243 deaths to put the absurdity of this effort into perspective sudden cardiac death scd which many researchers believe is heavily associated with aspartame consumption is a leading cause of death according to the cdc for example scd killed 460 000 americans in 1999 and the numbers keep rising www cdc gov mmwr preview mmwrhtml mm5106a3 htm but aspartame a product of monsanto is an approved substance while the currently non pandemic avian flu is the focus of hugely expensive seemingly irrational preparations if there is no intent to create that very pandemic
6683515 given the shockingly obvious lack of any threat from an un weaponized h5n1 virus how can we explain the bush administration spending billions of dollars preparing each of the 50 states for what it drums into us is the
6683516 america and world are facing extreme challenges ahead in regard to energy this conference continues to address many of the energy issues and realities failure to effectively deal with the problems now will threaten our nations economic prosperity compromise our national security and could radically alter our way of life

6683603 speelt het seksisme van het paradijsverhaal een rol in de revolte van de moslimas hun optreden steekt schril af tegen de mannelijke berusting in de traditie en getuigt van een grote existenti le moed die hen dikwijls in de marginaliteit drijft men mag hier zelfs van een wereldwijde vrouwelijke diaspora spreken na de moord op theo van gogh in 2004 werd ayaan hirsi ali door de imam van den haag vogelvrij verklaard ze moest onderduiken en ontvluchtte ten slotte het o zo tolerante holland richting vs
6683604 inzake geloof zijn jonge mensen van belgische afkomst die vandaag uit progressieve zeg maar linkse overtuiging de hoofddoek verdedigen hoofdzakelijk na ef of nee onnozel dat is de term onnozel betekent volgens het groot woordenboek der nederlandse taal onschuldig zonder kennis van de wereld en dus licht te bedriegen inderdaad die jonge mensen hebben geen flauw benul van de immense wurgende kracht die een eeuwenoude wereldgodsdienst ontwikkelt zodra hij op een grens stuit die hem van buitenaf wordt gesteld bovendien vinden ze die djellabas en hoofddoeken toch maar wat exotisch
6683605 en kom me niet zeggen dat de islam beter is dan het katholicisme op die basis is elk debat elke uitwisseling van aan elkaar gewaagde standpunten onmogelijk
6683606 er is nog iets anders wat we dringend moeten doen en dat is onze verhouding met amerika herzien
6683607 en ten slotte moet het duidelijk zijn dat een wereld die nog steeds lijdt aan de wonden van de eeuwenlange westerse agressies van het kolonialisme en het imperialisme en nog altijd fundamenteel onrechtvaardig georganiseerd is de ideale voedingsbodem is voor allerlei vormen van terrorisme zij die dat betwisten door te wijzen op het feit dat de meeste terroristen geen arme drommels zijn maar vaak hoogopgeleide intellectuelen met westerse of andere diplomas hebben niet begrepen dat deze fundamentalisten geen schijn van kans zouden hebben in een wereld waarin alle mensen eindelijk aan hun trekken zouden komen en waarin armoede ongeletterdheid en kansloosheid als even grote misdaden worden beschouwd als bijvoorbeeld vroeger de slavernij
6683608 de vlaamse khadijas zijn noodgedwongen discreet halen zelden de media maar ze bestaan wel degelijk ze vormen naar vrouwen en mannen toe allochtoon of niet het onomstotelijke bewijs van het khadija fenomeen de sterke vrouw die er op louter individuele kracht in slaagt om ondanks alle tegenwerking van familie en gemeenschap een eigen toekomst op te bouwen de toekomst van de moslimas ligt in hun eigen handen en niet in de handen van god of van de allochtone gemeenschap
6683609 moslims moeten andere moslims leren dat het mogelijk is om toch een goeie gelovige te zijn zonder daarbij de europese traditie af te zweren her en der verrijzen stilaan aarzelende schuchtere stemmen en projecten om de islam inderdaad de 21ste eeuw binnen te voeren
6683610 het alternatief bestaat erin om neutraliteit anders in te vullen namelijk als het toelaten van alle symbolen en tegelijk het controleren van de ambtenaar in de uitoefening van zijn functie mijn voorstel is om uit de religieuze maar soms ook vrijzinnige zelfgenoegzaamheid te treden en te zoeken naar procedures om met verschillen te leren leven eerder dan verschillen te willen wegwerken

6683622 auch wenn pers nliche datensparsamkeit den spa faktor im netz unter umst nden etwas ausbremsen kann manchmal ist es besser nicht alle trends mitzumachen

6683640 the indian recruits are people who have gone through their training through some management experience and are competent to manage the job technically and supervise juniors
6683641 many of our colleagues opt for the private sector which is much more lucrative and even those who try to help the country out of patriotism are often lured away by salaries that can be double that offered in government positions hopefully the indian contingent will help train enough locals at junior level to develop capacity

6683783 i dont think we can necessarily save these jobs today but what we have got to do is get the setting in place for the long term
6683784 so many of these things have been put in the too hard basket for too long the government is going to front up and accept its responsibility and do something for the long term
6683785 we understand the importance of the industry what a big employer it ford is a big exporter it is and were addressing those issues as well
6683786 there is an air of insecurity out there and thats why it is important that instead of getting constant announcements about job losses were wanting to get some announcements about investment
6683787 we know that the industry is facing these acute challenges and i cant say with any certainty that there wont be further announcements in regard to job losses
6683788 what were seeing here is the legacy of neglect from the previous government
6683789 this industry has been left on automatic pilot pretty much since 2002

6683864 its entrusted with a great deal of highly confidential material and it seems to be entirely incapable of keeping it secure
6683865 and the consequences are very serious theyre serious because it may lead to the identity of the people involved being revealed
6683866 one of the possible consequences is that they criminals will bring legal actions against the government and the taxpayer will then have to pay damages to people who appear to be pretty undeserving because of the governments incompetence
6683867 it is deeply worrying that after a number of major data losses and the publication of two government reports on high profile breaches of the data protection act more personal information has been reported lost
6683868 we will then decide what further action may be appropriate searching questions must be answered about what safeguards were in place to protect this information
6683869 if you hand out memory sticks almost like confetti to companies and ask them to do research for you then you have to be absolutely certain that the company concerned has put in practice procedures which will be just as robust as the procedures that i hope the government has followed

6684002 an individual who is receiving institutional financial aid that is countable against the aid limitations in a sport
6684003 i would love to have him back but im at 85 and it would put me over the top hes a holder and i cant ask a kid to forgo a scholarship things could change somebody could leave the team but ive got other kids who are walk ons who are maybe more deserving because hes a holder
6684004 it seems like you have to fight every semester for that spot
6684005 whereas somebody on scholarship just has to maintain you start out every camp on the bottom of the depth chart
6684006 having gone through being a walk on myself he was one of those guys you always root for
6684007 hes not the biggest guy or the fastest guy but hes got a lot of heart every program has someone like him
6684008 its hard to end your career like that it kind of leaves a bad taste because i didnt really accomplish completely what i set for myself
6684009 i did get one pass my way in san francisco at past seasons emerald bowl but it was at my feet chris turner was rolling out and it was an off balance pass
6684010 you develop such a good relationship such a good chemistry
6684011 it was our first spring practice it was about 25 degrees and it was snowing
6684012 the footballs were frozen and my hands were frozen i kind of double clutched it
6684013 its patience and background and just being soaked in the technology
6684014 were already out in customers homes theyre buying plasma tvs and connecting pcs with peripherals and printers
6684015 were now able with connectech to install service connect their devices optimize the service and really bring out the full value of what theyve purchased
6684016 there are a lot of people who have entered the service arena but have not gone far because its much harder to make this work
6684017 everyone can say they want to offer service but the first question you have to answer is are you going to own it or outsource it
6684018 obviously telecom providers are trying to take their services up the value curve but theyre also taking their customers up the learning curve
6684019 as you move up the learning curve unless you have sophisticated end users many will need help
6684020 we recognize the fact the trajectory of our traffic in our business is unacceptable
6684021 we are doing work behind the scenes and we are getting ourselves ready to play more offensively minded when it comes to getting traffic through the front doors
6684022 in the last six months tom unified the organization and brought renewed focus to our customer target while making the tough changes necessary to get the brand back on track
6684023 a young mom on a budget purchasing for herself and her family
6684024 at the beginning of the year they tried to focus more on fashion
6684025 but its hard to reposition yourself that way when youre known for value the challenge for tom will be to find the right balance between fashion and value for old navys broad target market you have to have enough cutting edge fashion to make the store look relevant and hip but enough of the basics for your core customer
6684026 hes well respected internally and hes been at gap for several years
6684027 as they continue to work on turning around the brand its important to have leadership that really understands what gap and its brands are about
6684028 all the 40 restaurants that participated were green which is special since green restaurants are still in a minority
6684029 but these two stood out head and shoulders above the rest for doing so many things that were completely voluntary and self motivated
6684030 its our goal to be as relevant as possible to as many people as we can
6684031 the fact that you have someone like hallmark going into that niche shows its growing and signals a trend
6684032 a lot of people think a gay greeting card needs a rainbow on it
6684033 this is for people to come together be out on the street to light up the night and show there is a lot of care and support in rockridge and oakland for everyone here
6684034 we are very aware that these crimes can impact not only the individual business but also the entire retail district
6684035 merchants are also very concerned that the public know that oaklands merchants are open for business and that we encourage shoppers diners and investors to continue to visit our stores and businesses
6684036 we live here we wont stop coming out in the evenings
6684037 it makes us more aware of whats happening around us
6684038 gives you pause no doubt about that you always think it wont happen to you
6684039 i think that everyone in oakland will be thinking twice about going out to eat
6684040 first of all the cost of eating out is expensive enough as it is im not going to run the risk of being robbed on top of that however slight the chance may be
6684041 we want to take the opportunity to walk the street together and strengthen the relationships already there
6684042 we want to show support for pasta pomodoro and all merchants
6684043 if people call us before the fact and request a business security survey it helps them to be less vulnerable
6684044 they like the fact that the police department is coming in and having a one on one with them talking to them about their needs their business
6684045 restaurants are hurting anyway from the downturn in the economy
6684046 ive been talking about it with my girlfriend we wonder if it could be attributed to the downturn in the economy in desperate times people come to areas where they know the money is
6684047 all three reports tend to indicate that were bottoming out but that there is no real end in sight and thats what i think the market has to get used to
6684048 m s que el gol disfruto tambi n la victoria del equipo la felicidad que le hemos dado a nuestro pa s es bueno iniciar bien la eliminatoria con los tres primeros puntos ahora a pensar en jamaica
6684049 si hacemos un an lisis del partido creo que tuvimos cuatro o cinco oportunidades claras de gol incluyendo los tantos mientras que honduras tuvo s lo el gol y despu s un tiro al arco en el segundo tiempo despu s no tuvieron m s oportunidades
6684050 la impresi n de que es un t cnico con experiencia y ganador ha estado en grandes equipos y selecciones sabe de la alta competencia del reto internacional y obvio que tuvimos poco tiempo con l pero iremos mejorando trabajaremos m s en los aspectos t cticos y estos pocos d as que tuvimos fueron enfocados a lo t ctico
6684051 eso depende de c mo lo hagamos nosotros vamos a tener que enfrentar a equipos complicados de hecho ning n juego ya es f cil y eso lo podemos ver en todas partes del mundo lo hemos visto tambi n en la eurocopa y los mundiales debemos trabajar y jugar bien
6684052 pienso que hay muchos detalles que ver como el viaje la altura son j venes que est n en grandes equipos y son promesas van a crecer y mejorar ambos tienen calidad y por algo est n donde est n despu s vienen m s exigencias y por ah los de experiencia deben cargar con m s peso pero creo que tienen la capacidad para responder adem s todos podemos tener un mal juego pero han demostrado que son grandes jugadores les tengo fe porque son desequilibrantes y nos ayudar n much simo
6684053 es la primera vez que hago dos goles con la selecci n en un partido en el primero desde que ven a la pelota y le pegu sab a que iba con direcci n eso se sabe desde que le pegas y la sent como gol
6684054 it went very very smoothly and professionally the whale suffered as little as possible
6684055 the fact that the sector is not fully driven by economic conditions is certainly in its favour right now
6684056 these companies are so event driven and its very hard to know exactly when these events are going to occur
6684057 thats driven a lot of the performance of our portfolio
6684058 thats always a good prescription sorry for the pun there
6684059 im captain of this team and i want so badly to win gold
6684060 if theres anything i know about lauren its that if she could suck it up and play and finish the wnba season she would
6684061 that tells you something about the severity of the injury she cant walk and play without getting a shot
6684062 ive been getting injected before every game and i just didnt think i could go through the rest of the season playing that way
6684063 obviously this season my focus has been the olympics and im going to give it my all
6684064 but ive made the choice to have the surgery this is something i have to do its in my best interest to have it now so that it doesnt get any worse i have a long career ahead and i dont want to jeopardize any of it
6684065 to be honest i dont feel a thing when im out there on the court
6684066 that was a little scary initially but im past that now
6684067 i dont think ive ever coached somebody whos that determined who can compartmentalize that area of the game
6684068 she just puts the pain aside and really gets after it she must really be hurting to put aside the wnba season to have that surgery
6684069 but i think she thrives on the pain i think the pain just makes her tougher and its hard for her to get tougher than she already is
6684070 lauren is one of the best players to ever touch a basketball if you ask anyone whos ever played against her shes the ultimate competitor i know shes injured but thats not going to stop her from doing what she has to do here
6684071 that to me is the most striking part about it transmitting 60 watts at 75 percent efficiency over several feet
6684072 nothing else good that was going on could receive any attention because of that issue
6684073 some investors have not been happy with the way that diller has managed the company and so they might be more open to looking at the pieces hes no longer associated with
6684074 so far most business lobby groups have stuck to their usual position of opposing anything that benefits staff including a new bank holiday
6684075 but we urge these organisations to think outside the box and recognise the benefits a new bank holiday could bring to many of their members
6684076 we urge businesses politicians and community groups to join us in our campaign for a new community day bank holiday

6684172 i guess if you think that being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong
6684173 but if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective

6684187 the acccs market inquiries indicated that the proposed acquisition may raise competition concerns in relation to the global seaborne supply of iron ore lump and iron ore fines
6684188 to the extent the proposed acquisition lessens competition in the global seaborne supply of iron ore it would be likely to have the effect of increasing global iron ore prices which would in turn increase prices paid by steel makers in australia
6684189 interested parties also expressed concern that there would appear to be few alternative suppliers capable of supplying significant quantities of iron ore lump and iron ore fines at a cost that would be likely to impose an effective competitive constraint on the merged firm across the anticipated business cycle

6684225 the new guy will have to do what he can but he cant be gene upshaw
6684226 he played a colossal role in the success the nfl enjoys today even more than many people realize
6684227 now is the time to talk about the loss and his legacy
6684228 considering where we were when i started in 1990 its been an astronomical change teams probably had a payroll of 50 million then now its 110million the state of the league is very healthy his legacy is tremendous
6684229 he would come to the house and wed go to church together
6684230 the reality of life for all the guys who played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span its just the way it is
6684231 i have sympathy for his family i have sympathy for his wife and children
6684232 i think no matter what happens you have to view everything as an opportunity
6684233 people are healthy people get injured and you cant really look at that youve just got to come out here every day and concentrate on yourself and make sure that you improve each and every day
6684234 sometimes guys who have been on the street for a year come back pretty hungry
6684235 obviously thats true with him we werent sure what we were getting but hes been very durable hes taken a lot of snaps through training camp and preseason games hes stood up and kept going and hes going strong
6684236 its better than going out there saturday and getting the crowd noise and being shocked with it
6684237 i would like to get a lot more reps before we start the regular season but ive got to be smart
6684238 being ready for the season is the most important thing right now
6684239 our stance with todd is that if hes 100 percent were going to have him out on the field
6684240 so theres a good chance hell play if we dont have a setback between now and then
6684241 were studying that right now and we want to make sure we have it right because when they dont get the call then were not on the same page
6684242 theres no upside to being adversarial in these kind of deals youve just got to stay positive and youve got to focus on whos here and have trust and faith in the people that are working on getting everything done
6684243 no one gets 100 percent of what they would like to happen but me and my agent are happy
6684244 of course there were heated debates on the phone but no one attacked publicly i still feel the same way about this organization as i did last year the last game of the season
6684245 its more the conditioning factor of starting and stopping and getting in the huddle and doing all that we have plans to do some extra things with him even when were not practicing
6684246 taking a lot of hits you never know if you can jeopardize it
6684247 the only safe bet to not signing a new deal right away is staying out of harms way
6684248 bastante tiempo en tener un atleta como jefferson p rez

6684250 me siento dolorido contento y con la frente alta porque di todo lo que pude dar

6684283 as a result too many businesses are failing to attract the right people or develop the talent they have

6684309 the judge seemed to ignore the plain evidence we provided and just accept reeds arguments even if he hadnt provided any documentation to back up his assertions
6684310 the fact of the matter is that these registrations are continuing to come in and reeds staff has shown an inability to intercept them in a timely fashion to prevent illegal voting
6684311 we need to continue to do what were doing now and remain vigilant

6684348 despite being dismissed by a number of scientists as of little consequence to the present discussion of climate change the issue of the suns activity or apparent lack of it has been the subject of considerable debate in recent months scientists who concern themselves with the fledgling subject of space weather changes in the suns emissions have been wondering where all the sunspots have gone when they might come back and what effect this will have on climate the next solar cycle is taking a long time to start and this lack of activity has prompted observers to invoke the possibility of another maunder minimum a period from 1645 to 1715 with very few sunspots which is associated with a sequence of bitter winters known as the little ice age
6684349 he also says he can point to a physical mechanism in the circulation of the ocean linking the suns influence on temperature in the region
6684350 baker tells the afr he has identified a strong correlation between sunspots the suns magnetic activity and the southern oscillation index soi he says variations in the earths magnetic field account for about half of the variation in the soi and that changes in sunspot activity as an indicator of magnetic activity can be correlated with rainfall patterns in south east australia
6684351 we will have to help them rebuild because they are a partner in the war on terror
6684352 there are indications but not enough to make us believe that its going as fast as it should
6684353 russia should honor its commitment to withdraw the sooner the better its overdue already
6684354 we need to take a look at the strategic picture now and we need nato the european union to discuss the fact that many assumptions we have made may have changed and we need to take a hard look at this new reality
6684355 the objective of our visit is to consult widely on the crisis that is not yet resolved in zimbabwe and we are consulting here in africa especially in kenya because we want to borrow lessons from experience of what happened in kenya and what is likely to happen in zimbabwe and we are are here to compare notes

6684358 i am very pleased these leases have been supported so we can tackle the unacceptable overcrowding highlighted by commissioner ted mullighan
6684359 this is a major development for tackling disadvantage on the apy lands
6684360 the commonwealth can now move forward on our 25 million commitment and start building and upgrading housing in apy communities
6684361 these leases will ensure that the new and improved houses are properly maintained and repaired by the south australian public housing authority and that relevant social support services are available to tenants
6684362 there will also be new work and training opportunities for indigenous australians in the construction and maintenance of the new and upgraded houses

6684368 by the way the answer is john mccain has seven homes
6684369 i guess if you think being rich is you have to make 5 million a year and you have to think about how many houses you have then you might think the economy is fundamentally strong

6684381 understanding how they run by seeing how they ran a in need of victory reds host revs
6684382 man do the blue jays ever need another mediocre utility infielder
6684383 hence we are testing on women then dogs and then chimps in that order
6684384 if the subjects family wish us to install some glass perhaps because they fear she will catch a cold from the breezes of deep space then they are welcome to pay for it
6684385 our first designs leaned fairly heavily towards flying carpets ottomans pulled by a team of wild geese and white stage pursued by hounds that would leap off a cliff and into space
6684386 the carpets tended to burn or if made in china melt same thing with the geese except obviously they didnt really ever melt just sort of exploded as soon as we introduced the rocket fuel to the system
6684387 we also learned that white stags can only jump about ten or twenty feet in the air and that they then develop considerable downward momentum
6684388 weve opted for a minimalist interior just a settee a bowl of scented water some maps of the cosmos and a large lever forward to go back to stop
6684389 we constantly had to keep in mind that we needed to make it simple enough for a woman to use

6684395 the chief of ukraines general staff serhiy kirichenko promised to fulfill yushchenkos decree
6684396 cautions that ukraine could be russias next target as part of what he says is a grand kremlin plan for the partial restoration of russian greatness
6684397 russia right now wants at least half of ukraine to be annexed vladimir putin talked about that rather openly at the nato summit in bucharest romania in april ukraine will disintegrate into two halves and we want the eastern half including of course first and foremost crimea
6684398 felgenhauer says ukraines overwhelming vote for independence in 1991 which included a majority of crimeans means nothing to kremlin rulers who the analyst says do not respect the will of even their own people

6684400 georgian special units are conducting preparation for mounting terrorist attacks on the territory of south ossetia and neighboring districts
6684401 they can just stage that kind of assault or attack on some of their units in order to stay here longer

6684403 all we could see was ice it was like 5 by 5 foot chunks of ice i didnt see how anyone could survive that
6684404 it sounds like the boys are going to be just fine
6684405 i went from the lowest ive ever been to now its just great
6684406 we were just hiking up when joni the mom was on the phone with 911
6684407 we went into the portion of the ice cave that was still intact and started calling out the boys names for a really long time
6684408 thats a great sign theres somebody there and theyre talking back
6684409 a couple of years ago i was able to buy everything practically new
6684410 you just have to do some things different to adjust
6684411 weve seen an increase in terms of clothes school supplies broken in sports gear its a great way to get brand name styles for cheaper
6684412 its not just the working poor were also seeing more middle class families coming to us
6684413 parents would go naked before they would send their kids to school without the right tools to be able to get an education
6684414 you dont want a child to feel embarrassed or left out
6684415 thats not a good way to start the school year
6684416 gas alone is making me rethink a whole lot of things it looks like well have to do fewer projects or just come up with another creative way to do them
6684417 she said she cant have a regular calculator it has to have different functions on it
6684418 you make sure that the teacher understands whats going on so they dont penalize them
6684419 i should probably know who these women are but i dont read authors by nationality
6684420 whether an inmates crime was especially callous or shockingly vicious or lethal
6684421 the ultimate conclusion that an inmate continues to pose an unreasonable risk to public safety
6684422 to normally grant parole to life prisoners who have committed murder
6684423 alone rarely will provide a valid basis for denying parole when there is strong evidence of rehabilitation and no other evidence of current dangerousness
6684424 im ready to start living my life i couldnt do that before because it was so up in the air
6684425 the awesome responsibility of deciding whether to release a convicted murderer on parole an act that inherently runs the risk that the inmate will again kill an innocent person lies with the executive branch not the judicial branch
6684426 she did this as a birthday present to herself because she was disappointed that her lover would not leave the victim for her
6684427 i typed the word google into google guess what came up everything
6684428 ive never seen a homeless guy with a bottle of gatorade

6684431 a couple of assassins theyre going to be tough chicks
6684432 they are only having sex when i die if they dont date boys at all and just want to be infatuated with their father that is what i am really going for
6684433 i wish i had been nude from the time i was 12 until i was 28 i looked great
6684434 i want to tell all young girls to walk around in bikinis all summer and enjoy it i want to tell them to never ever feel bad about anything because there will be that one day in your 20s when youll eat a hamburger and actually see the hamburger on the side of your leg
6684435 im all right im just fine and youre a tool
6684436 its very sarcastic and sick humor and its also a screw you anthem with so much love attached its like when a kindergartener goes up and punches a girl he likes and runs away
6684437 its seven seven houses and heres one house americans cant afford john mccain to move into
6684438 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6684439 i guess if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong
6684440 but if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6684441 a statewide search to find pennsylvanians who like john mccain have so many homes that they just cant keep track of the number
6684442 its an easy inexpensive way to get multi room audio without professional installation
6684443 as much fun as this is id much rather be behind the camera
6684444 everything i learned about documentary film i learned in the wrigley building
6684445 we can look back and kick ourselves for the things we didnt do
6684446 but youve got to give them credit for the things they did do
6684447 shes been on that team for a long time you know shes a great player we have great players too its just she really shined through tonight
6684448 do you want to win yes do you need goalkeepers to win yes
6684449 when all the people retired we kind of went through an identity crisis of who we were
6684450 we lost the last world cup we lost 4 0 to brazil and it made us just take analysis of what was working and what wasnt
6684451 its no longer the julie foudy and mia hamm show
6684452 getting vaccinated is the safest thing we can do for children
6684453 at the national level i am concerned about our situation
6684454 every year the u s experiences importation of measles what is different this year is once it is imported we are seeing it spread to more people and most of that spread is to people under 20
6684455 this highlights that even with extremely high vaccine levels we could have sizable pockets of people contract measles
6684456 similar to whats happening in israel it could result in much higher outbreaks than we have now
6684457 one of the reasons that some parents have withheld measles vaccines is they believe that the risk is very low
6684458 i think that publicity about concerns about the safety of vaccines has contributed to parents delaying or deferring the vaccine for their children
6684459 unfortunately parents are not considering the risks of the disease

6684463 i do think we are going to see attacks i think we have been seeing attacks already going on in the field
6684464 were doing everything we can to mitigate and reduce its incidence
6684465 there are other scenarios that i cant unfortunately get into
6684466 the consequence of non cooperation in the fight against phishing
6684467 the economics of information security a survey and open questions
6684468 secure path key revocation for symmetric key pre distribution schemes in sensor networks
6684469 so near and yet so far distance bounding attacks in wireless networks
6684470 suicide for the common good a new strategy for credential revocation in self organizing systems
6684471 a collusion attack on pairwise key predistribution schemes for distributed sensor networks
6684472 ss7 messaging attacks on public telephone networks attack scenarios and detection
6684473 they cant believe their eyes things like this dont usually happen
6684474 a nutter will step out of the crowd with a big knife for him
6684475 jacqui smiths botched handling of the announcement triggered a farcical and embarrassing merry go round she should not have announced it until he got back
6684476 the agency has determined that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment
6684477 it is unbelievable that the fdas first action on this issue is to turn to irradiation rather than focus on how to prevent contamination of these crops
6684478 instead of beefing up its capacity to inspect food facilities or test food for contamination all the fda has to offer consumers is an impractical ineffective and very expensive gimmick like irradiation
6684479 i think that from a growers perspective we have to consider anything that helps us provide safety for consumers but whether this takes off depends on consumers
6684480 in any marketing decision we have to look at cost in adapting the technology and consumer acceptance
6684481 its not something we have talked about in the year and a half we have had the marketing agreement in place
6684482 i do not know anyone clamoring for it there has to be consumer acceptance we do not know how big a hurdle that might be the science needs to be looked at and the cost too
6684483 its more of a safety net no matter how good a job you do with preventative steps good practices proper sanitation there is still a small chance for contamination this takes care of those small chances
6684484 and those products are ripe for using some kill step like irradiation to make it safer
6684485 la fuerte ejecuci n de nuestro negocio nos ha llevado a experimentar en impresi n un alto crecimiento de las ventas tanto a nivel internacional como en am rica del norte as como un fuerte incremento de soluciones empresariales
6684486 women are often lured into cpcs only to find that the staff members usually have no professional training and the environment is filled with inaccurate anti choice information
6684487 its common for cpcs to use misleading films ultrasound pictures and written materials to scare and emotionally manipulate women into continuing their pregnancies by presenting women with false information about abortion and the development of the fetus cpcs threaten womens abilities to make informed choices
6684488 doctors who have a moral objection to abortion should make this clear to any patient who asks them for help they should also arrange for them to see someone else who would be prepared to help
6684489 political language is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind
6684490 to acknowledge that is a very particular issue because we have to tackle doping and medication issues which also perhaps skews perceptions at times
6684491 whats also very important to being an olympics sport is an effective system and in terms of deterrence of doping and i think thats exactly what were doing
6684492 its just a shame that its happened its a big thing here and its going to be publicized in the wrong way its sad for the sport

6684497 this is the iraqi governments view and what the government wants
6684498 well have agreement when we have agreement so all of those stories in the newspapers about what the agreement says probably ought to be disregarded until we have an agreement
6684499 there are dates which will depend on the situation on the ground and the decisions of the iraqi government according to security developments and according to the need of the iraqis
6684500 the president and every american wants to see american troops come home but not until the job is done and there is more security more political progress and more economic progress inside iraq

6684506 for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places
6684507 there is evidence that there is a list that contains over 6 million names the red listed people are those who will be woken at 4am and taken to the camps and probably killed red list these people are the enemies of the nwo they are the leaders of patriot groups outspoken ministers outspoken talk show hosts community leaders and probably even net leaders these people will be dragged out of their homes at 4 00 am and will be taken to fema detention centers and killed this will take place approx 2 weeks before martial law is enforced blue list these are also enemies of the nwo but are followers of the red list folks these people will be rounded up after martial law is in place and will be taken to the detention centers and re educated various mind control techniques will used on them most will not survive this mr springmeier was not specific on exactly who was on the blue list but i would guess that people such as you and i are on that list yellow list these are citizens who know nothing about the nwo and dont want to know they are considered to be no threat at all and will be instructed as to how to behave and will most likely do whatever they are told unfortunately there are too many of these to be effectively controlled so many will be killed or starved
6684508 these two supposed camps in mississippi do not exist members of the mississippi militia have checked these out on more than one occasion beginning back when they first appeared on the internet and throughout the patriot movement

6684513 the conduct of the security service facilitated interviews by or on behalf of the united states when mohamed was being detained by the united states incommunicado and without access to a lawyer
6684514 do not participate in solicit encourage or condone the use of torture or inhumane or degrading treatment
6684515 to the extent of making it clear to mohamed that the united kingdom government would not help him unless he cooperated fully with the united states authorities
6684516 the relationship of the united kingdom government to the united states authorities in connection with mohamed was far beyond that of a bystander or witness to the alleged wrongdoing
6684517 as he will not be able to try to establish the only answer he has to the confessions namely that they were involuntary and abstracted from him by wrongful treatment
6684518 however unfortunately when faced with the choice between the rule of law and upsetting its allies the americans it waivers in this commitment

6684525 only innocent people die when the pakistan army carries out airstrikes in bajaur or swat
6684526 i just believe qantas as big as it is and its just about the 10th biggest airline in the world which is quite amazing when you consider australias the 54th biggest country but we still are not big enough in five to 10 years to do it on our own
6684527 qantas will always be australian it will always have the great majority of its jobs in australia and its business in australia but there has to be a level of maturity when it comes to a discussion on this
6684528 the airline industry is very fragmented its hugely capital intensive other airlines are starting to merge and we must be part of that
6684529 i think these things just gravitate towards people i mean your companies you tend to sit down and you see a community of interest
6684530 im not saying theres anybody out there at the moment all im saying is that many airlines are now merging in situations where they probably would not have considered it three or four even five years ago
6684531 i feel badly for the athletes who wont get to use my shots but after tibet i know im right
6684532 threw him to the ground and attacked him with electric batons
6684533 its not what i wanted but i suppose ill have to take it
6684534 it was a tough competition and really close but my best wasnt enough so ill make do with a silver
6684535 it hurts and im upset i came to achieve a lot more and im gutted i cant believe that im standing here with an olympic medal and im so upset
6684536 craig should not blame himself its a team event and we all take full responsibility
6684537 it was slightly frustrating in the last round because i felt i could have thrown at least a medal distance but you cant say what if
6684538 theres a bit of everything going through my mind at the moment not to whinge or anything but they did start the clock on my last round way too early
6684539 i came here thinking i was always in with a medal shout tonight
6684540 i had a really good semi final i am just disappointed
6684541 i would not consider frosted flakes the food of an olympian
6684542 i would rather see him promoting oatmeal i would even rather see him promoting cheerios
6684543 im quite sure i will lose some of them hard cash plays a key role these guys are going to be offered more money than we are paying them and its up to british cycling to stand up and be counted
6684544 we want the women to wear skirts not shorts we want them to wear nicer shirts not ones made for men but shirts with more curves
6684545 i was serious about wanting to be elected but given my focus of the last few days the campaign was always a bit doomed
6684546 its been quite competitive and ive had ross edgar out on rollers handing out leaflets saying vote for chris
6684547 the message was serious though and im disappointed not to be elected i wanted british athletes to have a voice on the ioc and i wanted cyclists opinions to be heard as well
6684548 i know firsthand the frustrations we feel about how sport is sometimes run being involved would have at least made my voice heard
6684549 i think its starting to sink in the magnitude of it all im really humbled by the attention and interest from all corners of the globe
6684550 after athens there was some interest in me for about a fortnight when i got home but things went back to normal very soon this time around i dont know what to expect
6684551 i still think youll see me out and about doing my shopping i dont think the people close to me will let me get too big for my boots
6684552 forget people talking about a knighthood for me what about dave
6684553 he should be prime minister for the work hes done for this team personally id put him in charge of the nhs hed sort that problem out
6684554 this is the just the start of a great era for british cycling
6684555 when you look at the talent coming into the academy its incredible too many sports say they are going to do something and then dont deliver its just a great privilege to be part of a programme that talks the talk and also walks the walk
6684556 our coach shane sutton told me last night that if im at the olympics in four years time and winning then he is not doing his job properly
6684557 there are three girls coming through the ranks jenny wallwork gabby white and imogen bankier who are all worth considering
6684558 nathan says he is missing me already but he needs a new challenge and a fresh race its going to be a shock for him working with someone new after all these years with me
6684559 hes joked he might hold some x factor style auditions to find the right girl but its great that weve got some much talent coming through
6684560 but its not always the best player its the person who has the right chemistry with nathan that will get the chance
6684561 weve played together for seven years so it will be tough for whoever comes in
6684562 im going to be available to help the new partner probably as a therapist because nathan is an incredibly gifted player but also very demanding
6684563 i found him incredibly easy to play with from the start but it will be very scary for whoever steps in
6684564 i wont be a coach but ill be there to help with the chemistry of the pair
6684565 in 2012 ill probably feel like a jealous ex girlfriend but im going to be there for them all the way
6684566 rebecca romero is such an inspiration winning two medals in two different disciplines im looking what medal i could compete in and for 2012 see what sport i could pick up
6684567 our sport never gets any media coverage at any other tournament so it has been strange in the build up to the olympics
6684568 this will be so different there will be a huge crowd there there will be thousands watching at home on television it will be like nothing i have ever experienced before
6684569 i have no idea how i will feel it probably wont be until the morning of the first day before it hits me
6684570 once that letter of confirmation came through that i was going it was a massive relief and it was almost as if i could talk about it after that
6684571 it has sunk in but i havent been to an olympics before so i dont know what i am expectin
6684572 i know that i have got the ability i just have to go there perform to the best of my ability and see what happens
6684573 i am capable of medalling and i have proved it this year with a bronze medal at the world championships that i can
6684574 on one day you have to get those five disciplines right and its very hard but ive done it before and i can do it in beijing
6684575 i have proved in the past that i can go past people and it is something i am looking forward to
6684576 as long as i am there or thereabouts i would be confident i could make up any ground
6684577 in cairo at the world cup i was in second place and i knew if i could get into the lead i would be able to hold it
6684578 with the variety of the modern pentathlon things can go wrong and if they do your chances of winning can go out of the window
6684579 we have five events so i will just go to each one and take it on individually rather than look at the bigger picture
6684580 playing for england is not enjoyable experience i look at the england set up players want to play for england because it is the height of their profession
6684581 sometimes you go and you wonder if the pinnacle should be enjoyable and you wonder how enjoyable it is because there is so much flack
6684582 it is not enjoyable for fans players managers and we have to change that
6684583 fans are not in love with the players and players do not enjoy playing the boro boss however took heart from stuart downings lively cameo performance when he replaced wayne rooney for the final 20 minutes
6684584 he didnt give possession away and was positive stuart has done well for the new manager clearly there are many aspects of his england playing days that southgate recalls with fondness but his overriding view is that the burden of expectations has a negative impact on player performance
6684585 at times i enjoyed it but sometimes you played with fear you knew the fall out would be intense if performances went wrong he said
6684586 its hard to build a team when youre only together for a few days
6684587 theres a huge build up and massive down turn during the game in terms of loss of confidence
6684588 players getting booed on and booed off i loved playing at wembley but it can be a difficult crowd to play in front of he recalled
6684589 players have been singled out for a long time john barnes was crucified
6684590 we england have made one final in 80 years so lets look at everything we are doing he said
6684591 do we give youth its chance there are so many issues it is not as simple as saying players do well for club and not for country
6684592 and managers would all come up with same 25 names for a squad
6684593 dealing with the pressure is the biggest thing that is sport at the highest level they have got to deal with that
6684594 but maybe we could be more realistic about how quickly we can achieve
6684595 you wonder how important international football is in the calendar champions league games are of a higher quality now england versus andorra next month is a pointless fixture
6684596 i was so glad when i woke up and saw it pouring down because i knew that would suit me
6684597 i was expecting a slower race but the conditions made the pace very quick so i didnt get the top 20 place i was looking for
6684598 on reflection maybe hot weather might have been better because i would have probably picked a few more off
6684599 i had 8km left and i saw i had two cards i thought do i keep on pushing on because i really wanted to lower my british record
6684600 however i had to be a bit cautious because nothing would have been worse than getting disqualified at the olympics
6684601 ive got a lot more to go with my training
6684602 i only started race walking when i was 18 so ive still got some catching up to do
6684603 this is my first full year on lottery funding and hopefully the improvements ive made this season will mean i get more towards my training next year
6684604 i need to spend some more time on my technique work and come back stronger in for next years world championships where i really want to go under 90 minutes
6684605 im looking forward to it the ankle is feeling great today 100 percent better than yesterday
6684606 its getting better every day and ill be ready mentally
6684607 this is the match up we wanted its the two best teams in the world
6684608 that is their style and thats the way they play we dont back down from that in any way shape or form
6684609 well all be physical tomorrow thats to be expected as you are playing for a gold medal this is the biggest prize in the world and we expect them to throw everything at us
6684610 i didnt think eight years down the track i would be lucky enough to be playing beside lauren jackson its huge honour
6684611 i thought i had done enough when i hit her chest and made it pop
6684612 i thought i scored a few times which didnt register in the third round
6684613 it would have been nice if it went until somebody scored a point
6684614 we fought before in spain and i lost so i felt a bit of pressure going into todays match
6684615 i had a hard time luring my opponent into attacking so i could use my kicks i plan to work on this for the next match
6684616 eine kritische berpr fung von gesch ften der kfw f r die offensichtlich die expertise nicht ausreicht
6684617 but the traditional methods are going to do a slightly better job for those two things
6684618 traditionally these guys focus on getting stronger and building bulk
6684619 but then they slow down and cant hit the ball as hard
6684620 he was a strong leader who was highly respected by those around him he died doing what he loved being a soldier
6684621 the cost is high but the end result will hopefully be worth it
6684622 taken from us far too soon my friend i will always see you smiling
6684623 the minister has recently confirmed with vanoc in writing that the department of canadian heritage intends to invest 20 million toward the opening ceremony of the olympic winter games in order to ensure that the event adequately reflects the priorities of the government and helps to achieve its domestic and international branding goals
6684624 no one level of government told us which way to go
6684625 it was complete synergy there was nobody who was lobbying because what they wanted wasnt getting done
6684626 we and all canadians look forward to a memorable opening ceremony that will allow the world to see the best that canada has to offer
6684627 to ensure that the opening ceremony is truly representative of canadas cultural diversity and linguistic duality by highlighting the excellence and richness of the performances of leading canadian artists
6684628 whos the government the government is the cabinet the government is the ruling political party which is the conservative party its not the priorities of canadian people
6684629 we would be very interested to know to what level their involvement is going to be is this going to be that they have direct input into being able to override anything the creators do
6684630 theres a disturbing ambiguity in the language a lot of very very vague terms that i think have dangerous implications in terms of artistic censorship
6684631 our government wants to ensure that canadas goals are achieved through the opening ceremonies naturally we will want to be involved in the planning especially if we have invested taxpayers money
6684632 this involvement of the federal government is our very best partner helping us understand and interpret the brand we call canada to the world
6684633 what id say is they are much more aggressive this fighting season than they have been in the past
6684634 the difference is they are not holding any of the ground that they attack us on so in the case of an ied improvised explosive device strike they will inflict some casualties but they dont control the road that they inflicted the casualties on so really the net effect is zero
6684635 i was behind the convoy when they reached a place where the road was already destroyed by a land mine
6684636 another land mine exploded on the canadian convoy near to howz e madad in the zhari district the tank was completely destroyed i dont think one of soldiers will be alive in that tank
6684637 he was a devoted father who liked to share stories with his children colleagues and friends
6684638 an engineer reconnaissance team is a tight knit unit and these men were no exception they were a well trained highly motivated crew and believed in their mission as combat engineers they were proud resourceful and armed with technical knowledge they generously used in this mission to help the people of kandahar
6684639 the taliban are against things they are not for anything they are against human rights they are against education they are against health care they are against women they are just against human decency
6684640 if we leave the population of kandahar province in the hands of the taliban we just wont be performing our duty and our soldiers know that
6684641 everybody knew already how to get traffic so there was nothing new
6684642 its kind of nice to see faces of people that i only read online
6684643 every time theres an attack like the one on the french my phone starts ringing
6684644 what should worry us is that the taliban movements are no longer isolated to the south
6684645 everything is directed by pakistan everybody knows that this is a fact because the big commanders of the taliban are in quetta
6684646 that means the army will also be watching the home front and less inclined to climb into the mountains and fight the taliban to do us a favour
6684647 if i was a canadian general i couldnt do anything more than they are doing
6684648 canadians will fail because of their afghan partners their partners still dont get it their partners are weak and are not doing their job
6684649 who gave which gift to who who is flying to dubai on which airline who is sitting in which position this is all the debates
6684650 i dont know why they put down cement the cement will just flake off
6684651 het zegt veel over de manier waarop gaia de controles uitvoert
6684652 als cross media agentur haben wir den berblick ber die traditionellen und neuen medien und k nnen von der konzeption bis zur durchf hrung alles aus einer hand anbieten
6684653 wahrscheinlich testen wir dann gleich den unteren rand bei 6 260
6684654 sollte es klare signale zur rettung von freddie und fannie geben d rften sich die bankwerte global erholen
6684655 zwar sind die einschl ge durch die neuen wettbewerber schon in den vergangenen wochen und monaten immer n her an die deutsche b rse gekommen und auch eingepreist worden aber die aussicht auf 30 weniger einnahmen ist schon ein wort
6684656 wir freuen uns sehr dass schlag den raab nun auch in schweden auf sendung geht und dort sogar die neue tv saison er ffnet
6684657 estoy enamorado del rock and roll de manera vergonzosa y es absolutamente adictivo
6684658 si potrei anche crederci ma poi e che senso ha mi chiedo ora aver fatto lamore con me fino a ieri notte non amore non neanche sesso non niente non pu essere niente
6684659 both of them give me nightmares and keep me up at night
6684660 id rather prepare for any team that doesnt have either one of those two guys on it there are a lot of good players in this conference but i think these two are clearly two of the best the mac has to offer
6684661 he plays with the glove on and doesnt grab the laces very unusual but he throws it as hard and as accurately as i have seen
6684662 hes not a runner he only runs when he absolutely has to and when he does hes going to gain a few yards and really not be a threat but because of what offensive coordinator stan parish does in providing different presnap formations it really keeps you off balance and he obviously has two very good weapons in receiver dante love and tight end darius hill
6684663 i wont say nates not as athletic but hes going to try to hang in the pocket a little bit longer dans a pain in the neck once he takes off and runs because last year he was the best running quarterback in the conference
6684664 you still have to respect lefevours passing ability and at the same time his running just gives his team another back in the backfield that can run the football
6684665 nate needs to make people respect that aspect of his game so if hes scrambling a little bit and getting close to the line of scrimmage the defense is going to have to suck up to him the way it is now we can just sit back and cover his receivers because we know he really doesnt want to run
6684666 the team that has the hot quarterback many times has the hot team
6684667 when you look and see at the end of the year wheres that first team all mac quarterback thats also where the championship team is
6684668 there is no final agreement but we are very close everything has been addressed tomorrow is a very important day
6684669 we have made a solid start with strong improvement in customer service over the past four months but we are on a three to five year journey to profit recovery
6684670 i dont know whats missing for us we cant explain it
6684671 we just dont know what is going on this is not fair
6684672 we keep getting to all these finals but for some reason we cant win its tough
6684673 we dominated the whole match but the ball wouldnt go into the back of the net
6684674 its just something we cant pinpoint maybe one day when we win a gold medal we will know the explanation
6684675 if we had won it would transform womens soccer in brazil so we had this hope that they would get the gold i dont know what can happen now
6684676 its very important that the top players will be with us
6684677 everyone the clubs the unions the players everyone said that any updated version of the regulations has to be carved out within that the players will be released for the olympic games
6684678 they support the sevens in the olympic movement and we receive the support of all the top level players
6684679 were seeing good support from a lot of people around the world and i am surprised about that
6684680 probably its a good support now to rejoin the olympics movement to be recognized apart of the family which we are
6684681 you have a stadium that is empty for a week after the opening ceremony we can fill that
6684682 i dont know whats missing for us we cant explain it
6684683 we just dont know what is going on this is not fair
6684684 we keep getting to all these finals but for some reason we cant win its tough
6684685 we dominated the whole match but the ball wouldnt go into the back of the net
6684686 its just something we cant pinpoint maybe one day when we win a gold medal we will know the explanation
6684687 if we had won it would transform womens football in brazil so we had this hope that they would get the gold i dont know what can happen now
6684688 to acknowledge that is a very particular issue because we have to tackle doping and medication issues which also perhaps skews perceptions at times
6684689 whats also very important to being an olympics sport is an effective system and in terms of deterrence of doping and i think thats exactly what were doing
6684690 its just a shame that its happened its a big thing here and its going to be publicised in the wrong way its sad for the sport
6684691 each of these academies has begun from a very low base achieving a culture shift after so many years of decline is a marathon not a sprint and there is much in these figures that signals that real progress is being made
6684692 i was swimming in zig zags didnt know what was happening i was all over the place and my head was spinning
6684693 i always knew i was a novice it might sound simple but its really really hard to swim straight
6684694 the two girls make out hardcore rolling around in a bed it was a really hot scene
6684695 the action scenes must entertain and not induce violence in people or bore them
6684696 pacific finances directors believe the continuation of the moratorium remains in the best interests of investors and the proposed arrangement is advantageous to both the company and investors
6684697 id like to say on behalf of the people of india that we wish her well and our prayers are with her
6684698 it would be a really smart quality designed not center parcs something different and better than that making use of all the attributes on that part of the island
6684699 the other is a significant employer but he does not need to be on an airport and could be on an industrial estate and we have been talking to them about that
6684700 i cant go into every game thinking ive got to do what darren and felix did
6684701 im michael i can only do what michael can do im preparing myself for that to be good enough
6684702 coming out of the spring michael smith was definitely the number one guy
6684703 but we will definitely use all of the running backs and whatever their talents are
6684704 im excited about our running backs theres going to be some young speed guys who work hard
6684705 deanthony curtis and dennis johnson i thought have shown their abilities i think that weve got a chance to keep improving but weve got a long way to go theres no doubt about that
6684706 either you do adapt or you dont and we have no choice we have to you make that turnaround almost immediately
6684707 now we may not do that as good as he wants but that in time will come because he demands perfection
6684708 i was waiting on it to come out at 12 and i got it and took it home and i beat it right then
6684709 we were keen to develop green space around the centre and the allotment increases the capacity of the centre as well as offering eco therapy to our increasing number of users
6684710 the space is close enough to the centre for us to use the wood workshop to make raised flowerbeds from recycled wood and big enough to experiment with different flowers vegetables and herbs
6684711 i grow all sorts but i like squashes my mum and dad got me into it and i just like watching everything grow
6684712 aarons entry in the newcomers class consisted of an amazing selection of 16 different types of vegetables
6684713 what an achievement for this young chap a record that will take some beating and one he will probably hold for several years
6684714 it is anticipated he will be a useful member of the committee
6684715 you really have to consider this the toughest top to bottom conference in the country just because theres not an easy week
6684716 you cant be focusing on just one team as a must win because each week is going to be in that category
6684717 its fun to come out here every day with these guys and coaches im loving it
6684718 im so ready i cant explain it just because its so emotional
6684719 were ready we still got some preparation and stuff to put in and stuff to learn but were going to be ready we want it
6684720 if somebody has to take a little bit longer to do that they have to do that but obviously youll have to do it at a quicker pace because we dont have the luxury like we did in spring to take our time were in season right now so you have to get it down and understand it
6684721 theres really not going to be too much time to wait to learn it but the coaches are going to give you your opportunities to learn
6684722 we want them to be out of their comfort zone
6684723 and as soon as theyre comfortable we want to push them more theyre all progressing but were going to continue to push so that they never feel like theyve arrived mentally because they never will
6684724 the morale of the team is really up and everyones really excited for the season
6684725 e buona parte dei risparmi si sarebbe dovuta tradurre in un contenimento dei prezzi di copertina

6684729 we are pleased to see a five per cent improvement on last year with 55 per cent of pupils gaining five or more a star to c and the figure including english and maths was up on last year at 43 per cent
6684730 i intended to kill him but he managed to crawl away like a snake
6684731 you stated you intended to kill him but fortunately he was able to push you away and make his escape
6684732 we thought we were doing fine in our proposal but we discovered the coastal centre had put tubes of mercury in we were not told there was monitoring up there
6684733 the solent has traditionally been quite a barrier to the ups and downs of the property market with island prices being less volatile
6684734 even so the credit crunch has dramatically affected the lower end of the market here
6684735 the old attendance record system was a blunt instrument for judging councillors performance it just recorded whether they turned up to sign the book not how effective they were
6684736 likewise relying on councillors to say how many hours they worked on council business was less than perfect one was apparently working 22 hours a day
6684737 of greater concern is the fact some have not completed their reports
6684738 councillors have a contract with the electorate and if they dont write the report they know what to expect at election time
6684739 attending meetings is just a small part of a councillors role and therefore simply recording attendances did not give a true picture
6684740 now councillors compile an annual report of their activities against which their effectiveness can be judged by electors

6684747 to have someone of genes age and the way he carried himself to all of a sudden receive a phone call that gene has passed away was a huge shock to me from where the union started to where it is today is leaps and bounds a lot of that credit has to go to gene and what he stood for
6684748 with the backing of the players he was able to get us in a pretty good position in terms of health benefits with help from the presidents at the time be it troy and trace armstrong
6684749 its been no secret that this has been troys ambition for a while
6684750 gene made some strong statements about not planning to leave im sure a number of people will want the position but i think troy will be high on the list of qualified people
6684751 troy is the kind of guy who can make things happen
6684752 he was a very competent president and a very involved president he took the job extremely seriously and handled the position as well as anyone has my initial gut reaction is that troy has a pretty good chance of getting the job

6684759 without a doubt i think every guy in that room in there knows were better than how weve been playing
6684760 the first group will go about three quarters and then well see how it goes from there
6684761 were going to give tony an opportunity there and see how he does
6684762 if we like what we see then well give him a little bit more if we dont then well move on to something else
6684763 teams know hes a strike thrower and hell make the adjustment
6684764 thats just another reason why we play in bathing suits
6684765 were going to take this journey together too we have to make the team of the future
6684766 i feel like we still have unfinished business but were not moms yet we dont know how thats going to change us
6684767 taking a baby on the road might not be the best thing for the baby
6684768 i get off the plane wearing whatever clothes i have for one night in arizona
6684769 then im gone for a few weeks i havent seen matt since july 17 the all star break
6684770 id like to spend more than one night at a time with my husband id like to come home and ask whats for dinner instead of just making something for myself
6684771 we havent sat down and had a heart to heart about it
6684772 its up in the air i cant imagine playing beach volleyball without misty may i hope thats the way it works out that we have our families and then we get back together its special what we have
6684773 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game
6684774 his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6684775 gene always believed the best way to build the popularity of our sport was to craft a dynamic partnership between the players and the owners that served the best interest of the fans
6684776 few people in the history of the national football league have played the game as well as gene and then had another career in football with so much positive impact on the structure and competitiveness of the entire league as gene
6684777 in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but didnt always do so he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture
6684778 a lot of hits he took were because a lot of people couldnt believe this black former football player was accomplishing what he was accomplishing
6684779 and we all know what a deal the last deal was and thats why the owners got out of it i dont think he ever got the credit he shouldve gotten for that because of the lack of acrimony between him and tagliabue and the last two years
6684780 the further you get away from how they led up to the deal and you look back and you realize what the union came away with i think that becomes the legacy the one big piece that i think was still in the process was this idea of the broader issue of retired players how you take care of them with injuries and the like it is kind of a sad additional piece to think about that he too becomes someone who dies young football players die young it keeps happening
6684781 he has meant a tremendous amount to the players union and was pivotal in creating the stature and footing they have today
6684782 we have knocked heads recently over issues relating to the treatment of former nfl players and the execution of the current disability system i disagreed with gene with regard the fact that there are major flaws in the disability program and on the nflpas treatment of retired players the problem still exists and needs to be addressed but today is not the time to talk about those issues or the future it is a time to extend condolences to his family
6684783 i felt like id do a lot better than this
6684784 when you practice and youre out there by yourself and you just want to turn it on and go you just go
6684785 im really disappointed in how flat i was in the last 200 meters
6684786 a lot of people dont understand that in running you practice different things just like a basketball team practices different plays you practice different segments of a race i really practiced closing it didnt work out well
6684787 ive got nothing else going on so i might as well
6684788 the other girls were just more ready to go it might just be one bad race its a shame it had to come at the olympics
6684789 aside from the disappointment of not making it and being under pressure for two weeks it was an amazing experience
6684790 this is definitely a heartbreaking way to end my international career
6684791 for me the highs and lows of watching that game were gut wrenching
6684792 i was out of my seat in the locker room
6684793 i was into it im a fan and i care a lot about heather i was more emotional watching that game than i am playing in one of my own they werent expected to win that game and heather after her injury wasnt supposed to be on that team so for her to be on that roster and to play and have them win it i couldnt be any prouder
6684794 ive talked to heather a couple times since she sent me the text
6684795 i know theyre exhausted but i imagine theyll find some energy to celebrate
6684796 our players are going to russia to play the chinese are coming to the wnba theres no borders anymore becky made a great business decision and had a great olympic experience
6684797 i stand on if youre an american you have the right to do whatever you want
6684798 for the most part americans are always doing things that people dont like it really is a tough subject becky is a great person and a tremendous basketball player it was a tough decision for her
6684799 i represent the usa and this is the only uniform ill ever put on i had no idea i was going to make this team i was on the bubble i was one of the last three players named if i made it wonderful if i didnt id cheer for my country to win a gold medal
6684800 to me its no different from australian tom maher coaching china my teammates disagree theyre not the first people to do it it has been done for years its nothing that i would do
6684801 the generations have changed the cold war is a distant memory if its a memory at all for our players for this generation
6684802 his plan and his focus were to make it back this year
6684803 obviously he worked extremely hard to put himself in this position
6684804 i tried to pull back and get out of the way when i saw the ball it was about a foot away
6684805 afirm bamos en un art culo anterior que la derecha desempe a en las sociedades democr ticas y muy concretamente en la espa ola un papel rid culo cual es el de jugar una partida en la que el adversario elige campo y determina las reglas del juego esta afirmaci n no creo que admita controversia cada d a vemos a los pol ticos de derechas esforz ndose penosamente por evitar que su adscripci n resulte notoria invent ndose chorradas sem nticas del tipo centro reformista rehuyendo la confrontaci n o adoptando posturas tibias en asuntos medulares en los que su adversario ha sentado c tedra aceptando compungidamente la superioridad cultural de la izquierda etc tera de este modo la derecha s lo puede aspirar a las migajillas de ganar unas elecciones de vez en cuando un de vez en cuando que a medida que pase el tiempo exigir el concurso de circunstancias m s excepcionales caos administrativo corrupci n generalizada crisis econ micas feroces etc tera si la derecha no se conformase con estas migajillas propondr a una revisi n a fondo del orden en el que las ideas de la izquierda han encontrado arraigo pero esta revisi n radical que exigir a una refutaci n de las mentiras sobre las que se ha ido sedimentando la ro a progre a lo largo de las d cadas no parece al alcance de la derecha que hoy padecemos
6684806 en realidad a la derecha le ocurre lo mismo que al rey don rodrigo en aquel romance c lebre que la izquierda la come por do m s pecado hab a y el origen de ese pecado se remonta a pocas ya remotas cuando la derecha tras el cambio de orden establecido por la revoluci n por temor a ser tildada de reaccionaria se present como la opci n ideol gica capaz de conciliar la libertad y el orden frente a una izquierda que propend a al desorden en su apetito desaforado de libertad tal conciliaci n hubiese sido fruct fera si la derecha hubiese propuesto un orden propio pero se conform con conservar la libertad del liberalismo y el orden revolucionario dando por buenos e inatacables los principios que los alentaban aceptar tales principios fue su pecado original y de aquellos polvos vinieron estos lodos
6684807 cuando aceptas unos principios que no son los tuyos como premisas del funcionamiento pol tico es natural que las consecuencias de tales principios siempre act en en tu contra y as le ocurri a la derecha que a cambio de unas pocas transacciones en el orden econ mico respeto a la propiedad privada etc tera hubo de transigir con el orden social y cultural que propugnaba la izquierda y desenvolvi ndose en un orden social y cultural adverso no tuvo otro remedio que ir aceptando las sucesivas conquistas de dicho orden para evitar que se la calificase de enemiga del progreso as cada vez que la derecha consegu a acceder al poder se limitaba a conservar las conquistas que previamente la izquierda hab a logrado y poco a poco la derecha fue convirti ndose en una especie de lacayo o ancilla de la izquierda encargada de mantener intacto el orden establecido cada vez que la izquierda abandonaba el poder para que luego una vez recuperado la izquierda pudiera seguir obrando a placer fue entonces cuando la derecha abochornada de su papel lacayuno se invent esa paparrucha del centro centro que por supuesto es movible y cuya localizaci n es inevitablemente determinada por la acci n de la izquierda y puesto que la izquierda no renuncia jam s a sus conquistas tal centro se sit a cada vez m s lejos de los principios originarios de la derecha esos principios a los que la de derecha renunci para que no se la tildase de reaccionaria
6684808 renunciando a sus principios y aceptando el orden establecido por la izquierda a la derecha s lo le resta actuar como fregona de los estropicios y desaguisados que la izquierda provoca como le ocurre a los falsos devotos que s lo se acuerdan de santa b rbara cuando truena la ciudadan a esto es el pueblo reducido a comparsa del orden establecido por la izquierda s lo vota a la derecha cuando le ve las orejas al lobo y pasado el peligro vuelve a votar a quien encarna con mayor autenticidad los principios que se presentan como buenos e inatacables a fin de cuentas por qu habr a de votar a esa panda de fracasados que los encarnan en su versi n descafeinada
6684809 oh were on our honeymoon and flying first class to miami and wanted to see if we could get in
6684810 dico quel che non penso e penso quel che non dico
6684811 it is the way it is but at the moment there is nothing happening on the outgoing front and it can be frustrating
6684812 but i will work right up to the window closing
6684813 thats the way it is sometimes but there is still time before the window closes
6684814 it was a disappointing start the effort was there but there was no quality and that is not what i want but we still have 44 games to play and people shouldnt write us off

6684820 its a great opportunity to be back to a place that is near and dear to my heart
6684821 i wasnt very happy to leave under the circumstances i left through the years wherever ive been ive had people comment about the philly days and people saying i never should have left that team
6684822 bringing elton brand in was huge because they missed that big presence in the middle
6684823 playing against them you could see they didnt have that go to guy down low that could sink the defense in
6684824 i can still do a little something on the court
6684825 does it matter if weve lost 10 in a row to the marlins if we beat them in the last eight
6684826 no the only thing that matters is the last game you win the next win thats all that matters we dont care how weve played against people
6684827 i think the guys are up for the challenge they know august and september is what separates the boys from the men theyre looking forward to payback we lost our first series to the dodgers in l a i think weve got to take care of home field advantage hopefully this time it goes our way but as far as our record with things weve done before we cant control that its over and done with
6684828 any help we would get would likely come from within the system
6684829 hes a humble guy but i know its my job to get the guy the baton and i didnt do that
6684830 its kind of the way its been happening to me this olympics
6684831 if people want to assess the blame to me thats ok
6684832 i mean i can take whatever it is that people are going to dish out we had good chemistry the hand was back there she was there i dont know what happened
6684833 i dont know what to say i ran the best i could
6684834 i was just floating out there carli and i both came a long way
6684835 but this was kind of another once in a lifetime thing
6684836 i have to say after the first game i didnt know that the gold medal would be possible
6684837 he turned me into a machine its funny looking back five years ago i could never run long distances he started out with a 15 minute run i said this is long i got up to a hour and a half
6684838 i told her a number of times that shes by far the best goalkeeper in the world
6684839 and if she goes by you youre not going to catch her so for us we were trying to keep her outside more than anything
6684840 for sure she really got into that ball very well i think actually it had a certain move to the ball right
6684841 vindicated i dont even think about that whatever i said last year im just enjoying this moment right now i feel great i just won a gold medal
6684842 this game i had a different feeling usually the nerves are going theres anxiety right up until the whistle blows to start the game something felt different
6684843 churandy martina wins the americans on the track but got beat on paper
6684844 as we were studying the video for wallace it was brought to our attention that there may have been a violation in lane 6
6684845 we saw the violation and appealed that result we then went through the rules process we wanted to make sure that the results of the race were fair
6684846 will you call the white house and talk of this with mr bush
6684847 a small country like ours we did not come here as victims
6684848 i think its a pity for a big country like the united states to make such a small statement
6684849 how is it possible that officials didnt know there had been a technical mistake
6684850 the u s have the right to protest but why when officials disqualified spearmon did they not notice churandys violation
6684851 they cant see if he stepped on or over a white line i dont understand it if i stood on the line then why did the jury not disqualify me at the same time as spearmon it was at least 90 minutes before they told me i was disqualified
6684852 if there is a question mark and we have a concern which we do we ask the governing body of any sport to look into it
6684853 whenever we define a pre viable fetus as a person that is protected by the constitution what were really saying is that they are persons entitled to the kinds of protections provided to a child that determination would forbid abortions to take place

6684875 you can be either a vain movie star or someone who can shed some light on the aspects of the human condition
6684876 at first of course it was random chance and assignment we bonded naturally from spending so much time together sharing the danger of our mission we lived every day with the knowledge that we could meet a final end at any moment there was constant excitement and frequent fear
6684877 all very good reasons why curt and i might have formed an attachment and decided to stay together when secrecy was no longer necessary
6684878 in so many millennia the humans never did figure love out how much is physical how much in the mind how much accident and how much fate why did perfect matches crumble and impossible couples thrive i dont know the answers any better than they did love simply is where it is my host loved curts host and that love did not die when the ownership of the minds changed

6684886 ou vos fils se pr sentent ici ou cest vous qui allez au struthof
6684887 queremos construir ciudadanos de paz y queremos que esto sea desde la aulas igual que desde ellas se fomente la reconciliaci n nacional
6684888 lo que ahora iniciamos se ver sometido a duras pruebas de confianza y credibilidad pero no pod a ser distinto si la aspiraci n es construir la educaci n del siglo xxi mexicano mediante la cual empoderar a la escuela ser esencial para combatir el centralismo y abrir espacios para la innovaci n la creatividad y la correcta diversificaci n que responda a los intereses y vocaciones de cada entidad federativa

6684890 abusar de la experiencia placentera puede causar trastornos graves o adicciones
6684891 lo que apenas supimos es que se utiliza por disposici n de la sep
6684892 abusar de la experiencia placentera puede provocar trastornos graves o adicciones
6684893 el deseo puede aplazarse sin perjuicio del la vida ni la salud
6684894 el vulo es fecundado por el espermatozoide se inaugura una nueva vida
6684895 siempre ver con respeto cualquier iniciativa que promueva la educaci n en el terreno de una sexualidad integral
6684896 las aulas junto con las familias se convierten en las redes m s poderosas para prevenir y evitar
6684897 el proyecto hablamos de dios fue pensado y elaborado conjuntamente con la arquidi cesis primada de m xico para que se utilicen en las aulas como un recurso que favorezca el conocimiento y la vivencia de la religi n cat lica
6684898 este proyecto se busca acercar a los alumnos desde una perspectiva did ctica al mensaje cristiano darles recursos para que lo relacionen con sus experiencias diarias y con las tradiciones religiosas y culturales de su entorno se pretende tambi n proporcionar una visi n cristiana de los valores que repercuten en la dignidad de la persona en el respeto mutuo y en la convivencia social escolar y familiar
6684899 los mandamientos de la ley de dios y su funci n como expresi n del amor a dios y al pr jimo
6684900 vamos a fijarnos ahora en los mandamientos sexto y noveno ambos hacen referencia al sentido cristiano de la sexualidad
6684901 sexto mandamiento no cometer s actos impuros es decir respetar el propio cuerpo y el de lo dem s como corresponde a un hijo de dios
6684902 no consentir s pensamientos ni deseos impuros es decir pensar en los dem s con un coraz n limpio
6684903 el libro tu futuro en libertad por una sexualidad y salud reproductiva con responsabilidad constituye un importante complemento de informaci n para los j venes adicional a la que obtienen en su c rculo familiar medios de comunicaci n e instituciones de salud
6684904 lejos de cumplir con la tarea educativa la sep viola los derechos de los j venes
6684905 constituye un verdadero atraso anclado en la ignorancia y el oscurantismo derechista
6684906 creo que los gobiernos lejos de no encontrarse en esta ocasi n deben dialogar para sacar adelante un muy buen libro sobre el tema de sexualidad y un programa conjunto a escala nacional
6684907 reducen de manera importante los ndices de contagio de enfermedades de transmisi n sexual
6684908 nosotros no nos oponemos a que haya libros de texto sobre sexualidad al contrario son bienvenidos pero que no sean con una visi n sesgada de un tema tan importante como lo est n haciendo en este momento
6684909 est siendo abordado s lo desde la parte er tica del uso del cuerpo y no de la plenitud del ser humano
6684910 porque queremos que el tema de la sexualidad sea abordado de manera integral
6684911 no estamos en un pa s de censuras y nadie tiene la verdad absoluta en materia de educaci n
6684912 de alguna manera la legislaci n mexicana permite la aplicaci n de la prisi n vitalicia pues si bien las penalidades m ximas son de 50 a os de prisi n stas son acumulables por lo que hay gente que pr cticamente est purgando cadena perpetua
6684913 en el momento que nos convoquen nos hagan el llamado como secci n 10 vamos a participar ya hemos valorado esta postura
6684914 la ley de trabajadores al servicio del estado como tampoco en la de educaci n es m s ni siquiera en los estatutos del sindicato magisterial
6684915 desde cu ndo se castiga impartir conocimiento porque el tema est incluido en los programas de biolog a aqu s lo implicar a dar una explicaci n m s profunda
6684916 un acto que nos regresa a la edad media porque hay un tab para leer sobre ciertos temas aunque por otro lado no dicen nada sobre el contenido sexual que se difunde diariamente en la televisi n
6684917 los alumnos siempre tienen preguntas al respecto ante la falta de informaci n en su casa
6684918 est haciendo uso de un material no aprobado y eso va a su expediente
6684919 pretenda ser utilizado como libro de texto o material de apoyo primero debe pasar por la revisi n de un comit evaluador integrado por un panel de expertos quienes definir n si tiene pertinencia en sus contenidos en el uso pedag gico y si la informaci n cumple con criterios cient ficos
6684920 solicita que se considere como material complementario y que este libro sea enviado al comit de evaluaci n del rea que corresponde para esos fines
6684921 siempre ha estado preocupada por mantener actualizados los contenidos sobre educaci n sexual en sus libros de texto y ahora pareciera que es la primera vez que hablamos de estos temas cuando se vienen aplicando en todas las aulas del pa s desde el siglo pasado recuerden la pol mica desatada en los a os 1997 1998 cuando hab a grupos que objetaban el contenido que si era muy expl cito pero la secretar a siempre ha mantenido un enfoque cient fico liberal y progresista en estos temas
6684922 distribuir su libro en donde quiera en la acera en la entrada de las estaciones del metro o donde juzgue pertinente eso no podemos impedirlo pero dentro de las escuelas p blicas federales de educaci n b sica no podr circular y al no estar autorizado por la sep no ser objeto de estudio en la clase que corresponda porque s lo se puede trabajar con los materiales aprobados
6684923 lleva por lo menos un a o y se hace con anticipaci n para evitar premura y la secretar a de educaci n capitalina tiene pleno conocimiento de este procedimiento pues le hice saber al titular de ese organismo xel didriksson desde septiembre pasado cu l era la instancia y el mecanismo para someter a consideraci n de educaci n p blica cualquier texto que pretenda que llegue a las aulas
6684924 saben perfectamente con qu libros pueden trabajar y son aquellos que est n aprobados e incluidos en la lista oficial de la sep por lo que no puede ser utilizado ni como material de apoyo
6684925 nadie ajeno a la comunidad escolar tendr acceso a las planteles y a quienes pretendan hacerlo para distribuir un libro se les invitar a no hacerlo y retirarse
6684926 si hay preguntas sobre educaci n sexual los maestros est n capacitados para responder y no creo que ninguno se sienta sorprendido
6684927 pienso que debiera asumirse que es conveniente que hay que hacerlo a nivel nacional
6684928 no hacer debates que me parece que francamente est n muy fuera de tiempo a m me parece que no vale la pena ponerse a discutir sobre si es o no o si se va a poder o no dar a los j venes este libro se los vamos a dar no les tenemos que pedir permiso lo estoy diciendo literalmente no es un desaf o
6684929 espero que haya mucho di logo en torno a esto porque estoy profundamente convencida de que la educaci n sexual y reproductiva y el hablar sobre las relaciones responsables es extremadamente importante
6684930 los j venes est n en mayor riesgo y deben conocer su cuerpo y saber c mo protegerlo y tienen que saber c mo pueden hacerlo por lo cual apremio al gobierno de m xico y a todos los gobiernos reticentes que creen que esto va a a sovacar la moralidad quiero decirles que por el contrario esto puede hacerse de manera tal que se promuevan las relaciones responsables
6684931 el libro ha tenido una respuesta positiva ya que se trata de un instrumento educativo pertinente de una educaci n adecuada para todos nuestros j venes
6684932 ya lo sabemos por eso estamos haciendo el libro porque eso es lo que hace falta en la curr cula no hay materias sobre educaci n sexual para los j venes ni hay libros de texto que aborden el tema
6684933 yo no le estoy pidiendo a la sep que haga una materia a partir de mi libro ni que el libro sea de texto oficial simplemente lo que le solicit fue que nos permitieran su distribuci n
6684934 nosotros no queremos que el libro tu futuro en libertad se convierta en texto oficial es un libro escolar complementario fundamentalmente para el desarrollo humano de los j venes del distrito federal
6684935 creemos que vamos muy bien y que no va a pasar de algunos pronunciamientos rid culos de la derecha preocupantes de la sep y algunos exagerados de parte de la ultraderecha que siempre se manifiesta por la abstinencia pero pregunten en este foro sobre la abstinencia a ver que les dicen
6684936 los vamos a derrotar porque no podr n venir ahora a cuestionar la calidad de quienes elaboraron este extraordinario libro
6684937 por ley cualquier libro de texto debe previamente ser valorado por la unidad responsable de materiales educativos
6684938 han mostrado su intenci n de distribuirlo en su paquete de vales para tiles y uniformes escolares pero el libro no tiene reconocimiento oficial
6684939 la sep ha mantenido siempre una posici n de apertura y tiene un enfoque muy moderno sobre este tema no sabemos si el libro es bueno o no ya que no conocemos su contenido pues apenas nos lo hicieron llegar pero tiene que pasar por el proceso de valoraci n de un grupo multidisciplinario de la sep
6684940 cu ndo debes iniciar las relaciones sexuales la decisi n sobre cu ndo se deben iniciar las relaciones sexuales es muy personal y respetable hay personas que desde el principio disfrutan ampliamente de las relaciones sexuales hay tambi n quienes necesitan m s conocimiento de la otra persona para empezar y deciden esperar hasta que se estreche la relaci n se puede tomar d as semanas meses o a os antes de pasar a los contactos genitales lo importante es que nunca sea una imposici n sino una decisi n bien reflexionada y dialogada un acto libre responsable e informado
6684941 no tenemos que pedir permiso a nadie para distribuirlo es una obligaci n del gobierno hacerlo
6684942 si hay libertad si hay informaci n si ejercemos nuestros derechos si hay equidad de g nero en la relaci n de pareja si cesa la discriminaci n contra personas de preferencia sexual distinta vamos a vivir mejor de eso estamos convencidos
6684943 vamos a empezar a construir un libro ahora para la poblaci n de menor edad en la que hay que tener un enfoque preventivo pero que tengan en cuenta el desarrollo de su sexualidad desde muy temprana edad con informaci n cient fica laica y absolutamente veraz sin mentiras ni tapujos sobre el desarrollo de su sexualidad
6684944 la nica disponible y la m s efectiva se llama prevenci n y educaci n
6684945 tu futuro en libertad por una sexualidad y salud reproductiva con responsabilidad
6684946 oh well i didnt even think about it until after i threw them away
6684947 a full branch plant operation of prime minister stephen harpers ottawa office
6684948 you are distorting the facts and deliberately misleading nova scotians regarding their energy future in a pathetic effort to rehabilitate your diminishing political fortunes
6684949 i want to make sure nova scotians have all the information
6684950 you put in your home heating costs and when you take a look at the impact of the carbon tax you could see upwards to 400 on home heating if you were heating with oil if you were utilizing diesel you are going to see those costs go up
6684951 rattled by what we are saying because this is a very serious issue for nova scotians
6684952 either hes trying to get out of third place in the polls in nova scotia or hes already assuming hes going to lose the next election and hes trying to get a patronage appointment perhaps as ambassador like pat binns got after he lost the premiership of p e i
6684953 he is being completely dishonest and dishonourable he obviously has an agenda more focused on his own self preservation than the interest of nova scotia he is looking for a golden parachute
6684954 were going to fight it every step of the way
6684955 in most cases the infection is pretty mild people might not even be aware they have it
6684956 they might have a mild flu like illness maybe some mild abdominal pain and diarrhea
6684957 i think if people have eaten any of these foods but feel perfectly well they have nothing more to worry about and the vast vast majority of people who have eaten these products will not get sick
6684958 those would be the manifestations of the severe form of the disease when it happens and its fortunately not common but when it happens it can be a very serious life threatening disease
6684959 theres nothing specific about those symptoms that make you say aha thats what this is nothing that really twigs you to say this is listeria
6684960 a lot of people eat cold cuts every day and it doesnt mean that theyre getting listeria from it
6684961 the antibiotics of choice are very simple plain garden variety antibiotics that we dont use much for other things the big drug is ampicillin and the other drug is septra which we use to treat urinary tract infections
6684962 it can be as short as a few days but it may be as long as a couple of months complicating investigation of an outbreak because its very difficult for people to remember what theyve eaten a few weeks or a few months before
6684963 and certainly the food they ingested weeks or months before is not likely to be around in order to do cultures to determine the source
6684964 what they wanted to do with me is to take my livelihood away and everything else
6684965 i dont think thats constructive to somebody whos struggling to take their passion away from them i feel very strongly about that
6684966 thats what i feel is the biggest lesson to be learned everybody does deserve a second chance or a third chance or whatever if you believe that they can actually come back and do some good
6684967 ive been through a really rough time in my life and i think it made me the person that i am today and made me dive like this
6684968 i could see it screwed up the africans out there i was at home as they were all getting cold i live and train in victoria so im good
6684969 what id say is that theyre much more aggressive this fighting season than theyve been in the past
6684970 he loved his girls and it was very hard for him to go away
6684971 exceptional canadians who made a selfless choice to serve their nation
6684972 the difference is theyre not holding any of the ground that they attack us on so in the case of an ied strike they will inflict some casualties but they dont control the road they inflicted the casualties on so really the net effect is zero other than it whittles away at our resolve
6684973 our soldiers believe in this mission they know what this is all about
6684974 at the end of the day the taliban are against things theyre not for anything theyre against human rights theyre against education theyre against health care theyre against women theyre just against human decency so if we leave these people if we leave the population of kandahar province in the hands of the taliban we just wont be performing our duty and our soldiers know that
6684975 they were a well trained highly motivated crew and believed in their mission
6684976 are they effective theyre slowing them down will we still see devices in culverts yes
6684977 the only way you can stop an insurgent from doing what an insurgent does is putting a 24 hour watch on the target we cant do that
6684978 because of the irrigation problems and the wet season and all that other stuff theres culverts all over the place for drainage
6684979 i felt much better yesterday and i came in feeling very positive
6684980 on that second lap though i could feel i was battling but i wasnt in that much pain the energy just wasnt there
6684981 my season is finished and i just want to go home and relax and then start preparing for the world championships in berlin next year
6684982 im not going to blame the flu for my performance because if i had made it i wouldnt have said anything about being sick
6684983 i just had a bad day and that happens sometimes
6684984 i couldnt train for a week because of my injury so im not going to cry my eyes out about not qualifying i had to hold back so i could protect myself
6684985 im not as fast as the other girls are on track so id like to get back to the road
6684986 it is a jihad because this individual should not be given the chance to destroy the countrys political stability and prosperity
6684987 yeah i think you could and if you did that i think youd be the first ones
6684988 it involved shopping and eating in which they were already fluent
6684989 dies ist ein kleiner schritt f r einen menschen ein gro er schritt f r die menschheit
6684990 presiden wan azizah baru umumkan letak jawatan sebagai mp permatang pauh sebentar tadi bagi memberi laluan kepada anwar untuk bertanding dalam piliharaya kecil permatang pauh

6685021 at this moment in my life writing about anything else would be uninteresting and impossible because i feel such urgency
6685022 our music now is not representing the times at least not socially and politically or maybe were just distracted
6685023 i started exercising and i started eating more of the right food and i started feeling better i just get up in the morning and say my prayers
6685024 i think the new album is just as good as anything the beach boys ever recorded
6685025 van dyke parks brian and melinda thought this should be a love letter to los angeles at this point brian was 65 years old and it just felt right to embrace his legend and be a bit nostalgic
6685026 kind of introspective kind of how i feel around people
6685027 yes brian had a rough time of it with his mental health but i would kill to have the kind of catalog he does and tour everywhere with his brothers like he did
6685028 when i go to the keyboard i feel holy like an angel over my head i feel very holy when we did the beach boys hit god only knows i felt holy about that too a godly something comes through me
6685029 im always thinking about melodies the melodies come from my brain and my keyboards i play a really pleasant keyboard it sounds so pleasant it makes me want to write melodies
6685030 i dont talk to them very much i used to i recorded with them at one time but i dont talk to them a lot

6685044 jimmy bond had a big jet boat chase in live and let die
6685045 i did quite a few run throughs to practice and whilst banking on one such run the engine cut out i had no steering i therefore continued in a straight line directly into a wooden boat house
6685046 there i was as a fearless 007 hobbling on a cane to my boat and then pretending to be indestructible for the cameras who says i cant act
6685047 he was a huge bond fan and said that he would love to direct one of the films
6685048 hed recently had great success with jaws and close encounters and was considered a very hot property

6685058 speaking english is like playing tennis with a 30 pound pack on my back usually the balls come down the middle of the court and i have no trouble getting them back but sometimes theres a ball to the side that i have to run for and i cant quite get it and i know that if i werent wearing the pack that is if i were speaking french rather than english id have been able to get to the ball after a while speaking english i get really tired
6685059 no no in my job i have to be bilingual so this actually helps but i dont think ill ever be genuinely bilingual im a speaker of french who can handle english pretty well thats as far as its going to go
6685060 i actually feel like ive leveled off it used to be that every year i got better but now im just staying the same maybe its that im getting older maybe its realizing that however good i get ill never be as good as i am in english and speaking english is such a relief

6685063 i want to find plays that will create an experience intellectual emotional even spiritual
6685064 to keep people talking but i dont know the audience there yet it would be presumptuous for me to say what plays or kinds of plays those would be
6685065 its a place where people are open to new ideas
6685066 debt reduction is a large part of what we need to do
6685067 i believe you need to be committed to the whole institution not just the plays
6685068 im excited by the challenges of fundraising and audience development
6685069 that feels deeply true to the spirit of tennessee williams and at the same time true to itself

6685072 wife i dont know what we were but i know this day that you are mine your gaze and your silence are my own
6685073 perhaps we see everything upside down and the earth is a kind of sky
6685074 you have to engage people not there to see you
6685075 we said this one is for the giants by the end they were all singing along with the refrain la la la
6685076 her music brings together theatrical imagination global awareness and its still playful
6685077 their music really touches on the growing complexity of identity as borders are being crossed at so many different levels
6685078 it was the opposite of california where i felt like the other kids but looked different
6685079 i was the brown girl who kicked ass in math
6685080 at first i felt ridiculous they looked so down and out and here we come with our instruments
6685081 then we finished the first song and everyone went crazy it was one of our best shows
6685082 when shes working she disappears she might not even return phone calls
6685083 ill take up the cd and practice along to it
6685084 as i listened to her heart in the icu she kept asking me how do you make a friend
6685085 i had no answer i eventually wrote a song about questions that cant be answered
6685086 i realized love and death are two things you cant choose and have no control over
6685087 reacting to bush is not as powerful as imagining another way
6685088 i wanted people to appreciate beauty in something they didnt understand
6685089 but i wanted people to google it and find out that its really about torture
6685090 you can hear we are having a good time in our music like a drunken clown just on the verge of falling apart
6685091 i love playing in little cramped places where you can see peoples faces
6685092 i want to take it further how about car washes and elevators
6685093 jesus christ died for my sins and i am redeemed through him
6685094 is just a worldview and everybody has some kind of worldview its important to know what they are
6685095 it does me no injury for my neighbor to say that there are twenty gods or no god it neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg
6685096 if statistics are any indication the system may well be allowing some innocent defendants to be executed
6685097 im having a herpes outbreak but youd never know it
6685098 whenever there is change in the market we see organisations focus more on their financials ms boyd said from wellington new zealand
6685099 we see extra sets of eyes looking at the books and we see that the accounting people are really central to the business
6685100 from experience the accounting industry generally doesnt feel it until 12 months later mr raftery said
6685101 the work required isnt as great because the transactions are smaller ive seen that happen a few times now like in the mid 90s
6685102 being overworked and stressed due to staffing issues is not a winning attraction strategy for anyone in or wanting to enter the profession ms boyd said
6685103 its a very big part of many employers strategies to look at their competitors and look at their staff ms boyd said
6685104 we dont know why the chinese government has blocked itunes but it seems the most logical explanation is that it is because of us
6685105 eww thats nasty i have never ever hooked up with michael phelps
6685106 come on i have really good taste hes really not my type we dont even talk to each other
6685107 im not dating amanda beard i think she has a boyfriend
6685108 that to me is the most striking part about it transmitting 60 watts at 75 percent efficiency over several feet
6685109 the power pack for your laptop isnt that efficient its one of those things thats almost too good to be true
6685110 here is a clear intention to open up the saudi equity market to foreign investors
6685111 we could get clarification very quickly or it could take some time
6685112 no one has formal approval from the cma as yet
6685113 gm has the ability to make a significant positive impact
6685114 this is a state thats good for this sort of business
6685115 its our goal to be as relevant as possible to as many people as we can
6685116 when i have shopped for situations like babies or weddings for gay friends i have good luck in quirky stores
6685117 but if you are just in a generic store the bride and groom symbol or words are in most cards
6685118 it becomes difficult to find some that are neutral but have some style
6685119 the fact that you have someone like hallmark going into that niche shows its growing and signals a trend
6685120 a lot of people think a gay greeting card needs a rainbow on it
6685121 people are finally realizing that this russian situation has the potential to be bad for a very long time
6685122 the russians have shown evidence that theyre willing to cut off energy supplies to advance their aims there is concern that they are now going to be much more assertive in that area
6685123 if military activity heats up again pipeline flows into europe could be disrupted and that would affect the united states as well
6685124 this is probably about it in terms of a retail gas drop we may be a few cents away from the august bottom
6685125 the dollars rise was too swift to have faith in
6685126 the resumption of the currencys fall has increased the appeal of hard assets
6685127 frankly if i had perfect foresight i would never have taken this job in the first place

6685129 competition concerns in relation to the global seaborne supply of iron ore
6685130 to the extent the proposed acquisition lessens competition in the global seaborne supply of iron ore it would be likely to have the effect of increasing global iron ore prices
6685131 vi har ikke f et nogen forklaring fra ibm endnu jeg vil ikke begive mig ud i spekulationer om hvad der for rsagede nedbruddet jeg kan ikke komme med konkrete forklaringer da jeg ikke ved hvad den pr cise rsag er
6685132 en butiksk de som synoptik har et butikssystem et erp system kalender og mailsystemer og s videre der var ingen ting der virkede da man ikke kunne logge p
6685133 det var altomfattende da ingen kunne logge p vi startede med at prioritere hvad der er vigtigst p et tidspunkit skiftede vi fra katastrofestatus til oprydningsstatus
6685134 i l bet af mandag og tirsdag var der var s mange der kunne arbejde relativt normalt at oprydningsfasen startede
6685135 vi har et sted mellem 250 og 300 butikker s der g r noget tid inden vi er helt f rdige men oprydningsarbejdet lakker mod enden vi har nydt godt af et fleksibelt personale og t lmodige kunder
6685136 we always carried ourselves in a very ladylike manner very professional we dressed in a certain way didnt want to be cleavaged and all that
6685137 they see me in hair curlers they see me dressed to the nines they see me on the bus they see me at the church i usher them in and some of them do a double take
6685138 i took care of the business lets just say i never deserted the group
6685139 i believe in being on time taking care of business
6685140 i loved those days youd walk down the street from the brill building and you never knew whod you run into bobby darin one of the coasters one of the drifters
6685141 of course we got sidelined by the beatles thats when we started working those colleges and we didnt turn to disco neither when that came along
6685142 were already out in customers homes theyre buying plasma tvs and connecting pcs with peripherals and printers
6685143 were now able with connectech to install service connect their devices optimize the service and really bring out the full value of what theyve purchased
6685144 there are a lot of people who have entered the service arena but have not gone far because its much harder to make this work
6685145 everyone can say they want to offer service but the first question you have to answer is are you going to own it or outsource it
6685146 obviously telecom providers are trying to take their services up the value curve but theyre also taking their customers up the learning curve
6685147 as you move up the learning curve unless you have sophisticated end users many will need help
6685148 that to me is the most striking part about it transmitting 60 watts at 75 percent efficiency over several feet
6685149 its a tragic end to a programme that dozens of people have put their hearts and souls into
6685150 everyone is very connected to this animal and it is a very emotional decision
6685151 its a bit like if you have got a family pet when the vet says to you there is nothing more we can do and the animal is suffering ive taken the decision that i dont want to prolong the agony of this animal
6685152 its patience and background and just being soaked in the technology
6685153 increasing broadcasting revenue has been the major reason for the leagues success
6685154 the time works out great for asia which is by far the largest potential market compared with africa and the americas
6685155 perhaps if he had faced serious journalistic scrutiny instead of media cheerleading barack obama might still have won his partys nomination
6685156 but the tremendously positive coverage that the networks bestowed upon his campaign was of incalculable value the early celebrity coverage helped make obama a nationally known figure with a near perfect media image
6685157 barack obama addresses the controversial comments of his pastor condemning the words but not the man and he calls on all americans to work for a more perfect union
6685158 in the city of brotherly love barack obama gave the most extensive and most intensely personal speech on race he has ever given
6685159 from a reporters point of view its almost hard to remain objective because its infectious the energy i think
6685160 you can see it in the crowds the thrill the hope how they surge toward him and the question you can sense on everyones mind as they listen so intently to him is he the one
6685161 and today the audacity of hope had its rendezvous with destiny the kennedy clan anointed barack obama a son of camelot
6685162 barack obama and his wife michelle walked into historys arms last night just like jfks journey as the first catholic president america crossed a milestone one of americas oldest and ugliest color lines has been broken and theres a new bridge for a new generation

6685166 the seemingly softer tone to the committees discussion in keeping with a more muted outlook in the inflation report does seem to have pretty much ruled out any prospect of a rate hike which was already slim as it would risk an unnecessarily deep downturn
6685167 although we envisage the first rate cut next year there is every chance that the mpc begins to cut as early as november especially if commodity prices continue to fall and economic activity falters as expected
6685168 concerns about demand were a more important factor in restraining investment than restrictions in the supply of credit although credit was becoming harder to obtain
6685169 ours is different from video because their final product looks exactly the same
6685170 the dvd is the same as if you downloaded it
6685171 we want people to see these stories through as many distribution points as possible
6685172 and i was right it was the hardest job i could find
6685173 i worked all night and on the weekends and had all the tombstones ads that appear in financial publications following a deal to prove it
6685174 i was having a really macho career i was in the right place and now i sort of feel like i have other fish to fry
6685175 opt out patterns across careers labor force participation rates among educated mothers
6685176 there are plenty of women out there who have made it work but they all have their own individual stories whether its a nanny a stay at home dad or working it out with an individual manager who happens to have gone through the same thing
6685177 its all very one off the infrastructure is not there in the business world and thats what has yet to rise up in these industries
6685178 if home prices were going up and you could hold on to a house for a long time you might be able to make a case that its a better time to buy
6685179 but if you have the ability to rent for half the price without the liabilities that go with owning its a smarter decision to rent
6685180 people feel nervous about trying to time the bottom of the housing market but they dont need to feel that urgency
6685181 a year from now they can come back to the market and theyre not going to lose anything

6685203 the mecca verses should now be made the basis of the law and the medina verses should be abrogated this counter abrogation will result in the total conciliation between islamic law and the modern development of human rights and civil liberties in this sense we reformers are superfundamentalists

6685335 getting vaccinated is the safest thing we can do for children
6685336 at the national level i am concerned about our situation
6685337 every year the u s experiences importation of measles what is different this year is once it is imported we are seeing it spread to more people and most of that spread is to people under 20
6685338 this highlights that even with extremely high vaccine levels we could have sizable pockets of people contract measles
6685339 similar to whats happening in israel it could result in much higher outbreaks than we have now
6685340 one of the reasons that some parents have withheld measles vaccines is they believe that the risk is very low
6685341 i think that publicity about concerns about the safety of vaccines has contributed to parents delaying or deferring the vaccine for their children
6685342 unfortunately parents are not considering the risks of the disease

6685349 spores lucy bradshaw talks about why the games developers embraced an old programming technique the creature creator the first piece of electronic arts highly anticipated evolution game spore launched tuesday created by will wright whos known for the video games simcity and the sims spore begins with a player controlling a single celled organism and progresses through various evolutionary stages until the player controls an entire space faring race the creature creator part of the game consists of a modeling interface that lets players build their own organisms from a set of highly customizable and flexible parts when wright first began talking about spore in 2005 he expressed a vision of extreme player control rather than having game designers build thousands of 3 d models of creatures in advance and program their behavior he had the staff develop algorithms to animate the creatures that players built using a technique called procedural generation

6685360 we had some tomatoes and i thought about using those and i had a neighbor who was always talking about doing a garlic beer so we added that i had some fresh oregano some basil an old packet of yeast

6685362 the first time we tasted it we looked at each other and said you know its actually good
6685363 none of them worked so i said you know what lets pop open one of those tomato beers we gave it one taste and i said holy s this is fantastic its perfect with pizza
6685364 thats basically one bottle at a time because most people dont buy a whole case
6685365 you dont have to be a card carrying member of the social register to dine here but if you are not you will most likely be in the minority
6685366 there has been concern about young women getting raped in greece

6685375 my best moment i have a lot of good moments but the one i prefer is when i kicked the hooligan
6685376 i didnt study i live you cant study these things life teaches them to you you dont find them in a book ive read a lot of socrates on page 3 of the sun
6685377 football is like making love if you cant last 90 minutes like me you wont win
6685378 i let the people decide how good the food is
6685379 there are a lot of scare cards on the turn that i can win the pot with and also at that time i thought my table image was good
6685380 with jamie in there i kind of thought i could win that hand regardless my particular table image to jamie is probably that he thinks im not putting my chips in bad so i can manipulate certain situations that i need to board permitting
6685381 i know i have to call fast because i know dicken has a piece of it
6685382 i know he doesnt have the three 9s i know hes not going to be able to overcall
6685383 i think the main lesson is to call fast so you dont get overcalled behind you
6685384 in that spot to me it was very very obvious that jamie was bluffing so i have to auto call so i dont allow the person on my left to overcall with a better hand
6685385 you have to play both players in that spot you cannot delay call in that spot because if you delay call it allows the other player to process things and hed call with two pair or something

6685392 one of the reasons i took on the recent broadway revival of cat on a hot tin roof was to prepare for this concert tour to learn how to face a live audience
6685393 but music came second came into my life long before acting and if it came down to doing just one thing full time it would be great to make music the story of my life not necessarily always recording myself but also helping other people make music financing people to do their own thing thats where the truth lies in the diversity of your imagination
6685394 the reason music has become so mediocre is that everybodys doing the same song theyre not learning from their own experience and from the mistakes of others but it doesnt have to be that way
6685395 a rap album and a rick rubin or neptunes production
6685396 like jim croce jon lucien and terry callier cat stevens richie havens bill withers james taylor paul simon and bob dylan they might not have all had the most melodic of voices but they all are masters at delivering a message of truth and complexity
6685397 whos accomplished his goals and dreams who has many options but lacks the spiritual foundation to do whats most important
6685398 no matter how the album does theyll never be able to take this experience from me from us

6685642 mistook the silence in kashmir as a return of peace
6685643 india and pakistan sooner or later will have to talk to the kashmiris and solve the dispute our aspirations have to be taken into consideration

6685654 its easy to say that but we dont have any evidence everytime we sent spies they always end up missing or being killed so we want you to take this case
6685655 well if i say that this case is related to your sisters death
6685656 your sister died in a car accident however a witness saw ishikawa crews in that car so they might be involved with your sisters death
6685657 even though ishikawa kazuko is a dangerous man but he has a daughter named rika and he loves her a lot she goes to an all school girl named gakuhou high school we want you to get close to her and if you have a chance then investigate her father

6685679 el elevado n mero de vuelos retrasados las escalas programadas en tiempos que se escapan a la realidad la falta de recursos calidad de medios en tierra los reiterados aogs en las flotas la escasez de tripulaciones y el sistema de movimientos de los tripulantes para lograr una tripulaci n concreta hacen que el sentimiento general sea de caos operativo que hace poner en riesgo el pasaje raz n de ser de spanair

6685685 yo estuve toda la noche con una familia que hab a perdido a dos personas
6685686 entre las familias muchas veces se ayudan esos casos son los mejores porque entre ellos se apoyan de una forma m s natural ya que realmente comparten un dolor explica la psic loga nosotros aunque seamos profesionales y sepamos en todo momento c mo debemos actuar no dejamos de ser un apoyo artificial y puntual
6685687 ante todo hay que tener en cuenta una cosa y es que pase lo que pase son reacciones normales ante una situaci n que no lo es
6685688 que es que aqu la gente ya sab a que su familiar hab a muerto s lo faltaba que se lo confirmaran
6685689 s lo se invita a reconocer a los cad veres que son reconocibles
6685690 a nadie se le pide que reconozca un miembro seccionado y calcinado de un familiar como se ha podido leer en algunas informaciones
6685691 s lamente han pasado a reconocer a las personas que son reconocibles existe un protocolo muy riguroso de hecho solo se permiten ver la cara y en algunos casos excepcionales las manos los forenses hacen un trabajo incre ble de maquillaje para facilitar las cosas a la familia
6685692 lo importante es que las familias sufran lo menos posible los miedos siempre est n ah y claro que ser n atendidos sobre todo en el caso de la gente que volar supone su medio de vida pero lo importante ahora es que las personas que han perdido a alguien lo superen y se sientan arropados en todo momento

6685700 its unlikely that a broadcast network is ever again going to create a megahit like the cosby show which at its mid 80s peak drew as many as 50 million viewers an episode for several years now tvs top event has been foxs american idol last season it drew 28 8 million viewers a week
6685701 in many ways the networks themselves already have specific brand identities they just dont admit it for decades cbs has had the most elderly demographic among the major networks abc specializes in comedies and light dramas with strong female appeal fox with the exception of american idol is largely aimed at guys the fledgling cw is building on gossip girl and americas next top model to chase young women nbcs struggles are not unrelated to the fact that its still trying to be all things to all people

6685716 the groups profit performance in the first half of the year was strong and ahead of most estimates despite the general economic tightening in the united states and western europe in the second quarter
6685717 the prospects for 2009 remain less certain particularly if the united states and western european economies continue to be impacted by the financial crisis and commodity price increases
6685718 in mid 2009 the financial markets may start to rebound and 2010 in the real world continues to look better
6685719 2010 has the prospect of the impact of mini quadrennial events such as the fifa world cup in south africa the winter olympics in vancouver the mid term congressional elections in the united states the world expo in shanghai and the asian games in guangzhou
6685720 i will guarantee you that metrowest legislators will do everything in our power to keep the turnpike authority from singling out metrowest commuters for a toll increase which is what the effect would be of removing the discount program
6685721 i understand the turnpike authority is in a very difficult fiscal situation but eliminating the fast lane discount should be off the table
6685722 we are the most affected its patently unfair that the metrowest has to bear this burden to begin with to pay for the big dig
6685723 the authority is at or close to bleeding red ink
6685724 they need to look at ways to close the gap between revenues and expenses
6685725 but this is an equity issue for metrowest commuters and i think they have a valid concern
6685726 since the global price of steel is softening we do not see any immediate reason to go for any upward revision instead the companies should think in terms of further reduction in the prices of steel
6685727 we had a great quiet come to jesus kind of conversation with each other
6685728 we were both feeling like there was some blood on the floor after the casino vote
6685729 we agreed to apologize for some of the things both of us said and we agreed to put the past behind us we decided to get back to work together to get back to being friends
6685730 we have seen over the last several months a lot more willingness to compromise and willingness to take his lumps and move on
6685731 that strikes me as reflective of hard work and the word that comes to mind is maturity
6685732 sometimes it is a guy thing like the new kid on the block
6685733 now they get along very well they have both gone through a lot
6685734 in the last couple of months he has shown all the intellectual and political skills as well as the courage that i saw in him as a candidate
6685735 it took a while to get his feet under him it is certainly very encouraging
6685736 i agree the past is the past lets move forward in partnership and friendship
6685737 hes a human being i know that was affecting him
6685738 we talked often through that sometimes you just pick up the phone in the morning on the way in and check in hes done the same for me
6685739 we are trying to manage in a spare straightforward way
6685740 were trying to fulfill our commitments but we dont have a lot of cash at the moment
6685741 we feel that this is the closest thing to our mission in terms of educating the public about horticulture
6685742 we are planning to have it in some form or another the location may be different the size may be different the timing may be different
6685743 ive picked up more hours this summer trying to make the money back its hard to think that theyd just turn on you like this
6685744 i cant make it a gift to them i dont even have that much in taxes
6685745 there has been a lot of mismanagement on a lot of levels
6685746 the fact is what we the board of trustees saw on paper was not the actual state of affairs
6685747 its not easily done but its certainly one of the considerations
6685748 but we need to find a way to keep it that way it came at a price
6685749 we want to have the tools to fix the problem in case the fishery collapses
6685750 what is your survival rate that was really really hard to prove

6685752 u nlike other cupcake imitators around the world who ceased using modern dot after being caught by sprinkles famous cupcakes has not responded to repeated requests to promptly stop using its trademarked design
6685753 we dont know what to expect on demand but we have had a flood of interest our motive is not to flaunt ourselves or our religion before the world we have to make a living the same as everyone does

6685762 people are very much encouraged by the new face of the campaign because they were not happy with the original theory of im not going to be aggressive im not going to attack
6685763 everybody felt that if he did that he would have a tough time winning

6685773 police and the information commissioner richard thomas have been informed
6685774 the systems theory of management is built upon the tenet that the whole is more than the sum of its parts
6685775 the army and police arrested a suspected bomber not far away from scene of the attack
6685776 they also recovered a suicide jacket from a nearby mosque and seized explosives
6685777 the army has killed hundreds of innocent people and we attacked it to teach it a lesson
6685778 im tripping out because i cant walk in the store
6685779 people scream at me and do things we did in the movie
6685780 we were the first to do something like this its ghetto fabulous but my next project is going to be off the chain
6685781 at first they were laughing at me now everybody wants to get involved
6685782 im always experimenting i dont want to sound like everybody else its either going to work or its not if not its back to the lab

6685789 crawfish boils are always a social affair and lately so are kayaking and backpacking forays into acadiana cajun creole country
6685790 the city is booming with jobs too its one of the few in louisiana with population growth
6685791 you would be amazed at how people react to the fact that we have a symphony here
6685792 we have great culture and entertainment and people are looking for things that make them want to live in the community
6685793 but kayaking in lafayette is not something people expect to get when they visit
6685794 now it is easier than ever to find a guide to take you out on a swamp or kayaking when at first it used to be only the ones who could do those activities going out there on the water
6685795 business owners say lafayette is unquestionably one of the best growing cities in the state of louisiana
6685796 and with our city being located right the crossroads of i 10 and i 49 it is a good location for businesses
6685797 we have had an increase in wages increase in jobs and increased interest and that is the combination that you want
6685798 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6685799 i decided that we could not take a risk with all those kids in that building so i sent units to do a fire watch
6685800 we had to notify the state to make sure this is a reputable company
6685801 we will work at it until they get it right
6685802 im sure its disappointing in the williams household to see this draw
6685803 its very disappointing for me to miss the u s open ive always done well in this tournament
6685804 the life of srila prabhupada is pointed proof that one can be a transmitter of truth and still be a vital and singular person srila prabhupada is one in a thousand maybe one in a million
6685805 ive been to four olympics so i think i have an idea of what goes into how hard a wrestler trains and prepares for that moment
6685806 this is a tragedy for that kid and it has to be extra painful because i know daniel takes representing the united states very seriously
6685807 i dont feel adequate to say something on daniel concerning what hes been through because im not sure i have the right words
6685808 when youve been through what it takes to become an olympian and you see something like this happen all i can say is i have a lot of compassion for him
6685809 i spoke with the u s olympic teams chief medical officer dr william kuprevich and hes certain that this isnt something that just happened he thinks this is something that was there before
6685810 obviously theres something going on with daniels kidneys but hes out of the critical stages now daniels in a lot better shape now and thats a big relief for everyone
6685811 it looks like its something thats been there for awhile but what it is no one is certain we just have to get him well and get him home and then well take him to the experts and find out why this happened
6685812 i was fine with the weight loss i mean going up and down in weight so many people do it im not the only guy and with the body fat i carry
6685813 its starting to sound like it was something thats been hidden and just popped up on me we just have to get everything right now get me home and find out what this was all about
6685814 im sure theres a lot of conjecture about how something like this could happen
6685815 but i know for certain bottom line that daniel cormier didnt wake up one morning and decide to get sick and go to the hospital so he couldnt represent his country in the olympic games my heart goes out for him
6685816 this is a terrible thing for an athlete that reaches the highest level of their sport but i think daniel realizes wrestling is just a game and sure this was the olympics but in the end your health is more important than a game wrestling is not life or death despite what some people think
6685817 daniels life will go on and hell do what he wants to do and i know hell be successful at whatever that is hes just a great person and thats more important than winning or losing a wrestling match in my mind
6685818 you work so hard for so long to get to this moment and there are so many people who have put so much into it to help you be successful and this is the outcome
6685819 this is not easy its never going to be easy i just cant understand how this could happen
6685820 continuas presiones y amenazas por parte de la direcci n para que los tripulantes y el personal de mantenimiento transgredieran las normas incluyendo vulneraci n de l mites de actividad violaci n del r gimen de d a libres y vacaciones de los convenios colectivos y de la legislaci n vigentes

6685829 being able to do what ive always wanted to do my entire life is a gift and my whole dream has come true to see where i am from where i was is just crazy
6685830 almost every scene we did selena would say oh my gosh were shooting a movie right now and then it just hit us we met each other the day we started working on our careers so its pretty ironic how things turn out
6685831 everyone on the disney channel is really uplifting people try to pit me against miley but she sent me a four page text saying how she knows its overwhelming right now and she wants to help
6685832 i think kenilworth is predominantly a white middle class town which is where the problem stems from
6685833 the stated aim is to prevent the ordinary british public from telling the truth about what is happening to their lives their communities and to their country
6685834 their aim in other words is to achieve their goals by intimidation
6685835 given the groups full title the message this time is clear the white middle class fascists of kenilworth must not be allowed to protest whenever their town is desecrated by marauding gypsies
6685836 we are pleased to report that sita suez has seen the error of its ways and has agreed to reinstate the three solidarity members immediately without any blemish on their record
6685837 the investigation has been terminated and the attempts by the anti british trade union to punish workers for leaving and joining solidarity has failed our thanks to all those who supported the campaign
6685838 this goes to show the gangsters running the other trade unions that the days of them being able to bully and intimidate british workers is now well and truly over this case marks a turning point in the fight for british worker rights and will resound throughout all industries british workers have the right to join any trade union of their choosing and no one especially not a bunch of fat cat far leftists can force them to do otherwise

6685841 when i was accused of robbing a gas station of 70 i accepted a deal but when time came for sentencing they tossed me into the penitentiary with one to life it was 1960 i was 18 years old i met marx lenin trotsky engels and mao when i entered prison and they redeemed me for the first four years i studied nothing but economics and military ideas i met black guerrillas george big jake lewis and james carr w l nolen bill christmas torry gibson and many many others we attempted to transform the black criminal mentality into a black revolutionary mentality as a result each of us has been subject to years of the most vicious reactionary violence by the state our mortality rate is almost what you would expect to find in a history of dachau three of us nolen sweet jugs miller and cleve edwards were murdered several months ago jan 13 1969 by a pig shooting from thirty feet above their heads with a military rifle

6685843 reformism is an old story in amerika there have been depressions and socio economic political crises throughout the period that marked the formation of the present upper class ruling circle and their controlling elites but the parties of the left were too committed to reformism to exploit their revolutionary potential fascism has temporarily succeeded under the guise of reform
6685844 the fascist must expand to live consequently he has pushed his frontiers to the farthest lands and peoples im going to bust my heart trying to stop these smug degenerate primitive omnivorous uncivil and anyone who would aid me i embrace you
6685845 international capitalism cannot be destroyed without the extremes of struggle we are the only ones who can get at the monsters heart without subjecting the world to nuclear fire we have a momentous historical role to act out if we will the whole world for all time in the future will love us and remember us as the righteous people who made it possible for the world to live on i dont want to die and leave a few sad songs and a hump in the ground as my only monument i want to leave a world that is liberated from trash pollution racism nation states nation state wars and armies from pomp bigotry parochialism a thousand different brands of untruth and licentious usurious economics

6685863 im pleased with the way im going the bowling is fine but a few more runs wouldnt go amiss i definitely feel theres a big score around the corner
6685864 ive had success there in the past and its somewhere im confident i can do a job at the batting got better in the test series but having such a long lay off it had suffered a little bit

6685919 for some of our members its going to cause considerable hardship for the three year period
6685920 what were being offered isnt even allowing us to maintain a decent standard of living a lot of people from other unions have been supporting us
6685921 there are some people who have gone in to work and they dont usually refuse to take a pay rise when it has been successfully fought for but they are by far in the minority
6685922 im more than satisfied by what has happened today and i hear cosla is making noises about going back to the table already
6685923 im confident this action is popular in the community ive heard from one right wing councillor who thought sacking a couple of people would help but that view is way out of line everybody i have spoken to have supported us
6685924 its like saying when the miners went on strike they were only hurting the people who burn coal
6685925 it is but thats the only way workers can make their presence felt
6685926 were disappointed there was a disruption to services caused by the strike action
6685927 in our view its in no ones interests for there to be further disruption least of all people in our communities who rely on services provided by council employees
6685928 in our view the only way to resolve this is by negotiation and we would ask the unions to meet with us to jointly reach a solution to the difficult situation we all find ourselves in
6685929 i would encourage both parties to try to resolve the dispute to ensure that there is no further interruption to public services and i hope that resolution can be achieved by local authorities and their employees
6685930 the world hnefatafl championships will become an annual event on the island of fetlar there has been lots of interest from across the world with radio interviews and emails from places as far away as boston usa we intend to build on this years success and will hold the next tournament in summer 2009 we hope to see wendy defend her title next year

6685934 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6685935 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6685936 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6685937 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6685938 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

6685943 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6685944 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6685945 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6685946 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6685947 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6685948 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6685949 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6685950 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6685951 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6685952 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6685953 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6685954 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6685955 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6685956 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6685957 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6685958 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6685959 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6685960 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6685961 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6685962 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6685963 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6685964 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6685965 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6685966 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6685967 we have a very good relationship with the sic i listen carefully to what convener sandy cluness puts to me and would be happy to have discussions on that subject
6685968 the money isnt readily available but we might be able to see whether they will at least pick up part of the costs
6685969 any of that funding is on a loan basis so we would have to repay it but given a long enough period to do it that might be a way of not using all of our own capital
6685970 but if youre trying to balance a number of different projects at one time and if you want as i think we will to build a number of houses there might not be sufficient funds to do that on our own
6685971 we request interim prime minister commodore voreqe bainimarama to listen to the people of fiji we ask that the interim government should not be militarized if there is a need for more interim ministers then they should consider the concept of gnu which has been mooted earlier as well by civil society organisations
6685972 a gnu would be more inclusive and would promote power sharing this would be a good strategy to move away from military control of government administration it would also be more in line with the concepts of unity and shared values being proposed in the draft charter
6685973 there is no point in advertising of we are not happy that we can give a reasonable service we wouldnt normally advertise during july and august anyway
6685974 there should be a large police detachment possibly with access to firearms inside the complex around the clock
6685975 the scottish police federation considers that security at the base sic is simply a joke
6685976 mr black was speaking as mr black not for the federation we do not subscribe to his views regarding security at sullom voe
6685977 it is not part of the federations remit to advise chief constables how to run their constabularies
6685978 none an office such as this is often a real storm centre and ive had to throw many a bucket of oil on troubled waters
6685979 but in many ways i suppose i will miss it ive made so many friends and contacts through my position
6685980 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
6685981 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6685982 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6685983 you can get a first job maybe a second job but as you try to move onwards and up wards because of the nature of the restricted economy there are perhaps not that many opportun ities
6685984 i dont think theres anything fundamentally different in the two economies but if it looks like were moving in the opposite direction in a negative way we need to try to understand that
6685985 theres not a lot you can do directly in the public sector its the development of careers in the private sector whether its self employed with better prospects of being able to increase specialised skilled areas or finding successful companies and trying to help them to grow to create more opportunities we have to look at all these angles and trade on our best weather in britain
6685986 nobody could have repaired the damage in sufficient time for him to survive
6685987 we didnt have a policy for warming them up we accepted the failure rate
6685988 at that point in time i would not have been alarmed if i had seen that
6685989 i dont think we did anything wrong or i dont think he did anything wrong either

6686001 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo

6686005 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6686006 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano

6686010 i saw this as an opportunity to volunteer my help and get enjoyment i previously had with children in the youth program
6686011 its a very valuable tool for us they look forward to it its community building and its definitely something we want to have were glad to be able to continue it
6686012 ive definitely heard people talk about the class and i look at mdvarsity com
6686013 i ve definitely seen that recruiting has gotten a lot better with some of the new coaches this is probably the greatest recruiting class that s come through the state with the most talent being able to keep as many kids as possible from here is big you get the local people coming out to the games thats huge for the program it just makes it that much better and helps the team
6686014 this year his third year my biggest observation of ryan is that he really took the whole team under his leadership
6686015 he specifically sought this year to help the other two singles players improve their game
6686016 in the beginning of the season he was lacking some confidence
6686017 as he started playing he began to get more confidence he played steadier he is still learning and he is going to be tough to beat next year
6686018 andrew had a great year and it was a great accomplishment for him to get to the semifinals

6686023 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
6686024 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
6686025 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
6686026 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad

6686029 el ment clef dune nouvelle configuration lalimentation est trop souvent mise de c t lors du choix de la machine cest pourtant une des pierres angulaire de la stabilit tout en offrant de fortes variations dun mod le lautre en termes de rendement ou encore de nuisance sonore pour notre premier article dans ce domaine nous avons choisi de nous int resser une gamme particuli re savoir les alimentations modulaires de 500 watts
6686030 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6686031 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6686032 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6686033 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6686034 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6686035 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6686036 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6686037 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6686038 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6686039 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6686040 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6686041 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

6686047 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
6686048 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6686049 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6686050 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6686051 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6686052 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6686053 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6686054 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
6686055 protocolo espec fico adicional sobre recursos h dricos compartidos entre la rep blica de chile y la rep blica argentina
6686056 ning n proyecto de inversi n podr pretender hacerse rentable a costa del medio ambiente incorporaremos el ordenamiento territorial y el manejo integrado de cuencas como eje de nuestra nueva pol tica
6686057 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6686058 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6686059 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6686060 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6686061 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
6686062 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6686063 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6686064 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6686065 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6686066 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6686067 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
6686068 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6686069 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6686070 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6686071 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6686072 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6686073 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6686074 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6686075 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6686076 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6686077 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6686078 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6686079 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6686080 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6686081 we have a number of banks that are still under investigation and we are obviously having conversations about resolution the one thing the people want is their money back quickly
6686082 i blocked it all out its just one of those things where you see everything perfectly and it all seems to be in slow motion
6686083 when he gets on a roll i just pull out my pompons and give a little cheer and keep smiling and clapping
6686084 thats what good blockers do when they get on a roll good luck to you
6686085 you shouldnt regard this as some kind of formal investigation
6686086 simply there have been questions on the table and discrepancies alluded to the ioc simply wants to do due diligence and work with the international federation to 100 percent clarify this situation and put it to rest
6686087 for the time being there is nothing i can add
6686088 the eligibility of the athletes has already been investigated and cleared by the international federation
6686089 the international federation is asking again the national federation to produce evidence for eligibility but so far everything received has demonstrated no problem for the eligibility of these competitors
6686090 it is supposed to be a very highly protected area because of its sensitive nature so i dont know what happened
6686091 she is definitely a more solid player this year and her emotional and mental control of her game has improved
6686092 she practices all year long and has played in numerous tournaments
6686093 she will be ready to challenge both teammate laura simmons and katz next season
6686094 all players had a great respect for her and her game
6686095 she practiced very hard and was a real fighter when match time came she will surely be missed
6686096 shes had another strong season for us and has gotten better each year
6686097 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6686098 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6686099 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
6686100 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6686101 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii

6686107 expects russia to abide by its agreement to withdraw forces
6686108 our draft resolution is a reconfirmation of the six point agreement and theres no territorial integrity in the six principles
6686109 we believe the six principles are clear and already implemented
6686110 what we see on the ground is the result of ambiguity
6686111 we have a presence of so called russian peacekeeping forces at key georgian choke points that will control economic life it will control humanitarian activities thats why clarifications are so important
6686112 there is no bread there is no food no medicine people are dying
6686113 i cannot go on like this anymore i cry every day

6686119 i believe that shetland will be the perfect location to bring up our family
6686120 although i will not officially take up my position until december i will be spending time in shetland at the nafc marine centre in advance to get to know the people and familiarise myself with the position so that i can hit the ground running in december
6686121 we are very fortunate to have secured the services of prof gray having a director of his stature and experience will reinforce our position as a leading provider of training research and advice for the nautical fisheries engineering aquaculture and food industries
6686122 the centre itself provides training and education to support the maritime industries which underpin the economy of shetland under prof grays leadership it will continue to strengthen partnerships with local industries schools colleges and other research and training providers to meet shetlands needs in the most effective way
6686123 i am pleased that prof gray has the experience and understands the importance of education and training to local communities and local businesses
6686124 he will be able to help us ensure that our training programmes are well matched to local needs
6686125 usamos un sistema de digitalizaci n desarrollado por la empresa alemana steinbichler se trata de un esc ner que mediante una especie de pistola proyecta un haz de luz l ser de 100 mil metros de anchura que captura millones de puntos de las zonas que se est n digitalizando esos puntos se van reproduciendo en el ordenador en un programa que reconstruir el patio entero en tres dimensiones
6686126 a simple vista las piezas ser n id nticas porque el l ser captura cuatro o cinco mediciones por mil metro s lo hay algunas limitaciones en las esquinas cuando el sensor colisiona con las paredes pero eso ser inapreciable
6686127 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6686128 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6686129 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6686130 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6686131 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6686132 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6686133 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6686134 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6686135 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6686136 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6686137 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6686138 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6686139 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6686140 en 2006 con motivo del centenario nos reunimos 30 especialistas en ibn jald n para ofrecer una serie de conferencias y reflexiones
6686141 ofrecimos una serie de estudios sobre sus facetas como soci logo economista e historiador tambi n fue un gran pol tico y un personaje excepcional al que reclamaban todos los reyes del norte de frica aquellas reflexiones son las que conforman el libro
6686142 aunque naci en t nez ibn jald n era de origen sevillano
6686143 es curioso que el creador de la sociolog a no sea conocido en espa a porque es una de las grandes figuras de su tiempo y un intelectual conocido en todo el mundo
6686144 fue un hombre de su tiempo pero lo mir con ojos modernos fue de los que vieron las cosas desde otro punto de vista se dio cuenta de que el hombre no act a solo sino en consonancia con la sociedad en la que se mueve tambi n descubri que la historia no la hacen los hombres sino las clases sociales
6686145 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6686146 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6686147 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie

6686156 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6686157 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6686158 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6686159 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6686160 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6686161 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6686162 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6686163 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6686164 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6686165 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6686166 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6686167 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6686168 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6686169 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

6686184 the groups profit performance in the first half of the year was strong and ahead of most estimates despite the general economic tightening in the united states and western europe in the second quarter
6686185 the prospects for 2009 remain less certain particularly if the united states and western european economies continue to be impacted by the financial crisis and commodity price increases
6686186 in mid 2009 the financial markets may start to rebound and 2010 in the real world continues to look better
6686187 2010 has the prospect of the impact of mini quadrennial events such as the fifa world cup in south africa the winter olympics in vancouver the mid term congressional elections in the united states the world expo in shanghai and the asian games in guangzhou
6686188 pdp is considered as pro india party but they lead march to muzafarrabad despite knowing fully well about the baltal land they are busy misleading the people
6686189 this proposal was considered by the government for three long years and finally cleared by two cabinet ministers belonging to pdp later the pdp jumped on the bandwagon with extremists to fuel communal sentiments
6686190 it is opportunist politicians like mufti mohammad sayed who hijacked attempts to promote liberal and modern outlook and cater to fanatic outlook
6686191 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6686192 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6686193 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6686194 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6686195 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6686196 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable

6686217 i havent seen the movie and i wont go see the movie because of what ive heard but i want to add my two cents to the opinions on whether its offensive to the mentally challenged
6686218 i know ben stiller has said that hes making fun of actors not people with disabilities still the movie is geared toward a younger crowd and i fear a lot of those teenagers and college students will leave the theater thinking r ard is an okay word to use its not its taken years to get people to stop using that word

6686221 reports that actor jean reno is in the hospital due to a heart attack are false he is vacationing in the caribbean and went to a local hospital as a precaution for some discomfort he was feeling due to heartburn and gastroenteritis
6686222 it was definitely not a heart attack he is fine and healthy and enjoying the rest of his vacation travelling in the caribbean
6686223 i think he was just enjoying vacation and probably ate a little too much spicy caribbean food
6686224 it was a cigarette case that hitler had given her with a diamond swastika on the top
6686225 i said thats gotta be worth a lot of money and she came out with this revelation when i looked at the history research she had parties where she entertained hitler so she was like a social hostess

6686227 and hell be sitting in on a panel discussion on combating global poverty

6686234 its not my fault that she only has 20 000 to her name

6686238 it must be great to be able to breeze around all the time
6686239 but think about all that power you have to move things and change them you bring movement everywhere you go nothing stays still where you are not unless you die of course if you die down completely then things will stay still
6686240 things usually die down after i leave but do you mean i can still be there and enjoy the calm
6686241 ive realized that things are more peaceful when im not blowing around but somehow less alive too i had to die down to realize that i thought i was just blowing around pointlessly but now i see there are effects when i come and go i sort of wake things up

6686261 however the prospects for 2009 remain less certain particularly if the u s and western european economies continue to be impacted by the financial crisis and commodity price increases
6686262 in addition the new u s president will have to wrestle with twin fiscal and budget deficits in early 2009 and post the olympics chinese growth may slow
6686263 uh ah i was just uh going to put this jar back
6686264 was there someone here like a tv person or something on the red carpet
6686265 yeah right theyre just starting it in the middle of the corridor lamebrain
6686266 oooh miss its just like one of them red carpets at the oscars

6686270 dann kann ich auch besser einsch tzen wie gut das team technisch noch aufgestellt ist
6686271 ich habe vertrauen in das team aufgrund der erfolge 2005 und 2006 jetzt k nnen sie im kampf um platz vier beweisen dass sie immer noch ein starkes team sind
6686272 ich gehe davon aus dass ich auch n chstes jahr f r das team fahren kann ich habe in den letzten vier rennen drei mal gepunktet und renault gezeigt wozu ich in der lage bin wenn ich vertrauen in das auto habe
6686273 thats perhaps an extreme way of saying it i just wanted to live an obscure life in baltimore
6686274 i miss her unbelievably much i cannot even begin to tell you just how much i miss her she is really the love of my life and not being with her not seeing her not holding her is very very very difficult
6686275 he is being tried in the press and he will be already convicted unless he puts his best foot forward
6686276 id be incompetent if i let the police or anyone else speak to him about that
6686277 was given to me by the one person to whom ive always looked up to one person whom ive known since i was small
6686278 i really couldnt tell you perhaps at some point we can do a dna test and find out
6686279 i believe i grew up in new york im quite sure i grew up in new york city
6686280 i dont know what to say about this i dont have a particular knowledge of any of that
6686281 he says im a lion and if i werent so full of antelope and enclosed in here id jump you and your stripy ass and teach you not to keep asking the same questions every single day
6686282 translated the most senior lioness the male lions really were useless all they did was eat and sleep leaving the lionesses to take care of everything else including meaningful communication
6686283 hang on did he just say i was an ass is that what i am a stripy ass it would be sooo amazing to be just one whole animal
6686284 we dont know what you are and to answer your initial question if you look at our information board outside the enclosure it tells you we are african lions panthera leo and we live south of the sahara
6686285 how come all the visitors get to read all about me but i cant see who i am or where i come from its not fair
6686286 she replied triumphantly and started to bounce around her enclosure
6686287 but if we were the same wed be in the same enclosure also arent you bouncing up in the air like a kangaroo because im pretty sure i cant bounce
6686288 nope i cant bounce like that what i can do though
6686289 would you like me to read your board and tell you what you are
6686290 ill just need one little thing before i can tell you what your information board says
6686291 although it does clash rather with your black and white stripy bottom
6686292 i just dont seem to fit in with any of these animals
6686293 they all know what they are called and what they do im just a mixture of a lot of things how do you even give a name to what i am
6686294 because im outside the enclosures the other animals all see parts of you but they are seeing through the grid of their own enclosure so they dont see clearly
6686295 so im not an elephant or a zebra or an aardvark or a kangaroo or a giraffe
6686296 you are susie and there is no one else like you
6686297 but you come first just like an aardvark and you sound the trumpet call to gather the animals together like an elephant and you have a very unique look just like a zebra you have a lot of energy and bounce like a kangaroo and you can see a long way ahead and behind you just like a giraffe
6686298 susie you are a far seeing others gathering energetically influencing uniquely stylish going first leader
6686299 dont use any words you dont need to and um think about pace
6686300 look ive had a short story published im officially in print
6686301 sam i um want to give you something something that has been very uh significant to me i know it doesnt look like much
6686302 id uh id like you to take this home with you today i want you to put this in your home ok do you understand
6686303 its just that i have a confession to make im really sorry but ive been sneaking into your house at night after youve gone to bed you know you never lock that sidedoor from the laundry i noticed it that day the squirrel got in here and i had to chase it out anyway i uh noticed that youre always looking at this stone and that you touch it a lot and um i figured that it was kinda like your muse so ive been borrowing it at night and returning it early in the morning so you wouldnt notice that its gone and ive been writing with it next to me at home and oh my gosh after everything youve done for me and i just feel so awful so you see you really cant give it to me cos i dont deserve it
6686304 i know its probably just superstition but i figured that if it helped inspire you it might work for me it seemed like everything i write here in close proximity to it turns out really good
6686305 it helps me tremendously in fact i was going to tell you when it was finalised but it looks like ive got a book deal with a publisher ive written the first 5 chapters at home at nights with your trusty stone by my side
6686306 astonishing well then my boy you must definitely have the stone on one condition
6686307 that you never never bring it back into my home ever again ok
6686308 now if youll excuse me ive got a book to finish
6686309 i was elated about the whole thing cause i have always been a fan of usain the night before i said that he was going to break the world record and that is exactly what he did
6686310 watch that man bolt he is a runaway train cant you see the beijing track is on fire thank you father for the lightning bolt him at 6 feet 5 inches that aint no giant olympic world record 9
6686311 i am sure that we are going to get more songs as the day progresses there is no other gen re of music in which the artistes do this they are making our history themselves by making these songs in a number of years we can draw back on this and reminisce
6686312 i did it because wi win and mi proud a history a create right now so this is a tribute to them for their efforts
6686313 im sorry i was a jerk to you is there room at all for just one more chance
6686314 where is her office and would she want to have some lunch tomorrow
6686315 so im just supposed to wait around and see what happens
6686316 yea but we were hanging out and everything was great and you knew you had my full attention what happens if you just let it fade out and forget about me
6686317 it goes to the labs overall ability to control contamination
6686318 the states attorney is unclear so far as to the scope of the contamination and its effect on open and closed cases
6686319 if the quality control practices were so deficient to allow their own dna in theyve also got problems that would allow cross contamination involving other suspects
6686320 they absolutely have the potential to cross contaminate and wrongfully convict someone
6686321 yeah i wish we could find someone for my friend deanne
6686322 what do you think about lining her up with your friend bill
6686323 i mean dont you think they would be perfect together they are both such good members of the church they would be so cute tell me something i dont know about him
6686324 that is probably no big deal he works so much he cant watch them much anyways
6686325 it always drove deanne nuts how much her last boy friend worked and when he wasnt working she complained that he often wanted to watch sports instead of do other things
6686326 honey you know i cant understand you when you talk with your mouth full
6686327 she dated a guy like that it sounds like bill really is her type
6686328 they would be so cute together lets set them up
6686329 al citi reitera que ferrovial vale un 130 m s de lo que dice e
6686330 we had a big heavy cement septic tank for our fishing camp
6686331 the water got to it rolled it over and over and the last we saw of it it was headed out to sea
6686332 it seems to me the proposal has a timely significance as a public works it would certainly encourage the people of ocean city who have suffered severe property damage
6686333 hi sweetie its time here just reminding you youve got plenty of me theres no rush no pressure dont feel you have to get it all done today ill still be here tomorrow so just put the to do list down and make yourself a cup of love my love why dont you and yes you do have time i said so myself love ya
6686334 give me a break im allowed to stop and sit down for a few minutes
6686335 hey you i thought id come and sit with you a while
6686336 i have the feeling youve been having a tough version of me
6686337 honey you know im always here for you dont you
6686338 of course not who in their right mind would run out on you youre totally fabulous
6686339 you sure are i certainly couldnt pass you by even if i tried
6686340 you know what to say to cheer a girl up
6686341 well thats true but you have also just drunk an awful lot of infusion there so that helps
6686342 i guess it helped made me cry a whole lot i didnt think it was supposed to do that
6686343 i guess it helps you do what you need to to feel better
6686344 i cant believe i just get to pour this thing out anytime i need it its priceless you know
6686345 why dont you leave it out on the table so you can grab it just when you need it
6686346 just breathe wait everything is going to be ok trust me ive seen a lot of things in my name
6686347 but but i thought i thought pain had broken it
6686348 lets see what do you know about me again he asked with a twinkle
6686349 looks like your cat has run out on you pain has left the building
6686350 i dont know theyre just not really me long haired purebreds theyre a bit fancy for me dont you think
6686351 because my lovely sweetness and light are exactly your style and that is just what i am going to bring you come on lets go
6686352 there must be something here even if i cant see it there must be
6686353 i dont believe ive been on a wild goose chase there is something here that everybody has missed because its so well hidden
6686354 you cant always see whats going on but sometimes you just feel it
6686355 i know that it is tempting to give up but i think if you really press in youre going to hear something that will help you
6686356 i want to know i want to see what has been hidden here for so long
6686357 i dont want to be here i dont want to be here
6686358 please dont make me stay daddy dont make me stay i dont want to be here im afraid im trapped im trapped in this house im trapped under a veneer of politeness everything is clean and ordered and polite but underneath the surface i am screaming to get out let me out
6686359 ah ok well just thought id let you know that great aunty bettina just called and she and bob have decided to put grandmas house on the market at last i didnt even know it was still in the family till you found it out i have no idea why theyve been keeping it around like a mausoleum for years grandma never liked that house even though it was her first home when she got married
6686360 well uh funny question um i suppose so nobody really said anything about that kind of thing in those days i think they had a good life together very respectable and all that im not too sure how they met in the first place i have a feeling her father may have arranged the marriage she absolutely adored her father just like you poppet
6686361 and i expect she never wanted to leave home in the first place because of that but yes he was a good man her husband
6686362 ah its just i found something hidden under the wallpaper thats all something that could never be expressed
6686363 but its been said now speak to you later dad
6686364 what this does is give producers and processors one more tool in the toolbox to make these commodities safer and protect public health
6686365 who right now may be afraid to eat uncooked produce
6686366 its one big step forward in improving the safety of fresh produce
6686367 getting vaccinated is the safest thing we can do for children
6686368 at the national level i am concerned about our situation
6686369 every year the u s experiences importation of measles what is different this year is once it is imported we are seeing it spread to more people and most of that spread is to people under 20
6686370 this highlights that even with extremely high vaccine levels we could have sizable pockets of people contract measles
6686371 similar to whats happening in israel it could result in much higher outbreaks than we have now
6686372 one of the reasons that some parents have withheld measles vaccines is they believe that the risk is very low
6686373 i think that publicity about concerns about the safety of vaccines has contributed to parents delaying or deferring the vaccine for their children
6686374 unfortunately parents are not considering the risks of the disease
6686375 a bunch of mormon bombshells walking around in modest one piece swimsuits youre kidding right
6686376 what should be done about the fact that in the united states one out of five members of the mormon church cannot find utah on the map
6686377 i personally believe that u s mormons are unable to do so because some people out there in our church dont have maps in the back of their scriptures and i believe that our education like such as primary and the mutual everywhere like such as and i believe that they should our education over here in the u s should help the u s members this will help the members help south africa it should help the iraq and the asian countries so we will be able to build up our future for our children such as
6686378 youd sure like to think theyre taking care of taxpayers money a little better than it appears
6686379 i think there are going to be some pretty serious questions
6686380 i dont doubt for one second they need to be replaced
6686381 i think theres a strong indication that you probably need some new helicopters but i dont know if you can tell the extent of that need
6686382 is 12 the right number i dont know how bad are the 12 you have now they dont have those kinds of records
6686383 we were unable to see if they had to turn down calls or anything like that
6686384 we cant point to a case where they didnt perform but we just think management should have a lot more information to allow them to make decisions in running the place
6686385 the medical system and university are losers in this battle in the sense that its going to take a long time to get everyone back together
6686386 but theyve got people in place now to see that that happens
6686387 theres a strong feeling that he has just the right kind of personality and skills that we need to build a strong relationship between the medical school and community hospitals
6686388 one of the key things is to work with the medical institutions
6686389 its not a separate empire operated by powerful people on a board of directors headed by powerful businessmen
6686390 its not surprising that the system is self destructing largely because the watchdogs the general assembly and the governor and the board of directors allowed things to go on
6686391 so long as our picture looks like those found in every other mormons home
6686392 we recently had a wedding in the family and the photographer threw this in as a bonus
6686393 hey visitor to my home i am a mormon cant you tell by this photo
6686394 were seeing a lot more spread that is concerning to us
6686395 this year we certainly have had parents asking more questions
6686396 today insert the name of the bride married her best friend
6686397 tomorrow insert the name of the bride wont be able to get that slob off of the couch
6686398 today insert the name of the groom married his best friend
6686399 i mean it with every fiber of my being there is no place like being here on the fourth of july you are incredible people
6686400 for the abundant rains we received these past weeks and for the blanket of snow that now covers thy majestic mountain peaks
6686401 ive never heard the like in all my 87 years in the lords church
6686402 there are certain standards were expected to uphold and christensens conduct flies in the face of it
6686403 that moisture is the proper term in prayer moisture plain and simple thats the language the lord has specified
6686404 but still we cant allow our youth to be compromised by exposure to such lax standards
6686405 brother christensen has offended many and i expect to hear an apology from the pulpit come next fast and testimony meeting
6686406 im not alone say it one more time im not alone
6686407 friggin lunatic driver in the parking lot at r c willey
6686408 i feel disappointed over jc penneys victorias secret style television spots for lingerie
6686409 is it just me or does it seem to anyone else of the male gender that as soon as spring starts rolling around and the trees start budding and the flowers start blooming that something else very exciting happens beautiful women start popping up all over the place like flowers coming out of the ground
6686410 i have taken a small survey among men a convenience sample for all you stats people out there and found the general consensus to be in the affirmative we as single women seeking men have been on the hunt since it is openseason all winter long only to come up empty handed fortunately for us sometime around april every year good looking single women start coming out of the woodwork like you wouldnt believe
6686411 where theyve been all winter no one knows one hypothesis is that the cold temperatures have caused them to migrate south with the birds to warmer places like las vegas san diego or maybe phoenix the important thing is theyre back what i want to know is in what cave do all these pretty girls hibernate during the winter and how can we get access to it next winter
6686412 somebodys got a voodoo doll out there against the united states
6686413 its true we live inside the atmosphere of the sun
6686414 if were going to live inside the suns atmosphere we need to learn more about it especially how to predict the storms
6686415 going to launch a fleet of weather stations spacecraft that observe different aspects of suns atmosphere
6686416 solar activity is a bit like a puppet show if you want to understand the motion of the puppets you need to see the strings on the sun the invisible strings are magnetic fields they penetrate the suns atmosphere guiding the flow of heat and orchestrating mighty explosions sdo will be able to produce detailed maps of magnetism on the sun revealing the strings for all to see
6686417 right now sdo is in a thermal vacuum chamber getting tested for the rough ride to space
6686418 no spacecraft has ever been as close to the sun as solar probe plus will go only 7 million km from the surface thats unexplored territory and we expect to learn a great deal about the suns atmosphere by going there
6686419 imagine trying to figure out earths climate by watching only one side of the planet impossible yet thats what weve been doing with the sun
6686420 weve just finished the science and technology definition team report which lays out the whole strategy for solar sentinels
6686421 theres no point in studying the sun if you dont understand what it does to earth
6686422 right now we have our hands full with the others
6686423 how nice it is great to see mormons trying to accommodate the deaf person in the ward
6686424 a lot of pot roast potatoes and jell o molds
6686425 why would you think that please dont tell my wife
6686426 the word of wisdom is kind of like a health code
6686427 eat drink and be merry for tomorrow we will be in utah
6686428 ref are you friggin blind that big oaf is clobbering them

6686436 your run on television was equally impressive as ken jenningss run your skill as a musician is on par with donny and robert jarvik the inventor of the artificial heart was a really smart mormon so brooke what ever your middle initial is white whether you go back to being a nanny or whether we see you next headlining at some big concert in provo on pioneer day mormons salute you
6686437 the medical system and university are losers in this battle in the sense that its going to take a long time to get everyone back together
6686438 but theyve got people in place now to see that that happens
6686439 theres a strong feeling that he has just the right kind of personality and skills that we need to build a strong relationship between the medical school and community hospitals
6686440 one of the key things is to work with the medical institutions
6686441 its not a separate empire operated by powerful people on a board of directors headed by powerful businessmen
6686442 its not surprising that the system is self destructing largely because the watchdogs the general assembly and the governor and the board of directors allowed things to go on
6686443 athletes should be using their influence as role models to promote physical activity and healthy eating among kids
6686444 its a shame that michael phelps is using his celebrity to peddle junk food to children
6686445 the fact is most american kids arent burning 10 000 calories a day in the pool and the gym phelps is sending exactly the wrong message to children eat sugary cereal and you too can achieve athletic excellence he should be encouraging kids to eat more fresh fruits and vegetables and whole grains
6686446 theres never been anything like it before and never anything like it again
6686447 i said to my husband what do you mean no women
6686448 it opened every door that was ever opened for me professionally
6686449 its a different world but we still want to promote the city
6686450 foucault continually increased the accuracy of this method over 50 years his final measurement in 1926 determined that light traveled at 299 796 km s
6686451 how adorable did you spray him down with the hose
6686452 instead of waiting for him to call you why dont you call him
6686453 may i please speak with mr jason v the first
6686454 i am on you didiot this is jason v the
6686455 but but your voice the dulcet tones its remarkable sweetness and yet strength
6686456 overworked vocal chords virus late nights too much adulation out for rest of season goodbye
6686457 our star has been extinguished our songbird has been caged
6686458 i mean im not glad that jason is sick not at all but suddenly something about it all struck me as silly i mean i know hes important but the thing about an orchestra
6686459 isnt the thing about an orchestra that its well an orchestra not a one man band
6686460 um its just there are so many of us all here ready and waiting and actually we are all very good at what we do too
6686461 i think if youre all up for it we could probably just carry on without him
6686462 that we are an orchestra and not a one man band
6686463 but the conductor is indicating that you should move seats
6686464 would you do us the honour of playing first violin
6686465 i think it is only fitting my dear that you lead us out
6686466 and we would be very glad to be led by someone who can lead an orchestra and not just be a one man band
6686467 lets hear it for fiddle de fi three cheers hip hip hip hip hip hip
6686468 would you like a side salad with your ranch dressing
6686469 thank fiction youre still open ive got the whole family coming around for dinner tonight monica has been going steady with malcolm for 6 months straight now and shes finally invited his parents around to meet us its quite an event
6686470 i need the best leg of lamb that you have ive got to make dinner for ten and if i dont get the potatoes peeled soon
6686471 im all out of lamb no excuses i havent got a leg to lean on heh heh if you see what i mean
6686472 oh but mr sainsbury i have to have a leg of lamb monicas malcolms parents minny and me i think me is short for mel are coming to dinner and i need one
6686473 mr sainsbury remembered that in fact he did have a lovely leg of lamb left it was one that hed been saving because it was such a large and tasty leg of lamb but because mrs o leary was so beautiful
6686474 he decided to let her have the leg of lamb that was hidden under the counter
6686475 i have reason to believe mrs o leary that you have just created a fiction infraction section 33303 namely perverting the course of the narrative in order to solve your own problem not only that but you have also shown a shocking disregard for the characterisation of mr sainsbury the butcher who clearly wouldnt forget about a piece of meat and leave it under the counter nor
6686476 nor would mr sainsbury contravene the accurate descriptions act of 2003 by describing you mrs o leary as beautiful even in an internal monologue
6686477 you have the right to remain silent and in fact jolly well ought to do so
6686478 and then suddenly timmy understood that his mummy didnt want him to touch the tv so he just stopped doing it and played nicely with his toys while his mother had a gin and tonic to recover
6686479 at teatime timmy sat in his highchair and waited quietly while his mother fixed his dinner then he ate all his broccoli and didnt throw any of it on the floor or at the cat
6686480 agatha loves it there and she has a load of handbags and shoes she wants to give me
6686481 but then roger changed his mind and agreed with his wife about going to barbados
6686482 suddenly eliza changed her mind and decided that scandinavia was the better choice after all
6686483 but then they came across a manual which contained a highly workable system of laws which enabled them to keep using the fiction fix but only in ways that contributed to the overall good of society
6686484 it seems to me that what we have here is a plot device known as an epiphany
6686485 people of fictionsville it seems we have all been set up i have reason to suspect that we are not in fact writing our own story here but that there is an author that we have not been aware of before
6686486 our story has been brought to a point of crisis and here we are all in a scene where we are totally poised on the brink of an epiphany its a masterful stroke whoever this narrator is he or she has enabled us to come to this point by our own free will and yet is also making his or her design clear
6686487 but if there is a narrator who is narrating the things that we thought we decided to narrate
6686488 does that mean that we are not really fiction fixing anything ourselves but are just puppets in the hands of the larger narrator do we really have any say in the narrative of our lives
6686489 they create multifaceted contradictory complicated characters who dont really understand themselves
6686490 the best authors allow the story space to grow and to take on a life of its own and yet they offer guiding principles which allow the narrative coherence as well as unpredictability they love their characters and more than anything want them to develop a life of their own
6686491 call me radical but i suspect this fictionsville story would turn out a whole lot better if we stopped trying to fiction fix it and just trusted to the greater narrator
6686492 lets get rid of the pens stop trying to fiction fix things ourselves and well just go with the flow of the greater narrative
6686493 so were going to stop directing the course of our own narratives
6686494 im so tired of trying to see how i can turn making coffee into an exciting scene stealer now whos for a latte
6686495 what exactly is a latte again asked a particularly decrepit elder
6686496 and i dont need my fiction pen to do that
6686497 really small really quiet really cheap its a nice and all round rarity
6686498 its really really small of course its fanless so its really quiet its also good for professionals

6686510 were happy to talk to them about potential relationships with our sponsors but weve made it clear there cant be any exceptions to the salary cap rules
6686511 were just introducing him to our sponsors which is really the only measure we can do
6686512 sometimes there are sponsors willing to get on board with them but its very important that we dont make an exception to the rules
6686513 all three reports tend to indicate that were bottoming out but that there is no real end in sight and thats what i think the market has to get used to
6686514 we are the initiators of the fight against world jewry which now directs its hate its brutal greed and destructive will toward us we must win this battle for ourselves for europe for the world
6686515 as soon as we were made aware that the eternal jew was being advertised on sun local it was removed the sun is now looking at how automatic feeds into sun local and will work with our service provider oodle to ensure in the future only suitable content is presented under the sun brand
6686516 this is the most virulent nazi anti semitic propaganda film but cst is greatly heartened by the suns prompt actions in removing the film and appearing to implement policies to minimise the chances of any repetition
6686517 unfortunately the internet has seen this kind of filth becoming quite widely available in comparison to the 1980s and early 1990s when it was sold by semi underground po box based companies
6686518 we are pleased that the sun has reacted so quickly and properly but this remains a cautionary tale
6686519 the agreement will be temporarily frozen pending appropriate circumstances that allow for its implementation
6686520 you can do anything with bayonets except sit on them

6686522 he had good health all his life apart from anxiety attacks from 1990 onwards
6686523 he saw going to the doctor as a weakness and thought the anxiety attacks were something he should fight alone
6686524 i was surprised and concerned to hear of his death
6686525 i had come to know him well and considered him to be a friend i hope he has now found some peace
6686526 its been fun we learned a lot about how to get around school and open our lockers
6686527 this is something were using to ease the anxiety of coming into sixth grade
6686528 it can be hard coming from smaller schools and being mixed with kids from all these other schools
6686529 these kids are going to feel so far ahead when they show up for class next week
6686530 they know teachers theyve made new friends theyve learned to navigate the building
6686531 were calling them camp counselors and hoping theyll be able to ease the way for the other kids
6686532 this helps them get the sense that theyre not coming to some strange land
6686533 ive learned my way around and gotten to meet a lot of the kids
6686534 i think for the kids we saw a little hesitation at the start but now theyre really into it
6686535 i think theyll be much more prepared for school when we get started next week
6686536 wir spielen erstmals seit jahren wieder in der verbandsliga und der sprung von der landesliga dorthin ist richtig gro wir m ssen uns schnell mit dem tempo und der technik in dieser liga vertraut machen da sind viele teams schon einen schritt weiter

6686542 arming syria would lead to a strategic change and could destabilize the middle east and the world
6686543 we are indeed prepared to sell only defensive weapons which do not violate the regional balance of power
6686544 why in the world would we need to deploy our missiles in syria against whom we have no enemies in the region
6686545 we understand russias stance regarding the breakaway regions and understand that it came in retaliation to georgian provocation
6686546 jangan pernah sekalipun bicara cinta kepadaku sekarang ini khususnya dalam posisiku saat ini
6686547 petanyaannya klimaks dalam cerita di atas terdapat pada a awal cerita saat tokoh utama mulai terlibat masalah tengah cerita saat tokoh utama berkelahi dengan tokoh antagonis c tengah cerita saat tokoh utama berkelahi dengan tokoh protagonis d akhir cerita saat tokoh utama berhasil menyelesaikan masalah e akhir cerita saat tokoh antagonis berhasil membalas dendam kepada tokoh utama
6686548 ehm ada yang jawab e ada yang punya jawaban lain
6686549 jawabannya sudah jelas ya b klimaks itu kan artinya adegan puncak letaknya di tengah cerita
6686550 kalo menurut saya klimaksnya ini yang di akhir cerita saat tokoh utama ditusuk dengan pisau oleh tokoh antagonis kan pada saat itu justru menjadi saat yang mengejutkan
6686551 ho ho kamu berpikirnya terlalu jauh bukannya sudah diterangkan klimaks itu adegan puncak letaknya di tengah iya kan anak anak
6686552 klimaks pada cerita ini yaitu pada saat seru serunya mereka saling bekelahi itu adegan puncaknya
6686553 tapi pak adegan terakhir ini kan justru puncak permasalahannya si antagonis sudah sangat dendam kemudian dia menikam tokoh utama klimaks dari cerita ini adalah pelampiasan dendam itu pak
6686554 hamid sudah saya bilang kan kamu itu berpikir terlalu jauh nggak usah susah susah begitu
6686555 alur dalam cerita itu ada pengenalan cerita kemudian terjadi konflik di situ

6686600 russian peacekeeping soldiers in numbers required to ensure security will remain within the limits of the security zone at specially installed posts
6686601 in the phone call president bush said that the united states is looking for russian compliance with the agreement to withdraw their forces and an end to their siege of georgia
6686602 i cant imagine a circumstance right now that we would engage in military cooperation with the russians until the situation in georgia is resolved
6686603 its been quite disruptive to my study weve had constructive noise right through the year concrete drilling jack hammers weve had floors flooded its just been really bad for study as well as just living
6686604 were totally supportive of victoria university but were not supportive of unicomm and the way its been rundown over the past couple of years

6686615 its hard because you play for two or three days in training and then you have a match
6686616 it is difficult but the more we play together the better we will become
6686617 i dont know if i will stay in the team but we work on it especially now with the manager we seem to play together in training all the time which helps
6686618 i didnt hear that one thats flattering i wish i could get as many goals
6686619 it was very tough it was difficult last season but whatever doesnt kill you makes you stronger
6686620 you are playing against better players stronger players who are sharper and quicker and it makes you mentally and physically better
6686621 the most important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle
6686622 andys injury has improved immensely and hes quite close to full fitness clinically hes very close
6686623 due to the transfer taking a long time and everton not using him in pre season out of fear he might become injured he hasnt had much chance to get match fit
6686624 the chances are that we will use the three week period we have between arsenal and bolton to make sure we get him in tip top condition
6686625 im very concerned that the season has just begun and there are 38 matches to be played
6686626 its important for me to have andy up running and fit for most of those matches
6686627 i dont want to throw him in early because its the tempting thing to do
6686628 as often happens with these type of injuries the player gets back and theres a slight recurrence and he misses another couple of weeks
6686629 the season becomes very bitty and that would be a major error for the player and the club
6686630 im looking for another style of midfielder a more defensive one who is strong and tall
6686631 natives near natives or adopted san pedrans prefer the use of peedro it is an affectionate way of identifying ones residence or birthplace of course the proper pronunciation is sahn pehdro which any first year spanish student can attest i know many spanish speaking individuals who say peedro with no disrespect to the spanish language
6686632 like most boys i had them when i was younger
6686633 then when i had a boy of my own i started collecting with him

6686636 i think it brings back a lot of childhood memories a lot of the older cars ive bought were cars that i had when i was younger its something thats been with me forever
6686637 for instance we think of honda as a car company that does great sedans and small cars
6686638 but the car they created is a fire breathing v10 powered monster machine
6686639 we believe hanafi did this because he wanted her to give him all of her assets and a divorce outside of the courts so he would not have to pay her alimony or split their assets

6686663 the goal of our voyage is to break the illegal siege on the people of gaza as a step toward ending the israeli occupation of palestine
6686664 to remove any security pretence that israel may raise we have had our boats inspected and certified by cypriot authorities that they carry no arms or contraband of any kind
6686665 it has been 41 years since any boat has traveled in those waters and we plan to be the first
6686666 the seige that the israelis have imposed on gaza is not only illegal in terms of international law it is also immoral
6686667 global institutions and the governments of the world know what is happening and are not doing anything about it
6686668 provided documentation was in order they could sail thats the law and we cannot break it
6686669 there is this slow genocide going on in gaza and nobody is taking any notice

6686677 chris carney obviously thinks hes a washington big shot now first he abandoned his promise to represent pennsylvania values by voting with speaker of the house nancy pelosi and the liberals 90 percent of the time
6686678 now he refuses to even show enough respect for voters to defend his record in open and honest debates
6686679 carney is a sorry excuse for a congressman trying to win an election behind negative attacks instead of debates
6686680 it is reprehensible and completely beyond the pale that our opponent continues to personally attack congressman carney while he is

6686707 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6686708 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6686709 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6686710 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6686711 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6686712 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6686713 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6686714 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6686715 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6686716 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6686717 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6686718 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6686719 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6686720 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6686721 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6686722 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6686723 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6686724 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6686725 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6686726 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6686727 the hardest part was seeing all the speculation in the popular press about what the actual information was and most of it was wrong
6686728 and so it was hard to look at that stuff and say oh i know the answer here but i cant tell anybody
6686729 and in particular the fbi was really interested if they were weaponized or not
6686730 weaponized means the spores were specifically treated to make the spores float in the air easier so that it would be easier to breath
6686731 if we had seen weaponizing agents we would have seen some fuzz on the outside of these samples
6686732 it implies that it probably didnt come from a state sponsored terrorism and that this was more of a domestic source
6686733 i think we contributed a lot to their analysis of the anthrax attacks and so thats very gratifying

6686762 at amp t has long been a familiar face in the homes of americans first installing phone service high speed internet service and now at amp t u versesm tv
6686763 now we are taking that expertise to a whole new level with robust in home tech support and with the same great customer service and reliability weve delivered for more than a century
6686764 many of the bodies are so charred that identification will only be possible with the help of dna analysis
6686765 as democracy is perfected the office of president represents more and more closely the inner soul of the people on some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their hearts desire at last and the white house will be adorned by a downright moron
6686766 when fascism comes to america it will be wrapped in the flag carrying a cross
6686767 those who give up liberty for security deserve neither and will lose both
6686768 its important for our fellow citizens to understand when you think patriot act constitutional guarantees are in place when it comes to doing what is necessary to protect our homeland because we value the constitution
6686769 the power of the executive to cast a man into prison without formulating any charge known to the law and particularly to deny him the judgment of his peers is in the highest degree odious and is the foundation of all totalitarian government whether nazi or communist
6686770 to announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile it is morally treasonable to the american public
6686771 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6686772 this is a planning took where all things are going
6686773 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6686774 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6686775 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6686776 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6686777 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6686778 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6686779 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6686780 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6686781 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6686782 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6686783 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6686784 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6686785 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6686786 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6686787 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6686788 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6686789 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6686790 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6686791 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6686792 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6686793 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6686794 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6686795 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6686796 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6686797 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6686798 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6686799 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6686800 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6686801 le prime medaglie doro olimpiche vinte da atleti del nord testimoniano una superiorit etnica dei padani
6686802 le vittorie hanno certamente motivazioni di vario tipo nessuno per sembra avere il coraggio di dire la cosa pi ovvia ed evidente e cio che esse dimostrano la superiorit etnica dei padani anche in questo campo
6686803 parimenti legittimato a ignorare questa realt come stanno facendo i commentatori della rai
6686804 non si deve certo trarre da questa realt alcuna conseguenza di tipo razzista
6686805 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6686806 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6686807 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6686808 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6686809 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas

6686825 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools

6686827 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success

6686873 georgia needs army which will be ten times stronger compared to the current one
6686874 we managed to save the army which showed resistance to opponents superior forces within several days and made a retreat after our order
6686875 at the meeting we touched upon the issues to render humanitarian aid to georgia and military cooperation
6686876 we need to reinforce the defence army the senators who have visited georgia stated that their countries were ready to render georgia all the necessary defense resources

6686879 steel doesnt begin to melt until 2 700 degrees which is much hotter than what these fires could have caused
6686880 there are holes in this story that you can drive a truck through
6686881 we conducted the study without bias without interference from anyone
6686882 we have only one single minded goal in this effort
6686883 dr steven jones found it in the dust that landed in the entire area of lower manhattan and he finds it in the chunks of previously molten metal from the towers
6686884 if water had been available it is likely that sprinklers would have operated and the building may still be here today

6686891 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6686892 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6686893 expects russia to abide by its agreement to withdraw forces
6686894 our draft resolution is a reconfirmation of the six point agreement and theres no territorial integrity in the six principles
6686895 we believe the six principles are clear and already implemented
6686896 what we see on the ground is the result of ambiguity
6686897 we have a presence of so called russian peacekeeping forces at key georgian choke points that will control economic life it will control humanitarian activities thats why clarifications are so important
6686898 there is no bread there is no food no medicine people are dying
6686899 i cannot go on like this anymore i cry every day
6686900 its not they its we who will erase them from the face of earth
6686901 we want everyone to know the truth about the terrible events in tskhinvali with the hope that such a thing will never again happen on our land
6686902 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6686903 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6686904 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6686905 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6686906 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6686907 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6686908 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6686909 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6686910 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6686911 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6686912 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6686913 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6686914 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6686915 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6686916 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6686917 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6686918 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6686919 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6686920 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6686921 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6686922 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6686923 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6686924 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6686925 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6686926 a lack of vigor and if i may say a lack of commitment
6686927 within just a few minutes theres absolutely no risk to you so what are you waiting for order now rate it
6686928 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6686929 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6686930 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6686931 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest

6686938 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6686939 wir haben hinweise von den zust ndigen spanischen beh rden dass sich vier deutsche unter den todesopfern befinden
6686940 ich kann und will mir nicht vorstellen dass meine nachbarn tot sind
6686941 im fernsehen habe ich gestern das feuer gesehen glaubst du es tut weh wenn man verbrennt
6686942 das tut sicher so weh dass man ganz laut schreien muss
6686943 ich kenne die familie zwar nicht aber ich habe g nsehaut wenn ich mir vorstelle dass sie nicht mehr am leben sein k nnten
6686944 wir sind alle sehr betroffen von der meldung und beten dass das schlimmste nicht eintreten m ge

6686947 whats happening to me has made me love this place even more
6686948 its amazing to me all the people here have been so concerned and it really makes me want to stay here i just appreciate things even more
6686949 i just wanted to get out of police custody so i just said if you let me go no matter what the date i entered was ill leave on my own
6686950 i dont think i was breaking any law but i was really worried about pixie so i just wanted to be released from police custody
6686951 im just worried about the expense of crossing the border
6686952 i mean he lives day to day its a hardship
6686953 i just want him to be able to stay here and keep doing what he loves to do
6686954 it has been three years seven months and 21 days since that has been sitting there
6686955 the mayor would not live with this in her backyard premier rodney macdonald wouldnt live with it in his backyard so why should we
6686956 it should have been cleaned up and out of here long ago
6686957 they just keep pushing you around to someone else its like they dont want nothing to do with it
6686958 wed help over 100 people if we had the supplies
6686959 were just compiling a list of people who need that kind of help they appeal to us to try to find some way to help them

6686961 when ukraine prioritises its national interests it goes against russias interests and of course there will be conflict
6686962 and russia has broken through a psychological barrier to start this kind of war on former soviet territory georgia had created itself in the shape of an enemy of russia and many in russia already see us in the same way we probably rank third in the list of russias leading enemies
6686963 in that situation then russia will start playing games start provoking ukraine especially with crimea
6686964 when we think about our position on georgia i have no doubts the loss of sovereignty putting into doubt the territorial integrity of georgia this means revising the sovereignty of all
6686965 there is a reason to be wary in the short term future there is a threat in that ukraine is similar to georgia in terms of what has happened in recent years
6686966 but i find it difficult to think that the threat posed is a military one russia relies on the fact that it has more of an influence over ukraine economically
6686967 if ukraine sorts out its domestic situation and consolidates its foreign policy in terms of european and atlantic integration and this goes at a good pace then we can avoid the south ossetian scenario
6686968 according to the decision of the ioc lyudmila blonska has been removed from the start list for the womens long jump final
6686969 were still trying to determine if hes still in the area
6686970 we dont know if hes local or just passing through the area
6686971 i think after reading the presentence report its abundantly clear what you needed the money for
6686972 it felt like i was on fire from my wrist to my shoulder
6686973 they hold on to you and theyre so hard to brush off
6686974 this years reading festival has experienced some difficulty dealing with a significantly increased demand for tickets sold on the door at the festival site
6686975 festival republic and reading borough council are looking into the reasons for this increased demand which may be due to a number of factors including the ever growing popularity of the event and the growing knowledge that some tickets are available on the door
6686976 as in previous years a number of festival tickets including day and weekend passes were made available for purchase on the door on wednesday
6686977 festival republic took the decision at 6am to move people at the front of the queue off the public highway and on to a safer grassed area
6686978 seventy five or 80 per cent of the people will see a raise and theres also going to be a cost savings to the members on their health benefits
6686979 we wont have access to the content of e mails passwords or anything like that
6686980 if you try to make contact to a lot of addresses where there are no machines it indicates youre probing around the network because you dont know whats there
6686981 most people who contact a network legitimately know whats there and they go directly to the web server or mail server or some other well known service in the network
6686982 i could tell you that eastlink customers in general visit google im not sure thats a particularly sensitive piece of information
6686983 heres this very high level information and how do you determine based on that that heres a security event that isnt being picked up by anything else how do you begin to present that information
6686984 im one of those guys who bought a car then built a garage
6686985 we have the p e i mustang club and the quebec mustang club here and you get all the new cruisers here with their import cars which is great because theyre the next generation
6686986 were trying to piece together what happened but the good news story here was the fast response to get to the fire scene and that everyone is ok
6686987 arma ltd mr mbabazis company be advised to transfer their land for purposes of transaction with the fund
6686988 we solicited their feedback about what we could do over and above what were trained to do and the decision was shared with them before it was made pubic and the family clearly understands our reasoning
6686989 we have in the halifax regional municipality one of the highest calibre tap waters in the country if not in north america and we should celebrate that point
6686990 a lot of people like myself dont like diet pop and i shouldnt be drinking as much pop so i try and buy water i know there are concerns with that but sometimes theres no other option when you are trying to find something to drink
6686991 i dont believe there is a need to do so but that is up to each individual municipality
6686992 its because of the strong steps that weve made in that regard im able to say that
6686993 ive always thought its rather silly for people to be paying double for something that theyre already getting because they are already paying through their taxes for the municipal water systems
6686994 why buy bottled water when you can go to your tap theres some cases when perhaps you are going on a trip or you need the portability of it but most people dont and the tap water is well tested here in nova scotia as it is in most municipalities across canada
6686995 would like to see the united states provide assistance to the georgian military self defense equipment that will help them defend and deter against russian aggression in the future
6686996 we asked them what security needs they had and they were quite specific and quite defined
6686997 were not going to let this aggression stand the world is behind you
6686998 we cant let a bully do this because if they do it here theyll do it other places and if we dont stop it here well have to stop it in a much more difficult way
6686999 not going to prevent the american people from helping you
6687000 expects russia to abide by its agreement to withdraw forces
6687001 there is no bread there is no food no medicine people are dying
6687002 i cannot go on like this anymore i cry every day
6687003 moving around in the city and looking and searching in different places
6687004 we are waiting for the russians to respect their word
6687005 we waited twice with dashed hopes this time it appears that there is at least the beginning of a fulfillment
6687006 its not they its we who will erase them from the face of earth
6687007 we want everyone to know the truth about the terrible events in tskhinvali with the hope that such a thing will never again happen on our land
6687008 i hope that there are not people in russia who are hankering for the days of u s soviet confrontation because they are over
6687009 what the secretary general was referring to is fulminating about how youre going to attack poland because there are 10 interceptors aimed at long range threats of the future from countries like iran when youve been offered all kinds of measures to demonstrate
6687010 they russia must know that the united states would never permit an attack on the territory of an ally under article 5
6687011 what we have to prevent is the notion that we can draw a new line at ukraine and georgia
6687012 this was not so much about punishing russia the issue was helping georgia and making very clear to russia that if what was intended was to intimidate nato from deepening its relationships with ukraine and georgia they didnt do it
6687013 frankly the more the russians say things like well we are doing this as peacekeepers the more ridiculous that sounds
6687014 you know peacekeepers dont bomb civilian cities and tie up highways and prevent civilian ports from being used
6687015 according to this evenings information a supply ship will arrive tomorrow and on the 21st a second boat will come
6687016 its gonna be an awesome party with more than seven things i like
6687017 its gonna be totally awesome i hope its a great time i love roller coasters so this is my ultimate birthday
6687018 ill kill you then i can do whatever i want to you
6687019 i think her family is going to suffer from this
6687020 i am just devastated it was disgusting that they treated us like that there was no food no water no toilet and we were crammed in like animals
6687021 it was hard to breathe people were pushing and shoving and there was no one saying anything about what was going on
6687022 my friend collapsed and they told us if we left the queue we could not get back in so we had to leave
6687023 there was no food or water so i had to take some down to him
6687024 when i got there he was completely zoned out and couldnt really speak he had already been there on his feet for 12 hours at that time
6687025 i think it is atrocious that the organisers allowed that to happen steve has now got his ticket and he is happy but he said it was the worse day of his life
6687026 it was appalling there was no system people were pushing and shoving and because you were penned in a field rather than a queue some people from the back were pushing in front of people who had been there since 1am
6687027 i am never doing that again it was just dangerous
6687028 the stewards were teasing them eating burgers and chips and smirking as these thousands of kids were starving and thirsty i phoned the press office myself last night to complain and the woman told me they werent selling any more tickets
6687029 this was at 6pm and my daughter bought her ticket an hour later she didnt have a clue what was going on
6687030 my daughters friend collapsed and all the steward did was pull her out give her a bit of water and throw her back in again
6687031 all men are frauds the only difference between them is that some admit it i myself deny it

6687033 almost every one of them will transfer to somewhere else
6687034 the best available option for the department at this time is to close pontiac
6687035 pontiac and this state have had a wonderful partnership for more than 130 years
6687036 i look around and see everything that we do have
6687037 you know weve worked hard the last 20 years how would we ever start over
6687038 its nice and safe its quiet there at night its perfect were all like one big family especially on the first floor
6687039 our community is changing and thats not a bad thing
6687040 we want to make sure that all people have a decent place to live
6687041 this new facility will give vulnerable individuals an opportunity to build a stronger future for themselves
6687042 were one of many organizations wanting to provide housing for people who just cant participate in the economy

6687057 those first critical things that they do are very important to building this chain of survival
6687058 there could be terrible bleeding but you dont deal with the bleeding first you deal with the airway first then breathing then circulation
6687059 it means that the paramedics have to get in to kneel down to access the patient and touch them that means sometimes people have to move
6687060 the right kinds of things were done for this patient but hearing that can be upsetting for people

6687066 young women who have been exposed to a number of negative life events should be considered an at risk group for breast cancer and should be treated accordingly
6687067 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one severe and or mild to moderate life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women on the other hand a general feeling of happiness and optimism can play a protective role

6687070 jedoch ist es immer wieder schockierend dass solche aussagen f r die vp scheinbar keine konsequenzen nach sich ziehen sondern anscheinend goutiert werden
6687071 die vp zelebriert unter dem deckm ntelchen der modernit t eine r ckschrittliche frauen und familienpolitik das stellt sie nicht nur in fragen der kinderbetreuung unter beweis die nur bis mittags gratis angeboten werden soll sondern beispielsweise auch bei der forderung der vp frauen nach einem pensionssplitting hierbei werden frauen vom einkommen ihres mannes abh ngig gemacht so gesehen ist es nicht verwunderlich dass auch solch frauenfeindliche witze in vp kreisen wohlwollend akzeptiert werden und herr molterer sich gerne von gunnar prokop repr sentieren l sst
6687072 anticancer research is aimed at understanding the molecular pathways that can be selectively targeted to halt tumor growth
6687073 we know that the mtor pathway is activated in many cancers and therefore is a good target for fighting a wide array of tumors
6687074 we analyzed tissue from human biopsies as well as cancer cell lines and genetically engineered mouse models of cancer
6687075 this study inserts a new piece of information into the puzzle of the effects of mtorc1 inhibitors in cell signaling
6687076 furthermore because there are inhibitors of mapk pathway already approved for the treatment of cancer it provides us with the rationale for using combinations of mtorc1 and mapk inhibitors in attacking tumors thereby offering cancer patients another treatment option with immediate applicability

6687088 finding artifacts such as this one during experiments is not uncommon but we decided to investigate this one further since we kept observing it over and over when we sequenced it we were surprised to learn that we had found a new virus
6687089 in theory we could use this virus to produce a lethal toxin in the mosquito or instruct the mosquito to die after 10 days which is before it can transmit the malaria parasite to humans however these concepts are many years away

6687152 it will be natural to give some advice but i will not be focusing on that
6687153 the main thing is to be part of the team and perform well to show an example on and off the field
6687154 i would not have expected that but sir alex ferguson and i had a very good relationship that is why i stayed so long there because playing for him was a great honour
6687155 he listened to me and would not go against me so i am pleased

6687287 the court has no doubt that on the basis of that information the security service were right to conclude that bm was a person of great potential significance and a serious potential threat to the national security of the united kingdom

6687301 hes using the people of delaware and this senate career as a fallback to his aspirations to another career the situation is too critical for that
6687302 in this election i should be debating my real competition for this job odonnell said
6687303 and the people of delaware should get the opportunity to cast a vote for the person who is going to fulfill their term hes taken delawareans for granted and using the senate as a placeholder
6687304 whether people agree with my positions or not they should be outraged she said
6687305 this is precisely why our country and our state is in the situation it is
6687306 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
6687307 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells

6687309 we havent made wembley our home yet thats the biggest thing
6687310 it feels like when were going out there its tough
6687311 every game is tough these days but we need to make it daunting for players and teams coming to wembley
6687312 we will get there we will build on that but its about getting the confidence up which will happen in the qualifiers
6687313 the manager thrives on challenges he wants the best out of the team and hell get that
6687314 people expect change straight away and it just doesnt happen like that
6687315 merck lobbied every opinion leader womens group medical society politicians and went directly to the people it created a sense of panic that says you have to have this vaccine now
6687316 an obscure killer confined mostly to poor nations to the wests disease of the moment
6687317 suggest that cervical cancer incidence and mortality continue to decrease significantly overall
6687318 the overall effect of the vaccines on cervical cancer remains unknown
6687319 published reports of trials show an increasing trend of precancerous cervical lesions caused by hpv serotypes other than hpv 16 and hpv 18
6687320 how easy is it to do business with manchester united easy and we are very pleased to have got him
6687321 if you tell him he can go for that price and without any restrictions you cannot stop him
6687322 hes 31 for a striker thats quite a reasonable age but for a central defender hes still good
6687323 central defenders can play until 34 at the top level without any problems
6687324 jerusalem must remain the capital of israel and must remain undivided
6687325 it is one of those things ive been used to in the past
6687326 at a test level i look back at when i first had my debut run on in 2000 there was probably about four or five months between playing football
6687327 thats the nature of what weve got in australian rugby not much football between test and super 14 football
6687328 and again last year at the world cup there wasnt much football before then
6687329 it is something i have a lot of experience with so its not too much of a concern
6687330 i feel physically very good i have been training well and obviously been involved with the test team for the last eight or nine weeks
6687331 he probably wasnt that hopeful through super rugby that he was going to get any more international rugby
6687332 hes a really good team man and hes a bloke whos been around for a while
6687333 hes experienced and hes obviously really going to relish getting the opportunity to start a test match again and theres a window of opportunity for him and reserve brett sheehan now
6687334 i said earlier in the year i was surprised to be a part of the squad given the fact i am heading overseas my age and a lot of those factors
6687335 its been great to be involved again the opportunity has presented itself to start and thats a great feeling
6687336 probably some of that criticism was well justified years ago so were just working hard at the moment and over the last two years to rectify that
6687337 during the tri nations and i havent played a lot of it but our scrum has been going well not great but fairly well
6687338 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6687339 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6687340 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
6687341 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
6687342 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
6687343 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
6687344 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
6687345 auster moves from the personal to the political august brill a retired book critic and widower lies in bed recovering from a car accident and conjures an alternate reality in which al gore won the 2000 election and sept 11 and the iraq war never happened instead theres a civil war its an intriguing idea and the brooklyn resident who is also a screenwriter translator and occasional song lyricist will read from the work at politics amp prose on thursday express man in the dark
6687346 people got used to hearing something cool on a commercial and being like what band is this
6687347 if theyre out there really doing it if theyre playing at the echo then theyre not just being informed by how do i make this for a commercial theyre informed by their whole experience therefore you deliver something authentic
6687348 for a lot of people who have health insurance they are paying more for health care but it may not show up as concretely as paying 70 to fill their gas tank
6687349 college costs health care costs and energy costs are up and income is down
6687350 any one of those subjects touches a raw nerve for the middle class in this country im seeing it in race after race
6687351 the issue of health care may be getting less attention than it deserves from the media but its still a top concern for voters and among the top issues that sen obama talks about on the campaign trail
6687352 there is a stark contrast in the way both candidates would address the issue because the views on providing affordability accessibility and portability of health care are so divergent it could hardly escape the conversation each candidate will have with voters
6687353 if people had to pass that many signs that announced how much health care costs you can bet it would be at the top of the agenda
6687354 it is strikingly different from 2000 when gore spent 60 percent of the time at most events talking about health care
6687355 call last week for americans to break their addiction to oil
6687356 it honors the hard work of so many people who supported sen clinton
6687357 many of the pennsylvania delegates worked their heart out for sen clinton and theyre excited to cast a vote for her from my vantage point that will be closure for them
6687358 the government has taken tremendous liberties with our liberty taking away our liberty in the name of fighting terrorism using fear to take away peoples rights and their privacy in this country
6687359 and thats caused me and a lot of americans to lose a great deal of faith in the government which ought to be protecting our liberties not taking them away
6687360 they simply dont want the competition from an outsider so to speak somebody that might make them feel uncomfortable by raising some issues some new perspectives some new choices for the american people
6687361 youll get to see hillary speak on tuesday and barack obama the next president of the united states on thursday
6687362 and i hear hillary and you will have a chat ill make sure to stop by
6687363 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6687364 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6687365 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6687366 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6687367 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6687368 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6687369 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
6687370 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
6687371 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6687372 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6687373 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6687374 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
6687375 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
6687376 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
6687377 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
6687378 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
6687379 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
6687380 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
6687381 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
6687382 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6687383 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6687384 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
6687385 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
6687386 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6687387 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6687388 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
6687389 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
6687390 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
6687391 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
6687392 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
6687393 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
6687394 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
6687395 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
6687396 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
6687397 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
6687398 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
6687399 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
6687400 anders worden btw en ww het jaar erop alsnog bezien
6687401 besonders wichtig ist es uns einen dauerhaften ber die studienlaufzeit hinaus anhaltenden therapieerfolg zu erzielen
6687402 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
6687403 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
6687404 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
6687405 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
6687406 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6687407 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6687408 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
6687409 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
6687410 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
6687411 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
6687412 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
6687413 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
6687414 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
6687415 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
6687416 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6687417 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6687418 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6687419 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6687420 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
6687421 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
6687422 to resign on the day of the service for walter lippmann
6687423 he seemed perfectly decent and reasonable during the negotiations it has been a disquieting experience for me it has really made me lose my faith in my judgment of people
6687424 peretz used to look like a jewish psychoanalyst now he looks like a jewish used car salesman page 783
6687425 when i first heard that he was after the new republic i wrote gil saying that if he ever got hold of it he would destroy it
6687426 mutter von drei toten babys wegen totschlags ab dienstag vor zwickauer gericht
6687427 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6687428 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6687429 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6687430 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6687431 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6687432 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6687433 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6687434 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
6687435 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
6687436 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
6687437 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
6687438 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
6687439 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
6687440 when its hard living on a 500 per month fixed income hard to pay the light bill pay for natural gas go to town and buy gasoline thats when it hits home
6687441 we know that here in south carolina we have a disparity in health care
6687442 we have to bring in communities that will be more affected make them part of the decision making
6687443 why do you need us to join the climate debate are you saying because i am black i am not involved already or that you need more useful victims for your cause agenda
6687444 it becomes evident that while discussing climate we are not witnessing a clash of views about the environment but a clash of views about human freedom
6687445 as someone who lived under communism for most of my life i feel obliged to say that the biggest threat to freedom democracy the market economy and prosperity at the beginning of the 21st century is not communism or its various softer variants
6687446 why do so many people who subscribe to the belief in global warming also subscribe to the leftist liberal viewpoint on so many matters why does this belief appeal to those that have a certain political view
6687447 what does a cane toad and salt water intrusion have to do with global warming see you liberals just flip and spin flip and spin obama is an expert at it
6687448 it didnt take us long to figure out what this
6687449 if the lawyers will take the case sue the people who sell carbon credits that includes al gore that lawsuit would get so much publicity so much media attention and as the experts went to the witness stand and testified i feel like that could become the vehicle to finally put some light on the fraud of global warming
6687450 also i dont think that the republicans have handled the war on terror very well either
6687451 none of the studies cited above has shown clear evidence that we can attribute the observed climate changes to increases in greenhouse gases
6687452 no study to date has positively attributed all or part of the climate change to man made causes
6687453 how can you be so self centered how can you seriously type this nonsense
6687454 quit categorizing everyone who is not a conservative republican as an athiest who has no love and respect for this nation
6687455 how can you be so self centered how can you seriously type this nonsense
6687456 btw going from the frying pan to the fire is technically
6687457 bowing to pressure from environmental groups the florida senate recently passed a bill backed by gov charlie crist that would eventually shut down six pipes that carry waste water into the atlantic from miami dade broward and palm beach counties
6687458 people are getting smart on the bs behind mmgw and that is exactly why algore is trying to recruit
6687459 no trippin we just have to stop dumping raw feces and piss into the ocean simple
6687460 i didnt know what to expect some kind of moonscape perhaps but it was incredible huge matrices of branching porites coral up to 8 meters 25 feet high had established creating a thriving coral reef habitat
6687461 throughout other parts of the lagoon it was awesome to see coral cover as high as 80 percent and large tree like branching coral formations with trunks 30 centimeters 12 inches thick
6687462 it seems like you won approval from all who write bs on every subject every day the know it alls stay true to yourself never change to please others or to fit in

6687465 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
6687466 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
6687467 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
6687468 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
6687469 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
6687470 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
6687471 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
6687472 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
6687473 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6687474 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
6687475 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
6687476 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
6687477 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
6687478 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
6687479 oh weve got more important things we have to do
6687480 the claims about bullet voting in the dartmouth alumni election remind me that with a per voter average of voting for 1 8 candidates the proportion of bullet votes has to be fairly small the alternative as i mentioned in a communcation a day or two ago is that nearly everyone voted for one or three candidates but not two unlikely as that might be it would suggest that most of those who voted followed a strategy of either voting for the petition candidate or voting for all nominated candidates in which case richie s claim that the opposition was disorganized falls apart as does the claim by some of the alumni council people that in a 1 on 1 situation the petition candidate would been defeated
6687481 because approving a second choice may help defeat the voters first choice it is likely to devolve to typical vote for one plurality voting
6687482 die chinesische f hrung hat entgegen aller hoffnungen die olympische idee schamlos verraten entsetzt mussten wir mit ansehen wie w hrend der spiele alle internationalen standards der presse und meinungsfreiheit missachtet wurden
6687483 aber schlimmer als den aktivisten und journalisten von deren festnahme wir erfahren haben ergeht es den menschen in tibet deren schicksal weitgehend vor der welt verborgen wird dies waren wahre trauerspiele f r die freiheit
6687484 die welt darf deshalb auch nach den olympischen spielen die augen nicht verschlie en
6687485 barangsiapa sakit atau dalam perjalanan lalu dia berbuka maka wajib baginya berpuasa sebanyak hari yang ditinggalkannya itu pada hari hari yang lain alloh menghendaki kemudahan bagimu dan tidak menghendaki kesukaran bagimu
6687486 alloh taala menghendaki memberikan kemudahan kepada kalian untuk menempuh jalan jalan yang menyampaikan kepada keridhoan nya dengan semudah mungkin dan mempermudah jalan jalan itu dengan sepenuh kemudahan karena itulah semua perkara yang diperintahkan alloh kepada hamba nya pada asalnya merupakan sesuatu yang sangat mudah
6687487 islam dibangun di atas lima perkara persaksian bahwa tidak ada sesembahan yang haq kecuali alloh dan sesungguhnya muhammad adalah utusan alloh menegakkan sholat menunaikan zakat berhaji dan puasa romadhon
6687488 maka ketahuilah bahwa sesungguhnya tiada yang berhak disembah dengan benar kecuali alloh dan mintalah ampunan terhadap dosamu
6687489 al bukhori rohimahulloh berdalil dengan ayat ini untuk menunjukkan kewajiban memulai dengan ilmu sebelum berucap dan berbuat ini merupakan dalil atsari berdasarkan penukilan pent yang menunjukkan seorang insan mengetahui terlebih dahulu baru kemudian mengamalkan di sana juga terdapat dalil aqli nadhari berdasarkan pemikiran dan perenungan pent yang menunjukkan ilmu itu didahulukan sebelum ucapan dan amalan
6687490 segala sesuatu yang dicintai dan diridhoi alloh baik berupa perkataan maupun perbuatan yang nampak maupun yang tersembunyi
6687491 hai orang orang yang beriman diwajibkan atas kalian berpuasa sebagaimana diwajibkan atas orang orang sebelum kalian agar kalian bertakwa
6687492 telah diwajibkan kepada kalian berperang padahal itu kalian benci bisa jadi kalian membenci sesuatu padahal sebenarnya itu baik bagi kalian dan bisa jadi kalian menyukai sesuatu padahal sebenarnya itu buruk bagi kalian alloh lah yang lebih tahu dan kalian tidak mengetahui
6687493 dan sesungguhnya masjid masjid itu adalah milik alloh maka janganlah kamu menyeru disamping alloh sesuatupun
6687494 alloh taala melarang seorang insan menyeru beribadah disamping alloh sesuatupun dan alloh tidaklah melarang dari sesuatu kecuali karena dia yang maha suci lagi maha tinggi tidak meridhoinya
6687495 jika kamu kufur sesungguhnya alloh tidak membutuhkan kamu dan alloh tidak ridho kekafiran bagi hamba nya dan jika kamu bersyukur niscaya dia ridho kepadamu
6687496 sungguh telah diwahyukan kepadamu muhammad dan kepada orang orang sebelummu sungguh jika kamu berbuat syirik niscaya lenyaplah seluruh amalmu dan benar benar kamu akan termasuk golongan orang orang yang merugi
6687497 maka barangsiapa yang mengharapkan perjumpaan dengan robbnya maka hendaklah dia mengerjakan amal sholih dan tidak mempersekutukan sesuatu apapun dalam beribadah kepada robbnya
6687498 dan dua hal inilah rukun amalan yang diterima harus didasari keikhlashan kepada alloh serta showab benar yaitu sesuai dengan syariat rosululloh shollallohu alaihi wa sallam
6687499 alloh berfirman yang artinya aku adalah dzat yang tidak membutuhkan sekutu barangsiapa mengerjakan suatu amal yang dicampuri kesyirikan kepada ku maka aku tinggalkan dia beserta kesyirikannya itu
6687500 barangsiapa yang mengerjakan suatu amalan yang tidak ada tuntunannya dari kami maka tertolak
6687501 tujuan dari puasa bukanlah sekedar mengekang tubuh dalam rangka menahan haus dan lapar serta kesulitan akan tetapi tujuannya adalah menundukkan jiwa dengan meninggalkan sesuatu yang dicintai demi meraih keridhoan dzat yang dicintai adapun perkara dicintai yang ditinggalkan adalah makan minum dan jima inilah nafsu syahwat adapun sesuatu yang dicintai yang dicari keridhoan nya adalah alloh azza wa jalla maka kita harus senantiasa menghadirkan niat ini bahwasanya kita meninggalkan pembatal pembatal puasa ini demi mencari keridhoan alloh azza wa jalla
6687502 men det kan jag v l aldrig tro det ser ju inte ut att vara n t fel p dig
6687503 hikmah diwajibkannya puasa terhadap ummat ini telah diterangkan oleh alloh subhanahu wa taala dalam firman nya
6687504 barangsiapa yang tidak meninggalkan perkataan dusta berbuat dengannya dan juga tindakan bodoh maka alloh tidak membutuhkan perbuatannya meninggalkan makan dan minumnya
6687505 barangsiapa yang berpuasa romadhon karena iman dan ihtisab niscaya dosanya yang telah berlalu akan diampuni
6687506 shalat lima waktu yang satu dengan lainnya ibadah jumah menuju jumah yang lain ramadhan menuju ramadhan sesudahnya menjadi penghapus dosa dosa selama dosa dosa besar dijauhi
6687507 puasa adalah perisai apabila kamu sedang puasa janganlah berkata jorok janganlah berteriak teriak dan janganlah berbuat bodoh apabila ada seseorang yang mencacinya atau memeranginya maka katakanlah sesungguhnya aku sedang puasa sebanyak dua kali
6687508 puasa adalah perisai yang digunakan hamba untuk melindungi dirinya dari neraka
6687509 demi dzat yang jiwa muhammad berada di tangan nya sungguh bau mulut orang yang sedang puasa itu lebih harum di sisi alloh pada hari kiamat daripada bau minyak kasturi
6687510 harumnya bau mulut orang yang berpuasa di sisi alloh melebihi harumnya minyak kasturi karena ia timbul dari pengaruh puasa sehingga baunya harum di sisi alloh subahanahu dan dicintai nya ini adalah dalil yang menunjukkan agungnya kedudukan puasa di sisi alloh sampai sampai sesuatu yang tidak disenangi dan dirasa kotor di sisi manusia menjadi sesuatu yang dicintai di sisi alloh serta berbau harum karena ia muncul dari ketaatannya dengan menjalankan puasa
6687511 sesungguhnya di dalam surga terdapat sebuah pintu yang disebut ar royyaan pada hari kiamat orang orang yang berpuasa masuk melalui pintu itu tidak seorangpun yang masuk selain mereka apabila mereka telah masuk maka pintu itu ditutup dan tidak ada lagi orang yang masuk melewatinya
6687512 orang yang berpuasa memiliki dua kebahagiaan yang dia bergembira dengannya ketika berbuka dia bergembira dengan bukanya dan ketika berjumpa robbnya dia bergembira dengan puasanya
6687513 first we divide the amount of energy that the reactor produces 2 500 megawatts by the nameplate rating of the wind turbine which is 1
6687514 now let us look at the amount of land area that would be needed for these 6 668 wind turbines
6687515 to figure the spacing of the wind turbines let us multiply the rotor diameter of 77 meters by 3 which gives us 231 meters as the spacing between the wind turbines
6687516 if we multiply 231 by 385 it will give us the total area required to site one of our 1 5 mw wind turbines this comes out to 88 935 square meters or 22 acres of land for one 1 5 mw wind turbine if we now multiply the 22 acres by the 6 668 wind turbines we get 146 696 acres which is 229 21 square miles about three times the size of the metropolitan washington d c area so it appears that it will take 146 696 acres of land covered with wind turbines to have a part time generating capability equivalent to that achieved on 4 000 acres of land for the nuclear power plant which includes a lake used to provide water to the cooling towers
6687517 wind energy advocates purposely confuse the availability factor and the capacity factor in their promotional materials to try to demonstrate that a certain number of wind turbines can produce the same energy as a nuclear power plant in truth although the availability factor of the wind turbine is 100 because it is available to produce power at any time wind turbines actually produce power less than 25 of the time and that is only when the wind blows compare this to the nuclear power plant in which the availability factor and the capacity factor are the same about 95 the only time the nuclear reactor is not producing power is during maintenance periods
6687518 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
6687519 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
6687520 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
6687521 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
6687522 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
6687523 trust me i have the inside dope that obvious thing that everyone already knows is true
6687524 i cant believe i actually miss jonah goldberg in tnr
6687525 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6687526 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
6687527 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
6687528 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
6687529 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
6687530 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
6687531 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
6687532 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
6687533 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
6687534 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
6687535 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
6687536 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
6687537 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
6687538 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
6687539 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6687540 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
6687541 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
6687542 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
6687543 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
6687544 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
6687545 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
6687546 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6687547 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6687548 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
6687549 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
6687550 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
6687551 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
6687552 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
6687553 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
6687554 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
6687555 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
6687556 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
6687557 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
6687558 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
6687559 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
6687560 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6687561 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6687562 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6687563 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6687564 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6687565 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6687566 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
6687567 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
6687568 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
6687569 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
6687570 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
6687571 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
6687572 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure
6687573 hang on one goldurned minute this aint gold at all its just gold coloured
6687574 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
6687575 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
6687576 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
6687577 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
6687578 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
6687579 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
6687580 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
6687581 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
6687582 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
6687583 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
6687584 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
6687585 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
6687586 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night

6687588 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
6687589 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
6687590 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
6687591 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
6687592 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
6687593 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
6687594 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
6687595 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
6687596 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be

6687649 everybodys fit apart from jason price and darren byfield who are perhaps a game away from being in contention
6687650 jason price came back into training and as luck would have it has tweaked his medial ligament so he couldnt play on tuesday against chesterfield darren is only three weeks post surgery and we didnt want to push him hes looking sharp in training
6687651 hes got a problem with his back which is an ongoing problem it flares up every now and again it flared up just before the play off final and against derby and it did again after he linked up with the welsh team full credit to them they said that it was only a friendly and that although they could push him through but they said that at this stage in the season it would be silly so they released him and hes been under the care of john dickens since
6687652 how easy is it to do business with manchester united easy and we are very pleased to have got him
6687653 if you tell him he can go for that price and without any restrictions you cannot stop him
6687654 hes 31 for a striker thats quite a reasonable age but for a central defender hes still good

6687733 it is early in the season and we have to be positive and look at what is ahead of us we fully intend to have a successful season and we are working to that end we are establishing the direction in which we are going and making sure the team is nice and solid
6687734 it is a bit frenetic people see us as an easy target at the moment and they are jumping on anything they can find if they cant find it then they are making it up
6687735 our concentration as a football department is to win premier league games and that is what we intend to do
6687736 not too much should be read into last weeks game at villa because i thought we did well in the first half most sides will find it hard to go to villa park this season because of the personnel they have and the way they play we will not be the last team to struggle there

6687740 en la primera parte hab a que tener mucha sangre fr a porque te ves fuera de la prueba y luego me he juntado con el mexicano y he visto la opci n de irnos para delante pero ha ido muy r pido dos vueltas y lo ha pagado
6687741 no me lo han ense ado con lo cual no sabes si te van a ense ar otro si vas limpio y los de delante ven que les recortas pueden forzar y alguno puede quedar descalificado sa era la nica opci n porque he visto que el tercero era inalcanzable
6687742 soy un viejo que sabe mucho he hecho lo m ximo pero con estos j venes no ten a mucho m s que hacer son cuatro minutos de diferencia ese ritmo de inicio no lo hubiera aguantado ha sido una temporada que se ha complicado mucho con el problema en la cadera que se ha transmitido a la espalda y ahora he llegado muy justo ten a molestias las vacaciones las voy a pasar en la cl nica dexeus
6687743 va a hacer una transici n poco a poco hacia el 50 kil metros
6687744 y yo estoy convencido de que el a o que viene puede ser campe n del mundo en berl n en 20 kil metros jefersson p rez va a ir a madrid a un master en administraci n de empresas con lo cual tiene un rival menos
6687745 tiene todas las posibilidades de ser campe n del mundo porque tiene esa espina clavada y en londres puede perfectamente doblar las dos pruebas hacemos un buen equipo pero todos tenemos fecha de caducidad ahora los que han de subir son juanma y paquillo al 50 e ir haciendo hueco a los chavales j venes porque tenemos muy buena materia prima
6687746 a ver si no me descalifican porque llevo dos mundiales descalificado me quedo con el sabor agridulce de no haber conseguido una medalla ol mpica pero he hecho todo lo posible por conseguirla en atenas la tuve cerca y no la pude lograr si los jueces me ven as tan sancionable dif cilmente voy a ir a m s
6687747 given the significant rally in the u s dollar that has taken place over the last two and a half weeks i think the market has gotten a little bit over extended here and weve entered into a bit of a corrective phase
6687748 for the most part the main catalyst still comes back to price action in the commodity markets and with a substantial spike higher in oil today were seeing not only the u s dollar weaken off against the major currencies but thats been a benefit for the canadian dollar given the positive correlation between crude and the loonie
6687749 i think oil prices are finding some sort of base
6687750 and we do have some issues going on now the u s dollar declining again on the back of mortgage financiers freddie mac and fannie mae and this potential bailout
6687751 youre going to have everyone fearful of the unknown and fearful of bigger writedowns until we see some concrete evidence that the writedowns are slowing and some evidence that u s house price declines are slowing
6687752 the commitment is there and continues to be there and nova scotians are going to get the benefit
6687753 they encana are working now to look at what can should be or will be substituted but make no mistake there will be a substitute for that
6687754 we expect the government to ensure that the people of our industry who will be most directly impacted by the decision on replacement activity will have a substitution project that is suitable enough to enable them to continue plying their trade
6687755 the question is what other better ways could businesses use this money
6687756 undoubtedly theyd rather be pumping this money back into their business
6687757 on accountants tax advisers and employee time just making sure the business is complying with the tax system and thats on top of the taxes remitted
6687758 now that the cost of tax compliance has been quantified the problem needs to be addressed
6687759 it is a significant component of taxation that governments at all levels must factor into their policies for the purpose of developing simpler tax systems
6687760 this all just started as a side project to make use of the land
6687761 the soil is really rich from being pasture for so many years
6687762 what i found out was that they always need hops and theyre interested in a local good quality supply
6687763 before that id only ever seen my own hops growing
6687764 so it was great to see these huge fourth generation farms
6687765 au fost telefoane nu doar de la bucuresti dar si din capitale mai indepartate
6687766 moscova astepta demult un pretext pentru a intra cu trupe in osetia de sud si saakasvili i a dat acest pretext
6687767 while headline inflation picked up on the month this mornings report shows little evidence of these higher prices filtering through to core inflation
6687768 looking ahead it appears as though the worst may be behind us
6687769 while headline inflation is now running at its fastest pace in more than five years it is still near the bottom of the pack globally and more than two points below the current u s pace
6687770 look for the headline readings to hang around three per cent for some time yet while core looks poised to grind higher as the loonie at par discounts begin to fade out of the calculation later this year
6687771 whether inflation is or isnt a problem in canada depends on which number you look to for an answer
6687772 if you dont drive dont have a mortgage payment and dont eat fresh produce youre in luck conveniently the bank of canada strips out many of the fastest rising categories from its core cpi measure but the typical canadian has all of those costs
6687773 for those of us who dont believe that oil grain and import prices are down for the count inflation is still a looming threat
6687774 its hard to get too excited about the prospect that the bank of canada will ease the policy rate any time soon
6687775 we did know that number would rise and we very consciously made this announcement while it was on the rise to tell people in advance
6687776 they feel like theyre making good progress they dont have a hard timeline to share on when that will be complete but its important to bring it back up to operations as safely and quickly as we can
6687777 we were able to get through last weekend with some temporary runouts weve decided that were better off to temporarily close a small number of stations
6687778 its great if youre a refinery because it blocks competition and helps you keep our prices up
6687779 but its not good for consumers and at times like this its not good for our operations either because we cant get any gas
6687780 the thunder and the kickstart are going to be a couple of devices that rim comes out with later this year that will probably look to compete more directly i think with the iphone and phones like that
6687781 yes its gorgeous and yes it has all of the great blackberry attributes but its very squarely aimed at enterprise given the price point
6687782 not only does it mean more jobs but it means we will be moving to new offices
6687783 we dont want our staff working late into the night we are very serious about life work balance by taking advantage of the time zone here we can still provide our customers with service up to 10 p m and all our employees can still be with their family in the evening
6687784 as long as we can help them they dont care where we are

6687789 how easy is it to do business with manchester united easy and we are very pleased to have got him
6687790 if you tell him he can go for that price and without any restrictions you cannot stop him
6687791 hes 31 for a striker thats quite a reasonable age but for a central defender hes still good
6687792 central defenders can play until 34 at the top level without any problems

6687795 my god hobarts even got the railroad on its side
6687796 a lot of people dont understand what just happened in the darkroom best to keep it to ourselves
6687797 his character has consistently declared itself from 1970 up until the last offence of 2002 to be deliberate persistent planned and premeditated behaviour
6687798 the offender over many years has displayed a deviate sexual interest in under aged boys and has failed to acknowledge it
6687799 my suggestion is that all obstetric units across this country remove t3s tylenol 3 from their obstetric formulary
6687800 ive actually contacted the hospital leadership at bc womens hospital asking that it be yanked completely so we no longer have it available
6687801 we dont want to panic people here theres kind of a warning bell going out there but we need a lot more studies to see it
6687802 the general advice is to take the smallest dose possible
6687803 the safety of patients who use our products is a priority for the company
6687804 tylenol 3 prescription tylenol with codeine is a safe and effective product when used according to the approved prescribing information
6687805 this recent revelation about codeine is of concern because codeine has always been pretty much treated rather casually
6687806 probably the best advice to people is to be very cautious about using compounds that contain codeine
6687807 in my own practice if someone needs codeine i think hard about it and make sure there is no other cause for that amount of pain
6687808 in my own clinical experience they new mothers can manage without it
6687809 the judge is really saying he wants to move this case along and im with him on that
6687810 we need a thorough investigation to present all evidence that should be presented at the sentencing hearing
6687811 hes not one of them he never was one of them
6687812 in my view hes never been accepted by the horsey set
6687813 he was absolutely suicidal we were so scared we were losing him
6687814 we want it known that we disagree strongly disagree with the selection we want the public the media and our sponsors to know weve done all we could to not accept him
6687815 i worked from the bottom up as a groom it was a lot of years of hard work thats where the tears on the medal podium come from
6687816 hes turned his life around and no one knows how
6687817 but the sports establishment came down so hard on him its great to sit in judgment
6687818 im so impressed with his character his strength and his discipline
6687819 he stops and says you know i really want to win for canada i want to win for my country erics a proud guy he was just driven by this
6687820 who showed me great support at a time when that was not so easy
6687821 wed cut down the ragweed and throw them like spears
6687822 hobart was a republican town the people didnt like fdrs works progress administration that was roosevelt it wasnt discussed too much
6687823 all my life i want to be a brickie work work work
6687824 i always thought i was lucky playing on that brand new field
6687825 russ was tough and he demanded everything out of you
6687826 a lot of people hated him when they played for him but when you got older you understood what he did and why he did it
6687827 we all loved playing in the bowl it was our home and we wanted to defend it all the players we looked up to as kids played there and when it was our turn to play there we knew it was special
6687828 my god hobarts even got the railroad on its side
6687829 the penn game really started it all what we did was special i dont know if anything like that can ever happen again
6687830 it was the toughest place to play in the region probably in the state if indiana
6687831 the fans were on you the players would be scared no matter how hard you tried to get them to just play
6687832 theyd look across the field and see that giant of a man howell and he was intimidating the brickie bowl was the same way
6687833 i dont know if i can watch hobart play home games in any place other than the bowl
6687834 at my age its a good day when i wake up
6687835 i dont get to as many games as i used to but id like to get to a few games this year it brings back a lot of memories and all of them are pretty special
6687836 we dont know why the chinese government has blocked itunes but it seems the most logical explanation is that it is because of us
6687837 i think ill have my staff get to you its condominiums where ill have them get to you
6687838 its seven seven houses and heres one house americans cant afford john mccain to move into

6687840 another boob job wont help cutting away scar tissue from previous boob jobs will only make their appearance worse long term
6687841 childrens rejection of unpalatable medications and bitter tasting foods is a complex product of maturing sensory systems genetic variation experiences and culture
6687842 the number one reason for non compliance among children when taking medicine or eating vegetables is that they dont like the taste
6687843 just look at a childs face when theyre eating some of these things
6687844 we find that the more a mother eats fruits when shes pregnant the more a child will accept fruits and vegetables
6687845 it would be no secret that we would like to see more conditionalities around the agreement
6687846 facilitated interviews by or on behalf of the united states when bm was being detained by the united states incommunicado and without access to a lawyer in pakistan in the period april 2002 until at least 17 may 2002 when he was seen by an officer of the security service
6687847 that mi5 continued to facilitate the interviewing of bm by providing information and questions after 17 may 2002 in the knowledge of what was reported to them as to the circumstances of his detention and treatment in pakistan
6687848 by seeking to interview bm in the circumstances found in pakistan and supplying information and questions for his interviews the relationship between the united kingdom and the united states authorities was far beyond that of a bystander or witness to the alleged wrongdoing
6687849 the court has no doubt that on the basis of that information the security service were right to conclude that bm was a person of great potential significance and a serious potential threat to the national security of the united kingdom
6687850 there is no reason to think these face transplants would not be as common as kidney or liver transplants one day
6687851 having the inside of the mouth of someone else it didnt belong to me it was atrocious
6687852 its a serious situation his dad has gone out there because everyone is so worried about his mental state the feeling is he cannot be left on his own a friend said
6687853 eww thats nasty i have never ever hooked up with michael phelps
6687854 come on i have really good taste hes really not my type we dont even talk to each other
6687855 im not dating amanda beard i think she has a boyfriend
6687856 part of my life is kept to myself im able to relax and be with my friends those pretty much are the only people who really know the answer to that

6687860 the ganglion is the only smell sub system thats completely functional at birth so we were thinking it was important for nipple finding for the baby mouse
6687861 the normal mouse immediately gets scared and goes to the corner of the box and freezes
6687862 the chemical sensors nose tip location is ideal for early detection of pheromones
6687863 first of all it extends a growing appreciation that the olfactory system is not a singular system but is really made up of several subsystems
6687864 ab 2279 is not about being under the influence while at work thats against the law and will remain so
6687865 its about allowing patients who are able to work safely and who use their doctor recommended medication in the privacy of their own home not to be arbitrarily fired from their jobs the voters who supported proposition 215 did not intend for medical marijuana patients to be forced into unemployment in order to benefit from their medicine
6687866 the legislature was right to approve banning employment discrimination of medical marijuana patients marijuana is safer than many prescription drugs that workers are allowed to use and urine testing has never been fda tested as either safe or effective in improving workplace safety and productivity
6687867 blur the distinctions between writer and subject fiction and nonfiction
6687868 are you kidding what are you talking about youre just a person like i am you are clueless you have no idea what happens

6687873 the groups profit performance in the first half of the year was strong despite the general economic tightening in the united states and western europe
6687874 the prospects for 2009 remain less certain particularly if the us and western european economies continue to be impacted by the financial crisis
6687875 zardari feels that you have been misinformed and that the case that you are referring to is closed please be careful about reporting something that may have been planted
6687876 these numbers will assist us as we head into the recovery phase of our operations
6687877 we want to ensure that we get an accurate assessment of the damages that have occurred so our residents can receive the assistance they need to recover
6687878 nearly all of our 67 counties will have been impacted by the time fay leaves our state and these funds will help our local and state partners recoup the costs of keeping floridians safe
6687879 the expectation is fay will continue to spread this 8 to 15 inches of rainfall along all of the interstate 10 corridor
6687880 its moving at a very slow rate of speed and that slow rate of speed is going to continue right through the weekend
6687881 were not going to focus much on the wind as it moves through north florida
6687882 theres a lot of people who didnt have insurance so they just didnt want to go
6687883 we may have started on two different paths but we are on one journey now
6687884 anyone who supported me has much more in common with sen obama than with sen mccain
6687885 we need every democrat to rally around senator obamas candidacy
6687886 this is his decision he gets to choose who he wants
6687887 hes ok but i still want to see how the candidates are going to improve the economy and offer something that i can believe will actually happen and im not sure what that is
6687888 and now im asking that you work just as hard for senator obama
6687889 it took me a while to let things go you just have to work through that stuff it takes a few years divorce is really awful a lot of people go through that more than once and i dont know how they do it i mean once was enough for me
6687890 were in this time when you have to be young and pretty weve gone back to that
6687891 there were a lot of people 10 or 15 years ago who were putting on funny clothes and playing some kind of country music who were dabbling
6687892 blue mountain was really authentic they were blending country blues and rock in an interesting way that only two or three bands were doing
6687893 it was one of the most happening places culturally in the country
6687894 fat possum records was based there so you had r l burnside and junior kimbrough and all those guys and oxford had this literary scene with larry brown and barry hannah there was a lot going on and we were kind of musically in the center of it
6687895 theres probably going to be periods of time where im probably not going to be making enough money from music and ill have to get an additional job
6687896 i mean thats how things have changed before we sold enough records and we made enough money on the road where we could really not worry about that for a while live show attendance has been up and down for everybody not just for us weve been lucky because we still have the markets where we did really well and were still doing really well but that could go away too
6687897 i have to say the one thing im glad to see is were also picking up some younger fans people who have heard of the band but never seen us or heard about us from their older brothers and sisters because if we were just playing to our old fans those people are like in the 30s and 40s now so theyve got kids you know theyre not packing the clubs anymore
6687898 i think its going to be fun and it really really feels good to be doing it again
6687899 frank and laurie are great friends one of the things that i thought about it was it was kind of unfinished business we kind of went out with a sigh more than a bang we want to come back and write another chapter
6687900 theres been quite a deal of lift in the resources stocks in particular
6687901 that strength in the equities market has translated into bond yields picking up
6687902 part of that is the reaction to the main trend in bond yields coming down
6687903 this is a subset of a larger inferred resource containing 97 million tonnes
6687904 the cost of production is expected to be in the lowest quartile of cash costs worldwide
6687905 defining a reserve from surface drilling is currently cost prohibitive and an exploration shaft with 2 5 kilometres of lateral development will be required to bring the project to a bankable status
6687906 this is great news at the worst possible time given the state of the zinc price which has not been this low since 2005
6687907 nickel miner panoramic resources which used to be sally mallay mining has gained about 15 per cent in the past two days on the back of nickel prices coming back
6687908 i am delighted that this important milestone has been reached

6687911 we believe significant progress has been made in the investigation
6687912 weve worked aggressively on this it appears to be isolated incident we expect this will be resolved quickly and when it does the information will be made public
6687913 frankly if i had perfect foresight i would never have taken this job in the first place
6687914 there is no reason to think these face transplants would not be as common as kidney or liver transplants one day
6687915 there are concerns the us treasury may be forced to intervene to prop up the companies
6687916 we saw some renewed concerns about the us banking sector
6687917 they just want to have a position adjustment so theyre buying back the aussie and the kiwi and their recent falls
6687918 uncertainty about the us financial sector has brought the focus back onto the troubles in the u s economy said jonathan cavenagh currency strategist at westpac
6687919 while growth in australia is easing the banking sector here is still well capitalised we think the aussie could rise a bit further
6687920 there are concerns the us treasury may be forced to intervene to prop up the companies mr lee said from singapore

6687922 out of respect for the older people you should go through a proper process of funeral and burial and that includes a mortuary that works
6687923 the study suggests that the critical ingredient in smoking that may be causing emphysema is cadmium a well known contaminant of cigarette smoke
6687924 the worry is if you are exposed to this cadmium through other sources you can also be at risk for emphysema
6687925 the most activity we see is in august and september
6687926 human cases as we see them may not be the complete picture
6687927 unser training war so geheim dass wir manchmal selbst nicht zuschauen durften
6687928 die verb nde sollten bedenken dass die vereine die spielergeh lter bezahlen
6687929 ich bin froh dass ab kommender saison die freitagsspiele in l nderspielwochen wegfallen
6687930 es ist schwierig das training auf die optimale formation und die beseitigung von fehlern abzustimmen wenn sechs akteure fehlen
6687931 das ist zu riskant ich kann schlie lich nicht f nfmal wechseln
6687932 klar w re es besser wenn wir mit dem vollen kader trainieren k nnten aber l nderspielreisen treffen die gesamte bundesliga da sind wir nicht allein
6687933 es ist einfacher tore zu schie en als den deutschen f hrerschein zu machen
6687934 zudem w rde die attraktivit t von investitionen im immobilienbereich gemindert wenn das beispiel bundesweit schule macht und es gelingt f r die nach dem deutschen mietrecht ohnehin schwierigen mieterh hungen weitere h rden aufzubauen
6687935 gelingt es den mietspiegel zu manipulieren wird er faktisch wertlos
6687936 ein qualifizierter mietspiegel wie er in berlin vorliegt dient nicht nur dazu mieterh hungen zu begr nden sondern mieter k nnen damit im zweifelsfall auch beweisen dass ihr vermieter zu viel verlangt
6687937 missbraucht die politik ihn um die mietentwicklungen zu beeinflussen besteht aber die gefahr dass er auf dem markt und vor gericht nicht mehr als vergleichsmittel anerkannt wird
6687938 ein solcher qualifizierter mietspiegel bildet vor allen anderen methoden zur ermittlung der mieth he wie vergleichswohnungen gutachten oder mietdatenbanken die entscheidende basis f r die begr ndung oder ablehnung von mieterh hungen
6687939 der mietspiegel ist keine stellschraube an der es sich nach belieben drehen l sst er soll mietentwicklungen realistisch abbilden und somit verwertbare marktinformationen liefern
6687940 willk rliche mieterh hungen sind unm glich und der anstieg der kaltmieten liegt seit jahren erheblich unterhalb der inflationsrate in einigen st dten besteht bereits ein deutlicher wohnungsmangel der nur dann abgebaut werden kann wenn sich investitionen im wohnungsbereich wirtschaftlich lohnen
6687941 bahwa tujuan salat adalah mengingat allah maka jika sudah ingat allah berarti tujuan sudah tercapai dan tidak perlu salat lagi tafsir semacam ini tentu saja tafsir yang salah
6687942 karenanya wajar jika muncul asumsi bahwa pembukuan quran hanya siasat bangsa quraisy melalui usman untuk mempertahankan hegemoninya atas masyarakat arab dan islam hegemoni itu tampak jelas terpusat pada ranah kekuasaan agama dan budaya dan hanya orang yang mensakralkan quranlah yang berhasil terperangkap siasat bangsa quraisy tersebut
6687943 satu dari tiga miuslimah dunia yang menciptakan perubahan positif dalam islam
6687944 pokoknya membaca promosi di sampulnya sepertinya buku ini sangat hebat
6687945 apa karena manji sangat liberal dan secara terbuka menyatakan diri sebagai lesbi maka sosok ini dijadikan idola
6687946 sebagai seorang pedagang buta huruf muhammad bergantung pada para pencatat untuk mencatat kata kata yang didengarnya dari allah
6687947 itu kemudian diangkat juga oleh salman rushdie menjadi judul novelnya the satanic verses ayat ayat setan novel yang terbit pertama tahun 1988 ini memang sangat biadab dalam menghina nabi muhammad saw para sahabat dan istri istri beliau menurut armstrong cerita dalam novel salman rushdi ini mengulang semua mitos barat tentang nabi muhammad saw sebagai sosok penipu ambisius yang menggunakan wahyu wahyunya untuk mendapatkan sebanyak banyak perempuan yang dia inginkan para sahabat nabi juga digambarkan dalam novel ini sebagai manusia manusia tidak berguna dan tidak manusiawi tentu saja judul novel itu sendiri sudah bertendensi melecehkan al quran it repeats all the old western myths about the prophet and makes him out to be an impostor with purely political ambitions a lecher who used his revelations as a lisence to take as many women as he wanted and indicates that his first companions were worthless inhuman people
6687948 apa yang dikatakan salman rushdie padaku ketika aku mulai menulis buku ini teringat lagi saat aku berefleksi terhadap hidupku sejak penerbitan buku ini
6687949 die syro aramaeische lesart des koran ein beitrag zur entschluesselung der koransprache
6687950 jika al quran dipengaruhi budaya yahudi kristen yang sejalan dengan klaim bahwa al quran meneruskan wahyu wahyu sebelumnya maka bahasa aramaik mungkin telah diterjemahkan oleh manusia ke dalam bahasa arab atau salah diterjemahkan dalam kasus hur dan tak ada yang tahu berapa banyak lagi kata yang diterjemahkan secara kurang tepat bagaimana jika semua ayat salah dipahami

6688073 its not easy this woman just called me and said she has a reservation of 9 seats and she is coming now but we do not have her records at all were already very full but ill see how i can accomodate her
6688074 i am a devoted admirer of your exquisite dancing i must know how you go about it when you dance is it that you lift your left leg number 28 and then your right leg number 39 or do you begin by lifting your right leg number 17 before you lift your left leg number 44 i await your answer in breathless anticipation yours truly tortoise
6688075 when i dance i do not think about steps when i think i am just a ghost im not dancing
6688076 i am going to host a chinese new years party at home and i propose a 10 dish chinese culinary spread i would be inviting 15 guests javier andrea marite rosana etc
6688077 and the dishes i would prepare are jiao zi steamed prawn dumplings hainanese chicken rice ma po dou fu beancurd with spicy meat sauce stir fried beef with celery nian gao sticy new year cake etc etc
6688078 yup this chinese new year would be the time where i return the hospitality to all my argentine friends and also cook for them some real chinese food not the lousy ones they get from the chinese restaurants here hehehe and royce i would like you to help me cook
6688079 one myself plus royce two plus maxima as a helper heh heh heh
6688080 how big is your kitchen how many pots and pans for cooking do you have
6688081 i think you should consider that you have only one or two afternoons to prepare your meals the size of your kitchen and the cooking tools available to you and most importantly you cooking experience and manpower available a 10 dish spread is impossible
6688082 isaac what is important in such a gathering is that all your friends enjoy your presence much more important than proving you are a good cook
6688083 oh thank you i followed well but i didnt dance

6688086 the hardest question i had to answer in my teaching career
6688087 gustavo asked me a question that was the hardest question i had to answer in my teaching career
6688088 gustavo asked now that we know the steps and all we know how to lead and follow comfortably and dance muscially what is it that we orientals still lack
6688089 i thought long and answered you orientals look to suffer too much in the dance
6688090 actually not just you guys but everywhere else in the world so they are trapped and they cant enjoy the dance when they dance they are not free
6688091 but the argentines when they dance they look for happiness in the dance they look to enjoy when they are dancing
6688092 your everyday argentine on the street theyre not rich they lead a hard life so its only during the time dancing they can forget about their daily harshness and be free and happy
6688093 when they embrace man or woman regardless they dont tear their hair out trying to obsess in technicalities posture figures or the teachings of tango teachers
6688094 instead they indulge in the shared embrace listen to the music to the singing let the body move naturally and have fun be happy together they just want to enjoy the music enjoy the partner and dance
6688095 why agonize over a perfect side step or a perfectly led giro as long as you dont throw each other off balance and two of you get from point a to point b together let whatever happen in between happen
6688096 so the bottomline is you guys are not free when you dance trapped in the little boxes you drew up to help you learn tango unable to be happy the argentines on the other hand do not have these boxes they refuse to let this dance of theirs be tainted with obsession over technicalities to them its still a dance where they can forget and be free
6688097 kalau kalian perhatikan di halaman depan ini terdapat penjelasan dilarang memfotokopi dilarang memperbanyak dilarang dilarang dan seterusnya sebenarnya ini wajar tetapi tidak sepenuhnya
6688098 kalau saya paksakan semua mahasiswa harus beli textbook asli maka cuma ada satu dua mahasiswa yang punya ingin beli pun belum tentu bisa sebab yang jual cuma sedikit itu pun belum tentu harganya terjangkau untuk kantong semua orang
6688099 ya saya bukannya ingin mengajar kalian agar mengabaikan hak orang lain mengarang
6688100 jadi saran saya kalian carilah fotokopian yang sudah dibuat oleh orang lain jangan menambah dosa
6688101 menyuruh anda fotokopi itu kan dosa tapi kalau saya suruh anda cari fotokopian yang sudah ada yah dosanya kira kira 1 x lah
6688102 kalau terpaksa harus fotokopi juga ya sudah apa boleh buat anda memang tak punya pilihan lain
6688103 intinya saya tak keberatan kalau anda mau fotokopi hanya saja ingatlah ini di masa depan kelak

6688106 there was this young guy i named him xiao huai dan little bad egg he keeps touching me during massages and he would pull up the covering towel to show his thing
6688107 some customers would ask for your phone number or touch here and there just say sir im sorry but we only do massages here if there are anymore problems just stop the massage and let me know
6688108 sure boss ill also like you to know i have a girlfriend girl
6688109 ya lah not all my massuers are gay but most of the clients are
6688110 your massage feels so good that i have to stop now if not i would want another one hour why not you just come and sit down beside me and talk to me for the last 10 mins
6688111 basically you need to learn other massages and also some techniques in facial and body scrub but i am running a one man show and i need someones help if you are still interested after you come back from argentina let me know
6688112 lets write down our wishes on the globo before we send it up to the heavens
6688113 look at your surroundings the long table opposite where you are sitting sits ernesto balmaceda and his partner stella baez with them a crowd of their young students and friends on the table to their left sits diego lanau and negracha with a couple of their friends and students on the table to your left sits giovanna de vincenzo who dances with aoniken quiroga the table in front of them sits el flaco dany tonight 70 of the dancers present are professional bailarinas dancers so which one are you
6688114 to dance well doesnt equal to knowing how to dance socially
6688115 judging from the size of the steps and the complexity of the figures do you always need a lot of space to dance pugliese
6688116 in salon social tango the energy of the steps and figures are usually projected near the embrace and embellishments usually happen at the ankle level because other people are dancing around you in fantasy stage tango where the couple is performing alone on stage the energy is projected more outwards further away from the embrace the embellishments happen much higher knee level and above
6688117 while the epitome of salon tango is the orchestra of carlos di sarli the epitome of fantasy tango is the orchestra of osvaldo pugliese
6688118 of course we dance puglieses music in a social milonga but as we are compelled to be more expressive in his music it is hard to dance pugliese when the dancefloor is very crowded it would be ideal if the dancefloor has more space
6688119 of course try not to slit anyones throat on the social dancefloor with your heels when you are dancing pugliese
6688120 to me dancing pugliese is like telling a story there is a beginning a middle part and a conclusion
6688121 and in the story there are sometimes very sweet parts sometimes very intense and brutal parts
6688122 some parts of the music for example when the bandoneon and piano drives the beat it calls for you to just walk forward like an elephant
6688123 some parts of the music calls for slow stretched out movements like chewing gum
6688124 and there are even some parts of the music for example during a long drawn out violin it calls for the men to just pause be still and silent to let the women express herself individually and fully
6688125 there is the end part the conclusion to the story which is called the variation or climax where the whole orchestra plays to a rousing finish and this is the part of the dance which is the most energetic and intense
6688126 now i can end my dancing night go back and sleep soundly

6688137 your name is isaac few years back javier brought home some chinitos for christmas too
6688138 oh well ill let you guys play ill be off to prepare my dishes for tonight
6688139 we used to be able to set our dining table on the street outside our house with other families and the whole neighbourhood would eat outside their houses so every family can see one another and eat side by side times have changed
6688140 but singapore banned it a few years ago as some houses got burnt or people got injured by the explosives
6688141 yeah it happens here too every year during christmas and new years you have numerous accidents like this in argentina
6688142 maybe your government is smart but this is something we enjoy very much
6688143 it must be martin javiers little two year old nephew
6688144 i forgotten his name so he is chinito i hope you dont mind haha
6688145 you have to start somewhere there is no point in your dancing career where you can say to yourself i am fully ready to teach it doesnt exist one always feels some inadequacy in his own dance even now i cringe when i think back of some of the things i told my students when i first started teaching you keep learning even as you teach slowly then you can build up your career and then move on to bigger things
6688146 i guess i would not dance as i do now if i did not start teaching and performing to teach is to learn
6688147 i admire those who spend years and only start when they are ready but thats definitely not my case even if i wanted to it was literally quite impossible to do that seven years ago
6688148 first of all teaching is very difficult without prior teaching experience it would be quite unwise to commit to so many classes
6688149 secondly judging from the size of the tango community in singapore less than 50 regular dancers you face the risk of getting low or even zero attendances for your classes rather than having many classes with few people it is better to have one class with many people the energy of the class would be higher and the students would have more fun
6688150 thirdly if you think about it putting your dancing level aside you are still dancing only for a little over than a year do you think a lot of the regular dancers who danced much longer than you would take classes from you on the flipside do you think you have enough time for publicity to get new students
6688151 the documents should be legalized separately each certificate should contain an individual piece of legalization paper from the argentine counsulate of your country
6688152 but the argentine consular looked through all the documents and he did put a stamp on each document
6688153 yes i know but every document should have a individual apostille paper and not as a bundle
6688154 the immigration department demands this and i cannot help you go to the argentina immigration department and appeal to them
6688155 we are going to close for summer vacations and will reopen early febuary good luck
6688156 fly 36 hours back to singapore to buy a 2 hour air ticket to jakarta and do everything again
6688157 firstly you should not have bundled your documents together we do not need your school results nor your passport to be legalized
6688158 the passport is an internationally recognized document it does not need to be legalized to be accepted legal in a foreign country
6688159 you did not need to legalize your singapore identification card we do not need it here for your student visa application
6688160 the birth certificate and the certificate of clean police record of singapore needs to be legalized as individual documents once that is done you do not need to legalize the copies
6688161 lastly you did not need to legalize the translated documents we do not recognize your translation official in singapore anyway you need to translate the papers with an appointed official translator here in buenos aires and you do not need to legalize the translation again
6688162 to summarize what you should have done is very simple for your student visa application in argentinas immigration office we only need four documents of which three of them you can get from your own country 1 passport 2 birth certificate 3 certificate of police record from singapore
6688163 of these three documents only two of them needs to be legalized and legalized separately the birth certificate and the certificate of police record from singapore
6688164 legalize them first in the ministry of foreign affairs of your own country singapore then bring them to our consulate representing singapore to legalize put an apostille paper
6688165 then the fourth document you need for your student visa application is a certificate of police record from argentina which you can apply here in buenos aires and that does not need to be legalized because it is from an argentine government agency
6688166 with these four documents go to our appointed official translator in buenos aires translate them and then apply directly to the university to get a letter of acceptance
6688167 your university might ask you to legalize also your singapore school documents but our immigration offices do not need them we only need your universitys letter of acceptance
6688168 once you get your letter of acceptance we can start your student visa process
6688169 im afraid you have to do two things now first bring all your documents which are in english to the official translating agency in buenos aires
6688170 second thing is to send your certificate of police record of singapore back to the argentina counsulate that represents singapore in this case situated in jakarta let them attach the legalization paper unto it and then have them send it back to you
6688171 the master of your fate the captain of your soul
6688172 this is not a novel it is a textbook on individual achievement that came directly from the experiences of hundreds of americas most successful men it should be studied digested and meditated upon no more than one chapter should be read in a single night the reader should underline the sentences which impress him most later he should go back to these marked lines and read them again a real student will not merely read this book he will absorb its contents and make them his own this book should be adopted by all high schools and no boy or girl should be permitted to graduate without having satisfactorily passed an examination on it this philosophy will not take the place of the subjects taught in schools but it will enable one to organize and apply the knowledge acquired and convert it into useful service and adequate compensation without waste of time
6688173 the very best example of the soundness of this philosophy is your own son blair whose dramatic story you have outlined in the chapter on desire
6688174 by applying many of the 17 fundamentals of the law of success philosophy we have built a great chain of successful stores i presume it would be no exaggeration of fact if i said that the woolworth building might properly be called a monument to the soundness of these principles
6688175 i feel greatly indebted for the privilege of reading your law of success if i had had this philosophy fifty years ago i suppose i could have accomplished all that i have done in less than half the time i sincerely hope the world will discover and reward you
6688176 mastery of the law of success philosophy is the equivalent of an insurance policy against failure
6688177 may i not congratulate you on your persistence any man who devotes that much time must of necessity make discoveries of great value to others i am deeply impressed by your interpretation of the master mind principles which you have so clearly described
6688178 i know that your 17 fundamentals of success are sound because i have been applying them in my business for more than 30 years
6688179 i know that you are doing a world of good with your law of success i would not care to set a monetary value on this training because it brings to the student qualities which cannot be measured by money alone
6688180 whatever success i may have attained i owe entirely to the application of your 17 fundamental principles of the law of success i believe i have the honor of being your first student
6688181 he stood there before me looking like an ordinary tramp but there was something in the expression of his face which conveyed the impression that he was determined to get what he had come after i had learned from years of experience with men that when a man really desires a thing so deeply that he is willing to stake his entire future on a single turn of the wheel in order to get it he is sure to win i gave him the opportunity he asked for because i saw he had made up his mind to stand by until he succeeded subsequent events proved that no mistake was made
6688182 when one is truly ready for a thing it puts in its appearance
6688183 ah well whats the use i guess ill change my mind and try for a salesmans job
6688184 i came here to go into business with edison and ill accomplish this end if it takes the remainder of my life
6688185 i stopped three feet from gold but i will never stop because men say no when i ask them to buy insurance
6688186 i told you to go on home now go or ill take a switch to you
6688187 what can you make of it what strange power did that child use that so completely whipped my uncle
6688188 every time a prospect tried to bow me out without buying i saw that child standing there in the old mill her big eyes glaring in defiance and i said to myself ive gotta make this sale the better portion of all sales i have made were made after people had said no
6688189 that experience was a blessing in disguise it taught me to keep on keeping on no matter how hard the going may be a lesson i needed to learn before i could succeed in anything
6688190 the queer slant of your eyes your eyes are off slant
6688191 and stay on the job until you succeed no matter how much time is required
6688192 the master of your fate the captain of your soul
6688193 i am the master of my fate i am the captain of my soul
6688194 with apologies i must state that the suggestion if acted upon will mean several years of labor and responsibility for you but i am en heartened to make the suggestion because i know your great love for rendering useful service
6688195 in 1922 you delivered the commencement address at salem college when i was a member of the graduating class
6688196 the suggestion i have in mind is that you put into a book the sum and substance of the address you delivered at salem college and in that way give the people of america an opportunity to profit by your many years of experience and association with the men who by their greatness have made america the richest nation on earth
6688197 i recall as though it were yesterday the marvelous description you gave of the method by which henry ford with but little schooling without a dollar with no influential friends rose to great heights i made up my mind then even before you had finished 44
6688198 thousands of young people will finish their schooling this year and within the next few years
6688199 if there is any possible way that you can afford to render so great a service may i offer the suggestion that you include with every book one of your personal analysis charts in order that the purchaser of the book may have the benefit of a complete self inventory indicating as you indicated to me years ago exactly what is standing in the way of success
6688200 such a service as this providing the readers of your book with a complete unbiased picture of their faults and their virtues would mean to them the difference between success and failure
6688201 millions of people are now facing the problem of staging a come back because of the depression and i speak from personal experience when i say i know these earnest people would welcome the opportunity to tell you their problems and to receive your suggestions for the solution
6688202 you know the problems of those who face the necessity of beginning all over again
6688203 if you publish the book i would like to own the first copy that comes from the press personally autographed by you 45
6688204 i will try to induce edison to give me a job of some sort
6688205 i will see edison and put him on notice that i have come to go into business with him
6688206 i will work there for a few months and if i get no encouragement i will quit and get a job somewhere else
6688207 i will keep my eyes open for another opportunity in case i fail to get what i want in the edison organization
6688208 there is but one thing in this world that i am determined to have and that is a business association with thomas a
6688209 gentlemen on that very spot i will build the worlds greatest store no matter how many times it may burn down
6688210 the greatest achievement was at first and for a time but a dream
6688211 every proverb every book every byword that belongs to thee for aid and comfort shall surely come home through open or winding passages
6688212 i bargained with life for a penny and life would pay no more however i begged at evening when i counted my scanty store
6688213 for life is a just employer he gives you what you ask but once you have set the wages why you must bear the task
6688214 i worked for a menials hire only to learn dismayed that any wage i had asked of life life would have willingly paid
6688215 the whole course of things goes to teach us faith we need only obey there is guidance for each of us and by lowly listening we shall hear the right word
6688216 our only limitations are those we set up in our own minds
6688217 theoretically the boy should not be able to hear at all
6688218 with such a face and with no personality at all how can you ever expect to succeed in opera my good child give up the idea buy a sewing machine and go to work you can never be a singer
6688219 do not be disturbed chief i will be out of here in a few days
6688220 nothing but his own desire to live saved him he never would have pulled through if he had not refused to accept the possibility of death
6688221 when men first come into contact with crime they abhor it if they remain in contact with crime for a time they become accustomed to it and endure it if they remain in contact with it long enough they finally embrace it and become influenced by it
6688222 faith is a state of mind and that it may be induced by self suggestion
6688223 my god this will kill me i cannot stand the disgrace
6688224 if you think you are beaten you are if you think you dare not you dont if you like to win but you think you cant it is almost certain you wont
6688225 if you think youll lose youre lost for out of the world we find success begins with a fellows will its all in the state of mind
6688226 if you think you are outclassed you are youve got to think high to rise youve got to be sure of yourself before you can ever win a prize
6688227 lifes battles dont always go to the stronger or faster man but soon or late the man who wins is the man who thinks he can
6688228 when on the evening of december 12 1900 some eighty of the nations financial nobility gathered in the banquet hall of the university club on fifth avenue to do honor to a young man from out of the west not half a dozen of the guests realized they were to witness the most significant episode in american industrial history
6688229 j edward simmons and charles stewart smith their hearts full of gratitude for the lavish hospitality bestowed on them by charles m schwab during a recent visit to pittsburgh had arranged the dinner to introduce the thirty eight year old steel man to eastern banking society 82
6688230 even john pierpont morgan sitting on the right hand of schwab as became his imperial dignity intended to grace the banquet table with his presence only briefly
6688231 so the two hosts and their distinguished guests ate their way through the usual seven or eight courses
6688232 it is perhaps unfortunate for the sake of history that no record of charlie schwabs speech at the dinner ever was made
6688233 it is probable however that it was a homely speech somewhat ungrammatical for the niceties of language never bothered schwab full of epigram and threaded with wit
6688234 the magic of the schwab personality had been turned on full force but what was more important and lasting was the full fledged clear cut program he laid down for the aggrandizement of steel
6688235 the financial magnetism that began a generation ago to attract thousands of small and sometimes inefficiently managed companies into large and competition crushing combinations had become operative in the steel world through the devices of that jovial business pirate john w
6688236 but by the side of andrew carnegies gigantic vertical trust a trust owned and operated by fifty three partners those other combinations were picayune
6688237 the eccentric old scot knew it too from the magnificent heights of skibo castle he had viewed first with amusement and then with resentment the attempts of morgans smaller companies to cut into his 84
6688238 so it was that in the speech of charles m
6688239 schwabs speech on the night of december 12 1900 undoubtedly carried the inference though not the pledge that the vast carnegie enterprise could be brought under the morgan tent
6688240 more than that he told the buccaneers among them wherein lay the errors of their customary piracy
6688241 so the dinner at the university club came to an end morgan went home to think about schwabs rosy predictions schwab went back to pittsburgh to run the steel business for wee andra carnegie while gary and the 85
6688242 now certain economic historians have professed the belief that from the beginning to the end of the drama the stage was set by andrew carnegie that the dinner to schwab the famous speech the sunday night conference between schwab and the money king were events arranged by the canny scot
6688243 do you think you can persuade andrew carnegie to sell
6688244 if you can get him to sell i will undertake the matter said morgan
6688245 there was a golf game in january on the frost cracking heath of the st
6688246 the figure was approximately 400 000 000 and was reached by taking the 320 000 000 mentioned by schwab as a basic figure and adding to it 80 000 000 to represent the increased capital value over the previous two years
6688247 later on the deck of a trans atlantic liner the scotsman said ruefully to morgan i wish i had asked you for 100 000 000 more
6688248 the thirty eight year old schwab had his reward he was made president of the new corporation and remained in control until 1930
6688249 day by day in every way i am getting better and better
6688250 fix in your own mind the exact amount of money you desire
6688251 create a definite plan for carrying out your desire and begin at once to put this plan into action
6688252 in return for this money i will give the most efficient service of which i am capable rendering the fullest possible quantity and the best possible quality of service in the capacity of salesman of
6688253 i believe that i will have this money in my possession my faith is so strong that i can now see this money before my eyes i can touch it with my hands it is now awaiting transfer to me at the time and in the proportion that i deliver the service i intend to render in return for it i am awaiting a plan by which to accumulate this money and i will follow that plan when it is received
6688254 i am the master of my fate i am the captain of my soul
6688255 how many soldiers did the british send over to america to put down the rebellion of 1776
6688256 i do not know the exact number of soldiers the british sent over but i have heard that it was a considerably larger number than ever went back
6688257 if i should really want to answer the foolish question you have just asked or any of the other questions you have been asking me let me remind you that i have a row of electric push buttons on my desk and by pushing the right button i can summon to my aid men who can answer any question i desire to ask concerning the business to which i am devoting most of my efforts
6688258 particularly sought after by employing companies are candidates who have specialized in some field business school graduates with training in accounting and statistics engineers of all varieties journalists architects chemists and also outstanding leaders and activity men of the senior class

6688263 proposing a system of apprenticing students in offices stores and industrial occupations during the summer vacation mr
6688264 colleges and universities must face the practical consideration that all professions and occupations now demand specialists
6688265 i couldnt go to school because i have a family to support
6688266 i like the idea but i would not know how to turn it into cash
6688267 why go to all this trouble to secure a job
6688268 all the world loves a winner and has no time for a loser
6688269 ah well my idea is a good one but i cannot do anything with it because i never can procure the necessary million dollars
6688270 one saturday afternoon i sat in my room thinking of ways and means of raising the money to carry out my plans
6688271 i made up my mind then and there that i would get the necessary million dollars within a week
6688272 things began to happen in a hurry i called the newspapers and announced i would preach a sermon the following morning entitled what i would do if i had a million dollars 126
6688273 i went to work on the sermon immediately but i must tell you frankly the task was not difficult because i had been preparing that sermon for almost two years
6688274 next morning i arose early went into the bathroom read the sermon then knelt on my knees and asked that my sermon might come to the attention of someone who would supply the needed money
6688275 while i was praying i again had that feeling of assurance that the money would be forthcoming
6688276 it was too late to go back for my notes and what a blessing that i couldnt go back
6688277 when i had finished and sat down a man slowly arose from his seat about three rows from the rear and made his way toward the pulpit
6688278 do unto others as you would have others do unto you
6688279 the greatest among ye shall be the servant of all
6688280 as the twig is bent so shall the tree grow
6688281 we will pay you all you are worth after we try you out for a week
6688282 because i am getting more than that where i am now employed
6688283 where may one find favorable opportunities to apply these principles
6688284 tell the world what you intend to do but first show it
6688285 for the purpose of friendly cooperation for the betterment of the colonies of british america
6688286 i tell you further that if two of you agree upon the earth concerning anything for which you ask it will come to you from my father who is in heaven
6688287 i have been authorized by governor gage to assure you mr adams that the governor has been empowered to confer upon you such benefits as would be satisfactory endeavor to win adams by promise of bribes upon the condition that you engage to cease in your opposition to the measures of the government it is the governors advice to you sir not to incur the further displeasure of his majesty your conduct has been such as makes you liable to penalties of an act of henry viii by which persons can be sent to england for trial for treason or misprision of treason at the discretion of a governor of a province but by changing your political course you will not only receive great personal advantages but you will make your peace with the king
6688288 then you may tell governor gage that i trust i have long since made my peace with the king of kings no personal consideration shall induce me to abandon the righteous cause of my country and tell governor gage it is the advice of samuel adams to him no longer to insult the feelings of an exasperated people
6688289 i do hereby in his majestys name offer and promise his most gracious pardon to all persons who shall forthwith lay down their arms and return to the duties of peaceable subjects excepting only from the benefit of such pardon samuel adams and john hancock whose offences are of too flagitious a nature to admit of any other consideration but that of condign punishment
6688290 if this be treason then make the most of it
6688291 gentlemen i make the motion that these united colonies are and of right ought to be free and independent states that they be absolved from all allegiance to the british crown and that all political connection between them and the state of great britain is and ought to be totally dissolved
6688292 mr president we have discussed this issue for days it is the only course for us to follow why then sir do we longer delay why still deliberate let this happy day give birth to an american republic let her arise not to devastate and to conquer but to reestablish the reign of peace and of law the eyes of europe are fixed upon us she demands of us a living example of freedom that may exhibit a contrast in the felicity of the citizen to the ever increasing tyranny
6688293 when in the course of human events it is necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of natures god entitle them a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation
6688294 every failure brings with it the seed of an equivalent advantage
6688295 very well broadway you may whip some but not me im going to force you to give up
6688296 aw whats the use you dont know when youre whipped so name your price and go to work in earnest
6688297 dont aim so high people will think you are crazy

6688299 to thine own self be true and it must follow as the night the day thou canst not then be false to any man
6688300 with all these blessings king edward should have found peace of mind contentment and joy of living
6688301 he among you who is without sin let him cast the first stone
6688302 blessed is the man who has come to know that our muted thoughts are our sweetest thoughts

6688305 his career never made sense mohammed was born to impoverished members of a leading family of mecca because mecca the crossroads of 209
6688306 the koran the revealed word of god was the closest thing to a miracle in mohammeds life
6688307 the rise of islam began out of the desert came a flame which would not be extinguished a democratic army fighting as a unit and prepared to die without wincing mohammed had invited the jews and christians to join him for he was not building a new religion he was calling all who believed in one god to join in a single faith if the jews and christians had 210 slide 211 accepted his invitation islam would have conquered the world they didnt they would not even accept mohammeds innovation of humane warfare when the armies of the prophet entered jerusalem not a single person was killed because of his faith when the crusaders entered the city centuries later not a moslem man woman or child was spared but the christians did accept one moslem idea the place of learning the university
6688308 coordination of knowledge and effort in a spirit of harmony between two or more people for the attainment of a definite purpose
6688309 no two minds ever come together without thereby creating a third invisible intangible force which may be likened to a third mind
6688310 men take on the nature and the habits and the power of thought of those with whom they associate in a spirit of sympathy and harmony

6688313 a man who has discovered how to increase the vibrations of thought to the point where he can freely communicate with sources of knowledge not available through the ordinary rate of vibration of thought
6688314 how may one communicate with sources of knowledge which are not available through the ordinary rate of vibration of thought
6688315 are there known sources of knowledge which are available only to genii and if so what are these sources and exactly how may they be reached
6688316 i do it because then i speak through ideas which come to me from within
6688317 with my eyes closed i am able to draw upon a source of superior intelligence
6688318 the ordered intermingling of the real and the dream the mill above the river and the mist above the stream

6688321 you never can tell what a thought will do in bringing you hate or love for thoughts are things and their airy wings are swifter than carrier doves they follow the law of the universe each thing creates its kind and they speed o er the track to bring you back whatever went out from your mind
6688322 that astronomical figures dealing with hundreds of millions of light years become insignificant by comparison
6688323 a month ago we cited on this page some of the remarkable results achieved by professor rhine and his associates in duke university from more than a hundred thousand tests to determine the existence of telepathy and clairvoyance
6688324 the actual existence of telepathy and clairvoyance now seems to some scientists enormously probable as the result of rhines experiments
6688325 one conclusion that wright draws with some confidence is that telepathy and clairvoyance are really one and the same gift
6688326 napoleon i desire to acquire from you by emulation the marvelous ability you possessed to inspire men and to arouse them to greater and more determined spirit of action
6688327 mr edison i have seated you nearest to me at my right because of the personal cooperation you have given me during my research into the causes of success and failure i wish to acquire from you the marvelous spirit of faith with which you have uncovered so many of natures secrets the spirit of unremitting toil with which you have so often wrested victory from defeat
6688328 my boy you will need much courage if you remain steadfast in carrying out your purpose in life but remember when difficulties overtake you the common people have common sense adversity will develop it
6688329 you are destined to witness the discovery of the secret of life when the time comes you will observe that life consists of great swarms of energy or entities each as intelligent as human beings think themselves to be these units of life group together like hives of bees and remain together until they disintegrate through lack of harmony these units have differences of opinion the same as human beings and often fight among themselves these meetings which you are conducting will be very helpful to you they will bring to your rescue some of the same units of life which served the members of your cabinet during their lives these units are eternal they never die your own thoughts and desires serve as the magnet which attracts units of life from the great ocean of life out there only the friendly units are attracted the ones which harmonize with the nature of your desires
6688330 your dream was more a reality than you may imagine it to have been
6688331 the world will soon need your services it is about to undergo a period of chaos which will cause men and women to lose faith and become panic stricken go ahead with your work and complete your philosophy that is your mission in life if you neglect it for any cause whatsoever you will be reduced to a primal state and be compelled to retrace the cycles through which you have passed during thousands of years
6688332 gentlemen let us drink a toast to a friend who has returned to the fold
6688333 why did you write a book about money why measure riches in dollars alone
6688334 give me all the money i need and i will find everything else i want
6688335 money is only clam shells or metal discs or scraps of paper and there are treasures of the heart and soul which money cannot buy but most people being broke are unable to keep this in mind and sustain their spirits
6688336 these people even his friends feel on the other hand a sense of superiority and regard him perhaps unconsciously as a casualty
6688337 when a man is down and out he has time on his hands for brooding
6688338 he sees thousands of other people bookkeepers or clerks or chemists or wagon hands busy at their work and envies them from the bottom of his soul
6688339 it is just money which makes this difference in him
6688340 some employers take the most shocking advantage of people who are down and out the agencies hang out little colored cards offering miserable wages to busted men 12 a week 15 a week an 18 a week job is a plum and anyone with 25 a week to offer does not hang the job in front of an agency on a colored card i have a want ad clipped from a local paper demanding a clerk a good clean penman to take telephone orders for a sandwich shop from 11 a m to 2 p m for 8 a month not 8 a week but 8 a month the ad says also state religion can you imagine the brutal effrontery of anyone who demands a good clean penman for 11 cents an hour inquiring into the victims religion but that is what busted people are offered
6688341 gentlemen i feel it necessary to ask you not to publish any scare headlines concerning the flu epidemic unless you cooperate with me we will have a situation which we cannot control

6688343 come into my tent embrace my faith accept my dogmas and i will give you a ticket that will admit you straightaway into heaven when you die
6688344 and may the devil take you and burn you throughout eternity
6688345 it feels fine just think brother my troubles will soon be over i have had nothing but trouble all my life it has been a hardship to get food and clothing soon i will not need these things i have felt fine ever since i learned for certain that i must die i made up my mind then to accept my fate in good spirit

6688348 it was a great surprise to me when i discovered that most of the ugliness i saw in others was but a reflection of my own nature
6688349 why people spend so much time deliberately fooling themselves by creating alibis to cover their weaknesses if used differently this same time would be sufficient to cure the weakness then no alibis would be needed
6688350 life is a checkerboard and the player opposite you is time if you hesitate before moving or neglect to move promptly your men will be wiped off the board by time you are playing against a partner who will not tolerate indecision

6688352 if i had a young son i would insist that he read every word of the
6688353 allow me to express my appreciation of the compliment you have paid me in sending the original manuscript of the law of success i can see you have spent a great deal of time and thought in its preparation your philosophy is sound and you are to be congratulated for sticking to your work over so long a period of years your students will be amply rewarded for their labor
6688354 your work and mine are peculiarly akin i am helping the laws of nature to create more perfect specimens of vegetation while you are using those same laws through the law of success to build more perfect specimens of thinkers
6688355 certainly i will supply you with the information you request this i consider to be not only a duty but it is a pleasure as well you are laboring in behalf of the people who have neither the time nor the inclination to ferret out the causes of failure and success
6688356 our entire business policy in the management of our hotels is based upon the 17 fundamentals of the law of success of which i am a student
6688357 i feel greatly indebted for the privilege of reading your law of success philosophy if i had had this fifty years ago i suppose i could have accomplished all that i have done in less than half the time i sincerely hope the world will discover and reward you
6688358 napoleon hill has produced what i believe to be the first practical philosophy of achievement its major distinguishing feature is the simplicity in which it has been presented
6688359 the best evidence of the soundness of the law of success with which i am personally acquainted is the noteworthy achievement of mr curtis who has built one of the greatest publishing businesses in the world by applying the principles of this philosophy
6688360 you may say for mr rockefeller that he endorses mr hills 17 fundamental principles of success and that he recommends them to those who are seeking the highway to achievement

6688388 just three weeks ago westons main attraction burned down and i feel it is now we need to look to the future and move with the times
6688389 with the regeneration being proposed in weston the seaside resort can be great again we would not be considering this long term investment if we did not think so
6688390 we have a great beach and wonderful shops but tourists will want more and we have to provide that for them otherwise they will continue to go abroad and thats the last thing we want
6688391 if everything goes to plan weston could have two great new attractions by 2010

6688399 we dont have the processes in space to remove excess heat or keep the spacecraft warm in excess cold
6688400 it may sound very trivial but controlling the temperature of a spacecraft is absolutely crucial
6688401 but of course we then have no choice but to sit in the opposition i would very much like to see this coalition stay in tact i would be the last person who wants to see it disintegrating but this coalition wasnt without an agenda and that agenda is strengthening democracy the rule of law and to restore the constitution and judges the judges were illegally removed without any constitutional authority so if we dont restore them what are we doing thats the core issue
6688402 the glue that was holding the coalition partners together was mr musharraf now that punching bag has gone
6688403 the coalition may not continue if the judges are not restored
6688404 the muttahida qaumi movement mqm will endorse and second the ppp cecs recommendation to nominate asif zardari as a presidential candidate
6688405 in case the pml n does not support asif zardaris candidature the ppp will have the support of the mqm anp jui f pml q forward bloc and some smaller parties in the centre and the provinces besides the fata and independent members
6688406 mr zardari feels that you have been misinformed and that the case that you are referring to is closed

6688436 enhancing brain chemistry is a very specialized discipline in the nutritional field when you undertake a project to invent a highly specialized mental support product for someone who demands the best in everything like phil then you are free to explore the cost is no object parameter when tailoring the formula for high performance needs we knew we were on the right track when we were in our 3rd iteration of the prototype formulas that is when the company test dummies began to beg for more product every time they ran out from there we just kept honing the formula until it performed beyond even our own lofty intentions in the eleven years we have been working to develop new formulas this is the one that has taken longer to bring to market than any other you cant take shortcuts when you are designing a mental support product when working with materials that enhance the brain there is simply no room for compromise

6688450 i dont know how many blocks he had in the third set

6688452 not to be absolutely certain is i think one of the essential things in rationality
6688453 its a small world but i wouldnt want to paint it
6688454 i didnt have any idea what was going to be a good score out here its definitely not that easy its perfect conditions
6688455 i wanted to get that out of my system and just play golf today and i did
6688456 so my 1 under par round is not as good as i thought it would be but i thought i played well and ill take it
6688457 were very pleased that after a rewarding period of consultation with scottish teachers we have now launched these services
6688458 i am sure they will make an invaluable contribution to the wellbeing of scottish teachers and thereby the education of scottish children
6688459 merely having someone to talk to when stressed is not sufficient
6688460 the scottish government and local authorities need to modify the demands and expectations on teachers so that they dont have unrealistic burdens placed upon them
6688461 for example it can very stressful for teachers during inspections and when reports are being prepared there are issues with class sizes
6688462 teachers are expected to know every pupil as an individual and write reports
6688463 teachers were supposed to get significant additional support and clerical staff as part of the mccrone report to free up their time but they are being squeezed by local authority budget cuts
6688464 the real challenge is to get to the root of what is causing the stress and in many cases it is the fact that the schools do not have enough powers to deal with indiscipline
6688465 we place tremendous value on the welfare of teachers and the vital work they do for scotlands young people
6688466 if we are going to create a prime ministerial position he or she should have responsibility to run government
6688467 if we are going to create a position of prime minister not only should he or she have authority to run government but should also have powers to drive and transform government one cannot be a junior partner to another it is not the sharing of position but it is the sharing of power

6688470 what was reported by some media with regard to syrias agreement on deploying iskander missiles in its territories are baseless
6688471 military and technical cooperation of course is the main issue
6688472 we have a group of very talented sailors who are driven to ensure they leave no stone unturned in the quest for olympic gold those sailors are supported by a great group of coaches and support staff to help them fulfil their potential
6688473 what joy domestic sport stars delivering world beating performances under maximum pressure in place of the usual hard luck stories and feeble excuses for failure we have feasted at the top table of olympic prowess
6688474 its a fitting tribute to the outstanding achievements of the whole team
6688475 in athens the countrys medal total was 30 which was fewer than nine other countries but in beijing the empire has bounced back
6688476 we take our hats off to what has been done by the competitors

6688479 without long term training programmes we cant maintain the level of our athletes and have little chance of winning medals
6688480 china is set to win 50 golds at the beijing olympics clearing the shame of winning five golds at the 1988 seoul olympics
6688481 this success is due to support from the whole country and chinas devil style training those who can survive the devil style training can win gold
6688482 devil style training chinas road to gold is paved with blood and tears
6688483 in china the state trains athletes from kindergarten until they win medals paying their salary hiring coaches and building gymnasiums
6688484 in the west athletes train in clubs and pay for training hours coaches and the use of swimming pool
6688485 in taiwan everything is amateur young athletes train after they finish class in the afternoon
6688486 the soviet style training does not suit taiwan because it contradicts human nature and the athletes are unhappy
6688487 it works in china because chinese people are used to being told what to do by the government
6688488 when many people take up sports we will have outstanding athletes who can win medals
6688489 the rebels have abandoned their satellite camp due to intense bombardment
6688490 the rebels were trying to take control of the highway

6688493 but i dont think you expected him to lift you that high
6688494 my advice to you is if you want to test if somethings genuine poke it or ask it some questions and see if it bites back well im biting back im fighting back
6688495 i woke up quite early feeling like times running out and somethings scratching at my door ive just got to keep on doing shows because its a good honest living if you can make people have a good time and dance
6688496 and its not a passing trend its something i can do till im old
6688497 i think thats what woke me up this morning i heard these really slick blues licks on the guitar and this sexy little blues voice whats this oh no its radio 2s record of the week the b s have basically dug up the corpse of john lee hooker and then forced her to perform unnatural acts over the top of his cadaver in the town square aaah its a dirty word blues right now it just smells of money and blues is working mans music but damn it
6688498 i played harmonica when i was 13 years old because id seen some guys come up from chicago the lyrics they didnt make much sense to me then but once you fall down a few flights of stairs and have illegitimate children running around or get thrown in the drunk tank a few times im not saying ive done all of the above but once that happens then those lyrics make perfect sense i wont go into the personal stuff but yeah its been pretty hairy
6688499 it was so cold in winter that your spit will freeze before it hits the ground
6688500 tough but optimistic people the sky is blue there its grimmer here ive been here 12 years its very competitive but i was always drawn to the big fight i wouldnt want to fail in a little place
6688501 crash test dummies was a good job to have in my twenties
6688502 and this is a good job to have in my thirties and forties i might just change a few more times life is long and thats a good thing to remind people of
6688503 im up here on the riser youre selling records for the kaiser
6688504 people abandon what was last year let alone 50 years old because it isnt modern
6688505 the majority see beauty in gold diamonds and whatever is presented to them as new
6688506 the idea is to be anti fashion not buying what youre told but finding things that are left overs discarded youre supposed to get married when youre 20 and get a nice big diamond and work hard to pay off the loan for it and wear this years jeans that bulls t is whats tipping the global environment into the drink
6688507 but of late i feel ive already got my style im set in my ways i scratch uncontrollably i have other filthy nervous habits that i do around the house and those arent going to change and its the same with my harmonica playing
6688508 i need a new beautiful woman to give me books
6688509 there was a beautiful woman in canada who used to she ripped the covers off bless her so i wouldnt know what i was reading ive been reading the old f scott fitzgerald tender is the night there are a lot of similar themes going on in my life
6688510 poke it and see if it screams see if it hits you back because it is insulting if youre suggesting im as inauthentic as bob dylan whos from a state six hours drive from me which in north america is close a little middle american kid whose parents were in schmutter
6688511 the truth lies in the timeline i was sharing a dressing room with a 92 year old man who played with robert johnson honeyboy edwards if he and i are in the same dressing room and going on the same stage then the music is ours
6688512 were not talking about something from seven generations ago the time between us is a blip things do not disappear if its 50 years old its still absolutely alive

6688517 you put him right in the heart of a grade school and a high school
6688518 bishop keleher said we must take care of a brother priest but the diocese must also be considered
6688519 bishop suggested a hospital chaplaincy somewhere this could be dangerous
6688520 its hard to explain but when youre raised catholic you believe a priest is taking the place of a father or of god if i had known what was happening i would not have let my son anywhere near him i trusted a priest
6688521 i went up and put my arms around him and told him i loved him i respected him and i would stand by him 100 percent
6688522 police were called to a domestic related incident in the galliagh area of londonderry shortly before 3am on saturday morning august 16 it was reported that a man had locked himself in a house with his two children
6688523 a taser unit was discharged by specialist firearms officers during the incident as an appropriate and proportionate tactical option to bring the matter to a safe conclusion
6688524 at 6 50am one 37 year old man was arrested and detained under the mental health act the children were safely returned to a family member
6688525 the police ombudsman of northern ireland poni was informed and are carrying out an investigation in line with protocols
6688526 its not just in you its in every choice you make
6688527 northern ireland gcse students continue to excel and should be proud of the results they have produced this year
6688528 options include staying on at school to do a levels going to a further education college and going into employment
6688529 this can be a very anxious time for young people and their parents as they often have to make decisions fairly quickly
6688530 if you do not get the grades you wanted dont panic or make hasty decisions there will be an option that will suit you
6688531 the careers service can talk you through your options and help you to make an informed decision
6688532 congratulations to all involved in achieving these excellent results and the teachers and parents who inspired and motivated our young students
6688533 however while overall these are excellent results too many young people are leaving education without five gcses that is one of the reasons why i have a number of reforms under way to improve the education system
6688534 if you did not achieve the results you had hoped for today is not a day to panic as there are many other opportunities available to you and i would urge you to examine these fully
6688535 it was terrifying the smell of smoke was overpowering it was thick and rancid mum led me out
6688536 we were on the fourth floor and i have to say the firemen were magnificent in evacuating the place were thanking our lucky stars that we came through it
6688537 we were led down four flights of stairs and were coughing our lungs out when we reached the street i had the presence of mind to grab our passports some money and coats but we had to spend the next couple of days dressed in coats and our pyjamas as the shops were closed
6688538 we spent two nights in the foyer of a second hotel and then we were transferred to a third one we didnt get much sleep
6688539 i was one of the first of the disabled skiers there
6688540 only three of us arrived early englishman stephen armstrong who is blind irishman eamon prunty who is in a wheelchair and myself
6688541 wed managed to buy new clothes by then and luckily i had met an italian skiing friend when we arrived at the airport and he took all my sports equipment out to the lake venue and i was able to practice and compete
6688542 but there was no way i was going to pull out after all that drama and i went ahead with it strapped up
6688543 i didnt win any medals but as ever the experience was excellent and will stand me in good stead for next years world championships
6688544 its been a horrific week but im used to that sort of thing ill be delighted to get home
6688545 i would expect something to happen before the transfer window closes
6688546 it was very tough it was difficult last season but whatever doesnt kill you makes you stronger
6688547 you are playing against better players stronger players who are sharper and quicker and it makes you mentally and physically better
6688548 but its partly my own fault that im not playing at that level so it is up to me to get myself back there
6688549 i was informed that wigan want to sign me on loan but they are yet to contact middlesbrough
6688550 wigan coach steve bruce admires my abilities he has tried to sign me when he was in charge of birmingham and now he has renewed his interest
6688551 i will take my final decision next week after meeting middlesbrough coach gareth southgate
6688552 southgate told me that he wants to keep me at the riverside i will talk with him to settle on the best choice
6688553 i seek regular first team football both clubs can offer me equal chances to play on a regular basis both of them have very good strikers also
6688554 but im sure i can force my way into the starting xi of any team once i regain full fitness
6688555 i may opt to stay at middlesbrough for the sake of stability i settled in there after spending a whole season with them

6688566 the ministry of culture welcomes all attempts at creativity it has not been consulted by the organisers regarding the artists whose works are to be displayed at the summit
6688567 in fact the ministry of culture has recently invited m f husain to become a member of the national culture fund council
6688568 as far as the present art summit is concerned the ministry would be happy if works of all major artists including those of m f husain are displayed

6688570 i was not setting out to make an issue film but morality has become to us only about virginity and vegetarianism if you are a vegetarian virgin nothing you do is immoral you could be absolutely ruthless in making money kill someone even
6688571 as long as you dont eat the person you have killed of course
6688572 the baniyafication of our culture has ruined our movies so i can stand on my terrace and listen to families fighting calling each other maa behn gaalis that is real but producers used to tell me that my movie about a father son relationship was too westernised because the son talked back to the father perhaps it does not happen in the joint families of our mercantile class but it certainly happens in india
6688573 there was always rich and poor but now the spending is more visible sooner or later someone will catch on that walking down the street is a pair of shoes that costs three times his income why not knock out the wearer and steal the shoes
6688574 it had a russian gangster his porn star girlfriend and the porn filmmaker who falls in love with her i thought i could adapt it for india i thought mumbai would be like new york but with more indians
6688575 we were self taught but did quite well we made logos fly
6688576 i got ad films almost immediately but bollywood was suspicious and unfriendly all the great art movements have come out of creative people sharing their work their preoccupations and ideas but nobody here seems to get that
6688577 i hate living in cities cut off from any culture other than bollywood
6688578 what i miss most about living abroad are the libraries and museums and music my children definitely have less access to culture or intellectual activity than i did when i grew up newer spaces like gurgaon are completely devoid of anything even remotely cultural if we must import from the west why not import the best i certainly dont miss mcdonalds why not be like china and have great philharmonic orchestras forget art we dont even have pop culture thats why we have movies like dhoom where in india do we have motorcycle gangs
6688579 small towns just have more colour most big cities look like each other
6688580 movies are either in new york or in never never land you look at characters in a movie and you dont know who they are where they are where they are from
6688581 say you are watching a tamil film it has a well defined catchment area so the location of the characters caste class everything is very clear the problem for bollywood is this who is its natural audience who speaks hindi nobody does when i had two minutes of hindi as its spoken anywhere in rajasthan in manorama people complained that its a dialect and that they couldnt understand it so we have movies about nowhere for people from nowhere
6688582 fleets of buses going from weymouth and dorchester filled with fans in claret and white shirts
6688583 how much trouble could it possibly be to make our own cupcakes
6688584 early on i made a 360 deal with myself what separates me is that i always had a blueprint to be a lifestyle brand the things people are talking about doing now i already did i always wanted to diversify

6688814 losing ground how the loss of adequate health insurance is burdening working families
6688815 this report tells us once again our families deserve health care reform that lowers costs and covers all americans senator obamas health care plan would cut costs by 2500 for a typical family cover all americans and get tough on insurance companies so that our health care system puts patients first again unfortunately senator mccains health care plan will make the problems in our health care system far worse by radically restructuring the system taxing health care benefits for the first time and providing incentives to employers to drop health care coverage
6688816 there are still some issues to work out but its very premature at this point to say that we have an agreement
6688817 the reason we are where we are today talking about this kind of agreement is that the surge worked iraqi forces have demonstrated that they are strong and getting stronger and we are making progress together in the defeat of iraqs enemies of all stripes
6688818 and we can look forward to an agreement or we can look forward to a set of circumstances in which we know what is needed in the future in terms of roles responsibilities numbers
6688819 we are very close to finalize this important agreement for iraq for the region and for the friendship and the partnership of iraq and the united states

6688828 just as they are to their families and their communities women have been invaluable to baracks efforts to bring change to this country tens of thousands of women have organized for us traveled to battleground states and carried our message to all corners of this country im looking forward to working with our torchbearers to continue this effort and mobilize for the election
6688829 women make up the majority of the electorate and its our votes that will decide this historic election
6688830 women have always been at the forefront of creating change in our country from teachers to sorority presidents mothers shaping the next generation or volunteers small business women or public servants young women impact our neighborhoods and our lives every day all across the country women recognize that the stakes in this election are too high and as a woman for obama torchbearer they will harness their energy through grassroots mobilization to ensure that barack obama is elected president in november
6688831 i am proud to have the support of these national and state leaders within the sportsmens community and know that their support is integral to my bid to become your next president it would be an honor to serve as your president and carry on the guiding principles of theodore roosevelt americas foremost conservation president
6688832 john mccain has been a leader and a friend to sportsmen and gun owners for over 25 years
6688833 sportsmen should know john mccain understands our community and will fight to protect and promote the sportsmens agenda
6688834 while the choice for sportsmen is clear we are going to continue to share that message with our friends at the range on the lake and in the woods to ensure our fellow angler conservationist and friend john mccain is elected as our next president
6688835 president musharraf has made the right decision to step down as president of pakistan

6688837 the cultural value system has been something missing missing something some internal value standard that used to be very strong in oriental culture korean culture now its too much materialistic too achievement oriented
6688838 what that means is that the social support system has changed
6688839 previously it was very close knit family mutually dependent helping each other now its very independent small family and when things happen you have very little support from other people

6688847 the tankers exterior lighting is not currently compatible with night vision goggle operations which limits the receivers ability to use their night vision systems during air refueling operations
6688848 our solution is simple modify tanker aircraft with night vision friendly exterior lighting and night vision compatible interior lighting for the boom pod this can have an immediate impact for our tanker forces in the deployed theater
6688849 the idea is to make air refueling at night safer
6688850 right now during night time air refueling operations in black out conditions pilots in aircraft receiving fuel have to remove their night vision goggles prior to an air refueling to prevent required visual references from being washed out or obscured in the night vision goggle image also current external lighting on the aircraft is easily detected by ground threats using the unaided eye correcting these deficiencies has a direct impact on mission accomplishment and safety in flight
6688851 in setting this up we looked for low cost commercial and government off the shelf lighting technology to make the kc 135 exterior and boom pod interior lighting selectively night vision compatible yet undetectable to the unaided eye
6688852 then the afrl stepped in and designed and installed the lighting solutions to save time and cost and to decrease risk lighting luminance assessments were done in a controlled laboratory environment prior to hardware installation on the kc 135 used for the demonstration
6688853 this initiative showed that a low cost night vision lighting alternative is out there and is feasible we found that a night vision lighting system can eliminate the time necessary for receiver pilots to don or doff their night vision equipment while performing night time air refueling operations this is an improved capability when compared to the current operations in the field
6688854 the national guard bureau and other agencies are pursuing funding to accomplish flight and environmental testing on the night vision lighting system
6688855 it is ambs recommendation this initiative be considered for fielding by air mobility command as resources allow and requirements dictate
6688856 i dont train as hard as ive done for a silver medal
6688857 its all about a gold or nothing i put absolutely everything into this and the gold was there and it was still open
6688858 i think maybe ive done something to my hand ive done something to my sciatic nerve and ive cut my shoulder quite a few things
6688859 awww right beijing are you ready for the main event weve got sammy cools running on the five track out of canada weve got shanaze reade out of great britain
6688860 they say you learn the hard way and i definitely learnt the hard way today
6688861 i put my heart and my soul and everything into it but a true winner always comes back stronger and im going to show everyone what im made of
6688862 theres a lot of pressure on her young shoulders and in the final you probably saw experience over youth
6688863 but shes got her first olympic games under her belt and it looks good for london shes got such a big engine and so much raw power that if the number of track events increases i can certainly see her doing more than one
6688864 the advice ill be giving her is to have a word with vicky tonight and ask her how she felt she was going to pack it in but she came back and dominated i think shanaze can do the same shes a true warrior but you need experience too and today wasnt her day
6688865 childrens rejection of unpalatable medications and bitter tasting foods is a complex product of maturing sensory systems genetic variation experiences and culture
6688866 the number one reason for non compliance among children when taking medicine or eating vegetables is that they dont like the taste
6688867 just look at a childs face when theyre eating some of these things
6688868 we find that the more a mother eats fruits when shes pregnant the more a child will accept fruits and vegetables
6688869 your attitude should be the same as that of christ jesus
6688870 what is the business value of environmental applications and where do cad and gis fit into that

6688872 what is the business value of environmental applications and where do cad and gis fit into that
6688873 where do electrical utilities fit into sustainability and what role do geospatial technologies play
6688874 what is the business value of environmental applications and where do cad and gis fit into that
6688875 it would be no secret that we would like to see more conditionalities around the agreement

6688879 ufos have been lurking in the shadows of history for centuries surprisingly they might be a key to unraveling the human puzzle
6688880 yes that chapter to me is really the core of the book to me the whole book revolves around that chapter when i started
6688881 at that point i thought this is getting pretty wild
6688882 no longer do i call you servants for the servant does not know what his master is doing but i have called you friends for all that i have heard from my father i have made known to you
6688883 the earth is a farm we are someone elses property
6688884 human beings appear to be a slave race breeding on an isolated planet in a small galaxy as such the human race was once a source of labor for an extraterrestrial civilization and still remains a possession today to keep control over its possession and to maintain earth as something of a prison that other civilization has bred never ending conflict between human beings has promoted human spiritual decay and has erected on earth conditions of unremitting physical hardship this situation has existed for thousands of years and it continues today
6688885 reasons why u s government cant release truth about ufos

6688887 there is so much criticism in this room that reflects how biased media are on china how little they know
6688888 people do not know much about tibet and you should ask people in beijing about tibet i have friends in tibet and their living standard has improved dramatically
6688889 it is better for you to know some things before you reach a conclusion
6688890 the media want to find something to write about but you cannot do it at a cost of sacrificing the people
6688891 zardari feels that you have been misinformed and that the case that you are referring to is closed please be careful about reporting something that may have been planted
6688892 nederland heeft de afgelopen tien jaar zijn onschuld verloren als het gaat om het gooien van taarten
6688893 in anticipation of the superstars concert in the city tomorrow night
6688894 i am working as the venue general coordination on behalf of the loc and my job is to assist my fifa counterparts with the organization work
6688895 for a striker you do your job well as long as you score goals but as an organiser i can see that to make a tournament successful requires sustained hard work by fifa ioc loc and all others involved
6688896 what has impressed me most so far is that the competition was more difficult and even than in the womens world cup last year world champions germany has trouble scoring against the likes of nigeria and japan the traditional underdogs have made rapid progress and are closing in on the powerhouses
6688897 it has long been difficult for asian teams to play against the physically stronger european or american opponents but the japanese players here showed the way
6688898 despite the result i am glad to see the team has been moving in the right direction they rediscovered their fighting spirit during the campaign a legacy left by the old generation with coach shang in charge of the team they can develop back into the worlds most competitive teams
6688899 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride

6688905 its a really wonderful opportunity to get to be mentored by a lot of important people in the music industry ive been having a lot of fun with it
6688906 this was on a tuesday and the auditions were on saturday
6688907 actually a lot of them have really extensive backgrounds when it comes to performing we all do it in different ways ive done musical theatre other ones have done talent competitions
6688908 at this point weve kind of learned a couple of things but its not quite over yet
6688909 its all done by voting to actually become the next star you have to go online on ytv com
6688910 its going to be really really big its at canadas wonderland they have a big amphitheatre there we get to perform our singles live and other people who are really into the show get to watch us

6688912 am i taking for granted and abusing those things life has blessed me with
6688913 why johnny those are balloons when your mommy dies we can blow them up and shell float to heaven
6688914 in the end were all just chalk lines on the concrete drawn only to be washed away for the time that ive been given i am what i am id rather hate you for everything you are than ever love you for something you are not id rather you hate me for everything i am than have you love me for something that i cant
6688915 the obvious risk that we always think about is pregnancy but thats only one small risk of unprotected intercourse they bear the burden of the risk if they have a sexually transmitted disease
6688916 i was every kind of geek known to man dungeons amp dragons debate club model un
6688917 i also learned the tricks of heavy metal drummers how to flash the heavy metal horns on the offbeat as youre drumming or point to the hot girl in the crowd on the offbeat with your drum stick
6688918 i do think theres this tendency that these r rated comedies are trying to outdo one another with increased swearing and sexual double entendres i think ours is a little bit of a throwback
6688919 the expletives are few and far between and the situations are mature but not gratuitous
6688920 they werent afraid of writing something heartfelt and honest without being edgy for the sake of being edgy
6688921 certainly our movies not based on him but the spark of the idea maybe what happens if youre kicked out of a famous band right before they make it big
6688922 honestly it was a big adjustment all of a sudden i need just way more energy
6688923 ive always been in reaction to other people i needed to be the guy who was driving the movie fishs story is the story of the movie
6688924 usually there is a lot of competition for string positions when i took over the orchestra was really very very good it dropped a little bit the next year i was expecting a little drop this year but not so much
6688925 our first program is beethovens coriolan overture webers second clarinet concerto a contemporary piece by an american composer and we finish with edward elgars enigma variations
6688926 the question is can we pick up a few good players were doing brahmss second symphony this season and bernhard gueller is doing berliozs symphonie fantastique with us and symphony nova scotia the mandate for our orchestra is it trains musicians for studying music in higher education but the unofficial mandate is we do pieces sns cant do because of its size this becomes a problem with a smaller orchestra
6688927 the whole point of this concert is to give my support to help young musicians and to recognize people like fran and the teachers and coaches who spend their careers creating opportunities for young musicians
6688928 i moved around quite a lot when i was young
6688929 my father was with the royal bank but people from halifax know me as being from north sydney because i commuted down to halifax for lessons with john rapson and for nova scotia youth orchestra rehearsals and concerts
6688930 you win a scholarship here a scholarship there and that really helps to pay for lessons more importantly it gave me a lot of experience
6688931 i came down on various weekends throughout the year for rehearsals but it gave me a unique opportunity to do that kind of symphonic repertoire
6688932 our idea was to get it up to 150 000 in the next five years
6688933 i would be happy to donate my time and am willing to cover my expenses
6688934 i am delighted to help a worthy cause in my old stomping grounds

6688944 in anticipation of the building which was our dream we expanded 110 percent since 2003
6688945 we really are at a maximum number in our undergraduate programs
6688946 the other shortage in addition to getting new nurses out into the community is in faculty
6688947 thats really whats holding up the pipeline in nursing there arent enough faculty prepared to teach expanded numbers of students
6688948 there are so many different ways that nurses touch people and it sounds clich but its what we do
6688949 what we are talking about here is providing cures for people providing therapies for people
6688950 in this century a majority of therapies and cures will be from genetic therapy and cellular therapy and not from popping chemical compounds which is what weve done all of our lives so this is a movement forward
6688951 ik ben een getuige voor jezus niet slechts een instructeur
6688952 this really is the equivalent of a major factory opening in lansing
6688953 by this starting early people wont be as fearful and well make sure everybody gets counted
6688954 i expect the council to stand up we made that commitment to the public
6688955 we cant afford to run the golf courses we have different priorities than that
6688956 final responsibility for budget preparation presentation of the budget to the legislative body and the control of expenditures under the budget
6688957 from a city standpoint its a benefit to the area to have these courses open
6688958 we have a structural deficit in the county of 5 6 million
6688959 stuart has a well staffed department overall and its nothing personal

6689014 the differences between the two types of motors have both construction implications and mechanical environmental how the motorcycle is driven as well as construction and maintenance cost issues mechanically the two stroke engine is simple the piston with its alternating motion opens and closes the ports of the intake and exhaust from which the mixture of air petrol and oil and exhaust gases enters and leaves in comparison the four stroke motor is complex and heavier than its two stroke equivalent the upper part of the engine is the head which holds the intake and exhaust valves driven by camshafts engine power comes from petrol shot into the engine via injectors the lubrication of the two strokes engine crankshaft and connecting rods is entrusted to the fuel the power is normally governed by a carburettor that has a mechanical operation typically controlled by the depression created by the movement of the piston the lubrication of the various mechanisms of the four strokes is entrusted to oil and this can be collected in a reservoir built in the lower part of the engine called a sump which can either be a dry or wet sump depending on whether the oil is collected in a separate tank

6689026 our draft resolution is a reconfirmation of the six point agreement and theres no territorial integrity in the six principles
6689027 we believe the six principles are clear and already implemented
6689028 what we see on the ground is the result of ambiguity
6689029 we have a presence of so called russian peacekeeping forces at key georgian choke points that will control economic life it will control humanitarian activities thats why clarifications are so important
6689030 mir w re es lieber wenn die barrieren n her an der fahrbahn stehen w rden
6689031 aber mir ist nat rlich auch klar dass sicherheit sehr wichtig ist ich denke jedoch dass einige fahrer ein bisschen mehr vom gas gehen wenn die barrieren so nahe sind auf einem stadtkurs kann ein fahrer schnellster sein auch wenn er nicht das beste auto hat
6689032 ich habe das gef hl dass die strecke sicher ist sehr sicher sogar
6689033 die auslaufzonen sind sehr gro valencia ist eigentlich gar kein richtiger stadtkurs sondern eine sehr moderne strecke mit viel sicherheitsspielraum ich denke dass es auf dem formel 1 kalender sicherere strecken gibt aber auch weniger sichere die fia und die veranstalter haben einen sehr guten job gemacht
6689034 wenn ich im schnellsten auto sitzen w rde dann sicher ja denn dann kann sich alles schnell ndern aber mit unseren j ngsten leistungen wird es schwierig
6689035 wir haben den anschluss zu ferrari und mclaren verloren das macht es uns schwierig vor allem weil sogar toyota manchmal schneller ist als wir und renault ist sehr nahe dran oder auch schon manchmal schneller
6689036 ist immer gleich ich will so viele punkte wie m glich holen wenn das reicht dann fein wenn nicht dann bin ich aber auch zufrieden damit meine ziele erreicht zu haben als fahrer kannst du nur dein bestes geben aber wenn du mit dem fahrk nnen am limit bist dann geht eben nicht mehr und dass ich das von mir behaupten kann das ist mir am allerwichtigsten

6689039 it will definitely change the weekend for me because its a tragedy
6689040 all the spanish people are in shock and i am too
6689041 its probably the saddest approach to a weekend i have had
6689042 i will wear a black armband and i will talk with the other drivers tomorrow
6689043 maybe we can do something before starting maybe one minutes silence in the pit lane
6689044 tomorrow we will start slowly to get into the weekend life continues but its a different weekend compared to what it should be
6689045 yes for me i would definitely be looking forward to doing that
6689046 i just want to send out my heartfelt thoughts and best wishes to all the families and to all the people in spain
6689047 i think its a tragedy i was really sad to hear it had happened
6689048 i just hope that doesnt stall our weekend i hope we are able to move on and do the country proud
6689049 i think last year we had a similar accident in brazil and it was a disaster it was so sad
6689050 as lewis said i give 100 percent support to the people because we are here for sport and there are so many important things apart from sport which are the lives of these people and its a very sad moment
6689051 i think all of us need to do everything we can to help these people

6689054 when abhinav fired the first shot in the sighting time practice time it hit the target between the fourth and fifth rings
6689055 it is unthinkable of any shooter competing at this level to score 4 5 points but he remained calm and corrected the angle of his sight and the end result is in front of you
6689056 actually you cannot blame anyone for its your duty to take care of your gun he was the only indian to qualify so there were shooters only from other countries in that room

6689073 or find a sponsor or maybe even charge for it
6689074 its with a great big sad face that i write to you all as of last week myself lucy blakeley keyboard and owen cox drums decided to split up the band there are lots of little reasons why which it would be a bit pointless to explain as they all lead towards the same conclusion were all going to be doing different things as of now unfortunately not all of us will be doing musical things ill be lending guitar skills to my good friends 28 costumes for basically as long as theyll have me or until musically im no longer an eligible bachelor
6689075 its totally inspiring as a guitar player because theyre my favourite band that ive heard in a long time and im still a fan you know i think its important to nurture that and think like a fan and its not always easy to think like a fan you have to really genuinely like band when i got into the cribs second record i was just really excited because they were a band that i could be a fan of and i get to be in a band that im a real fan of so thats fantastic just from a musical point of view
6689076 what weve done so far people whove heard it say it sounds very much like the smiths mashed with the cribs and thats obviously quite an exciting prospect for some people but its not really enough for us that we want it to be the next version of the cribs one of the things i liked about the band before i even met them was that they sounded like achievers really almost like over achievers i just heard one track and hoped that everything else was as good as that
6689077 we want it to be more than the sum of its parts the sum of its parts is the cribs and the smiths it bares both genes but you wanna be more than the sum of its parts were kinda putting this record to bed now its just the right time for this to finish i think were just getting started with johnny so its kinda frustrating its been like 20 months which is a long time and its taken us far away
6689078 i knew what kind of music i wanted make but at first i found it hard to get these conflicting desires to blend well outside of my head id been making these weird remix mashups for my occasional djing so i thought ill take the method ive been using for that but use it for song writing instead the very first thing i tried was hypntz
6689079 with my history with music this track just started to seem more and more like the perfect opening salvo it really wipes the slate clean but simultaneously shows very dramatically where it is im going
6689080 the wolf shall live with the lamb the leopard shall lie down with the kid
6689081 we thought it would be a useful experiment to see what we could do to reduce the carbon emissions associated with releasing a record
6689082 when i mentioned the idea to the wave pictures they asked if they could be the ones to do it and suggested they could walk to the studio from their house
6689083 we are really pleased that moshi moshi is taking these positive steps towards reducing the carbon impact of their latest release their studio of choice is solar powered they are reducing the impact of their travel and have taken account of the recommendations of our first step report into the uk music industry greenhouse gas emissions environmental change institute oxford university 2008 its this kind of intelligent response to the issue that is going to ultimately catalyze the changes to a low carbon music business that we all need so badly
6689084 we feel that this is not a drug that failed to meet its clinical endpoints the company did fail to provide a proper train of documentation which would allow the agency to accept this filing
6689085 in order for your application to be considered complete you were informed during the meeting of aug 11 2000 in our letter of jan 19 2001 and during the telephone conference call of jan 26 2001 that the application must provide evidence that the addition of a toxic agent irinotecan cpt 11 is necessary to achieve the clinical effect
6689086 having agreed to the design execution and analyses proposed in protocols reviewed under this process i e carcinogenicity protocols stability protocols and phase 3 protocols for clinical trials that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim the agency will not later alter its perspective on the issues of design execution or analyses unless public health concerns unrecognized at the time of protocol assessment under this process are evident
6689087 neverender came about because the band wanted to celebrate the end of the coheed and cambria saga in a special way
6689088 we wanted to come up with an idea that paid proper respect to this phase of our career while at the same time gave our fans something truly unique and different many of these songs have never been played in front of an audience before so i think were going to be freaking out at the same time our fans are its going to be a major challenge were psyched our fans have been so loyal and amazing we figured they deserved this
6689089 were really looking forward to going deep and revisiting not only the songs but also the story
6689090 interestingly enough us going over all the old material seems to be influencing our writing of the next record which were sort of doing simultaneously and to me that seems appropro since the next story is the prequel to the amory wars

6689097 i dont want anything to do with this industry it absolutely stinks im gonna go out having told the truth and with my head held high and having stood for something i feel like a sore thumb in a piranha pool in this industry i dont like the way its all run by rich men in their 50s who went to private school its not something i want to be part of you get these bands who have a few hits say like the pigeon detectives who come out with another album trying to do the same thing again im going to make a record thats truly artistic which is the reverend and the makers album thats artistically interesting then im going to retire and become a pedal taxi driver
6689098 its all done for profit and not for any degree of musical feeling or sentiment and the press distort things to such a degree that youve not got a hope of knowing what the truth is so its not something that i want to participate in or fuel anymore it makes me tired and it makes me feel ill and i dont want anything more to do with it
6689099 the song die tonight live forever came about at a strange time for us early on in the bands timeline where we had all just moved in together had just signed our indie deal in the us with stolen transmission and were spending all our time programming writing and recording
6689100 weve always loved videos that walk that edge where people dont quite feel ok with it smack my bitch up rabbit in your headlights closer 99 problems fuck anything chris cunninghams ever done for that matter these are the kind of videos that we ultimately aspire to make the unfortunate reality is that for a new band unless you make your own videos on camcorders labels just wont let you push that envelope anymore big budget videos with artistic statements for new artists simply dont happen unless you make them yourself you have to be the quirky band on treadmills making youtube work for you its sad really it feels like great videos are still out there theyre definitely innovating using digital technology but the days of the big budget creative video are dwindling personally i dont feel like this video comes close to those videos but it does have this certain indie film vibe to it that i really love we really hope that by doing these videos on shoestrings we can grow into making the kind of videos that we grew up idolizing
6689101 last year was really special the whole tour received such an energetic and positive reaction culminating in the memorable finale at bestival undoubtedly one of the highlights of 2007 for me and the perfect way to top off the summer given the success of last year and the anticipation thats built up towards this years dates 2008 could be even better needless to say that im very much looking forward to playing bestival again

6689321 quantum of solace is a seamless continuation of the storyline that began with the last film we believe november 14th is a great date that allows us to play straight through thanksgiving and right into christmas the bond films have a long history of entertaining audiences in this holiday corridor going back to goldeneye in 1995 the studio enjoyed tremendous success opening casino royale in north america on november 17 2006 and we believe this decision will give the public a wider opportunity to see the film over the holiday

6689334 you got the message across and you didnt sound too offensive
6689335 but in this field id say that every real estate agent is my competition
6689336 having a partnership is great and with a team there is definitely more efficiency each one of us has our own strengths and weaknesses and it balances out with that we are able to put out a better product
6689337 i wanted to pursue both brendon and kevin because they had strong business skills immediately after brendon began working here i saw early successes in home sales
6689338 after brendon got his toes in the water it helped encouraged his brother kevin to join the team
6689339 coldwell banker makes sure that agents receive continuous training to refresh their skills we work as a team where our new agents go through an intensive training process and even our experienced agents go through ongoing training
6689340 i havent been in school for so long and it feels really weird going back to school after all these years
6689341 rick made a huge difference in my working at coldwell i wanted to work with someone who knew what he was doing and rick knew what he was doing
6689342 i like working in a team that pushes you to the next level
6689343 the markets really good inventory has definitely come down a little bit and the prices have remained stable in a lot of the areas it really is neighborhood specific here in san francisco
6689344 the biggest challenge is educating my clients to what the state of the market is especially with the bad press and whats going on with interest rates i think of how i can help negotiate them with the highest possible price of the listing for sellers and the best possible price for the buyers
6689345 this person is really specific about what he wants i know he wont go over his price range but im just going to show him the property and see what he thinks
6689346 that is my way of saying thank you to my clients and showing them that i appreciate their business
6689347 for me its not about selling homes its really about putting people into homes that match their lifestyles and finding a home that meets their needs i try to do that in a nonthreatening open manner so that my clients never feel any pressure from me to buy or sell a home when they are not ready to
6689348 i think its pretty important for this crew as far as looking to take a step up or a step forward
6689349 so far throughout the season i think we have made progression and improved
6689350 obviously we were pretty disappointed as a group how we went in auckland so for us its a good opportunity to prove to ourselves and obviously to everyone else that we have taken a step forward
6689351 im very hopeful we can show that we can do that
6689352 i think thats a good thing theres a lot less baggage amongst this crew at the moment
6689353 we possibly saw that in our first match against the all blacks a 34 19 win a while back and hopefully we can see that over the next few matches
6689354 when someones talking youre getting a lot of eyes directed straight at you and intensity as far as contests at training
6689355 thats a good thing and weve just got the positive mindset to put ourselves under as much pressure as you can at training and to execute under those pressures
6689356 theyre a side that have the world champion tag so theres still an underlying confidence with that
6689357 it wasnt too long back when they secured that amazing 32 30 victory in dunedin
6689358 i think south africa are an extremely proud nation and especially at home we are expecting a significant battle in front of us on saturday
6689359 when you play at even newlands and especially at joburg and pretoria those venues theyre on top of you and its like a cauldron and the crowd can be at times quite hostile
6689360 whereas at kings park absa stadium theres still a massive crowd but they dont feel as though theyre suffocating you
6689361 it was a long time ago and ive got great memories about that whole trip that whole era really
6689362 so now its hopefully time to implant some new ones
6689363 frankly i think pearce has got even more speed and power than colm
6689364 compared to any of our players hes got great speed and carry and a really good ability to carry the footy
6689365 so thats one of the qualities that is very hard to find and its what were very pleased with
6689366 hes been very impressive i saw him kick for the first time in november when he turned up from ireland and he kicked the ball very well straight away so i thought thats a tick
6689367 we put him into one of the pre season games down in melbourne and he did okay and hes done extremely well at reserve level weve been very impressed with him
6689368 hes got a bit of size and hes got some speed and power and his ball skills are good and he seems to do it well
6689369 it will be one more player who can genuinely carry the footy he will not get caught from behind
6689370 oh it didnt hurt chicago new york or los angeles
6689371 no but if you go to the front desk they will tell you your name
6689372 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6689373 i cannot express the words to say how much i miss kathy and greg in my life
6689374 the aircraft drifted to the edge of the runway but it was only for a short time and it quickly corrected as normal
6689375 it is one of those things ive been used to in the past
6689376 at a test level i look back at when i first had my debut run on in 2000 there was probably about four or five months between playing football
6689377 thats the nature of what weve got in australian rugby not much football between test and super 14 football
6689378 and again last year at the world cup there wasnt much football before then
6689379 it is something i have a lot of experience with so its not too much of a concern
6689380 i feel physically very good i have been training well and obviously been involved with the test team for the last eight or nine weeks
6689381 he probably wasnt that hopeful through super rugby that he was going to get any more international rugby
6689382 hes a really good team man and hes a bloke whos been around for a while
6689383 hes experienced and hes obviously really going to relish getting the opportunity to start a test match again and theres a window of opportunity for him and reserve brett sheehan now
6689384 i said earlier in the year i was surprised to be a part of the squad given the fact i am heading overseas my age and a lot of those factors
6689385 its been great to be involved again the opportunity has presented itself to start and thats a great feeling
6689386 probably some of that criticism was well justified years ago so were just working hard at the moment and over the last two years to rectify that
6689387 during the tri nations and i havent played a lot of it but our scrum has been going well not great but fairly well
6689388 i was surprised i got a run now i have to go out there and perform
6689389 do you know who i am i can make cool aid

6689417 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6689418 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6689419 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6689420 anfall mot en medlem skall betraktas som en attack p alla
6689421 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6689422 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6689423 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6689424 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6689425 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6689426 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6689427 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6689428 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6689429 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6689430 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6689431 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6689432 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6689433 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6689434 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6689435 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6689436 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6689437 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6689438 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6689439 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6689440 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6689441 who are open to doing something on the production side
6689442 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6689443 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6689444 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6689445 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6689446 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6689447 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6689448 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6689449 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6689450 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6689451 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6689452 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6689453 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6689454 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6689455 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6689456 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6689457 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6689458 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6689459 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6689460 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6689461 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6689462 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6689463 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6689464 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6689465 imate einsteina imate isaaca newtona imate bethoveena imate usaina bolta nemogu e je objasniti kako i to oni to rade

6689467 ovo je udo odu evljen sam odigrali smo sjajno cijeli turnir i ostvarili smo veliki uspjeh
6689468 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6689469 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6689470 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6689471 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6689472 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6689473 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6689474 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6689475 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6689476 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6689477 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6689478 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6689479 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6689480 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6689481 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6689482 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6689483 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6689484 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6689485 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6689486 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6689487 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6689488 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6689489 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6689490 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6689491 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6689492 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6689493 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6689494 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6689495 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6689496 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6689497 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6689498 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6689499 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6689500 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6689501 there was some shell damage to buildings plus signs of widespread looting
6689502 there is an urgent need to provide people with food now we are particularly concerned about the people living in villages to the north of gori town
6689503 we have ordered in education and recreation kits to supply 40 000 displaced children
6689504 closely guarded secrets discussed in board rooms but beyond the reach of patients whose lives are on the line
6689505 now anyone with access to a computer can directly compare a local hospital with the one across town to see how it stacks up against the biggest medical institutions nationwide
6689506 relentless criticism that its so called death list didnt give adequate weight to a hospitals mix of patients including how sick poor or old they were
6689507 tougher for a hospital to game the system by shipping risky cases somewhere else
6689508 there are very few drugs with strong evidence of effectiveness in treating trigeminal neuralgia
6689509 if people fail to respond to these drugs physicians should not be reluctant to consider referring the patient for surgery often surgery is considered a last resort and patients suffer while the well intentioned physician tries other medications with limited effectiveness
6689510 if patients dont respond well to carbamazepine or one or two other drugs it is reasonable to consider surgery that targets the root of the trigeminal nerve
6689511 people with trigeminal neuralgia should be aware of the availability of surgical treatments and discuss these options with their physicians
6689512 west africas annual floods bring with them not only the threat of vector borne and communicable diseases but it further endangers the lives of people already malnourished by the food price crisis
6689513 massage is helpful in the short term but the alexander techniqueretained effectiveness at one year the results should apply to mostpatients with chronic or recurrent back pain
6689514 exercise therapy significantlyreduces pain and improves function in adults with chronic low backpain particularly in patients visiting primary care providers becauseof back pain
6689515 we welcome many of the reports recommendations believe and truly believe that this consultation document is a timely contribution to the debate about the future of maternity services in the east of england the college agrees with the premise that healthcare in the region needs to change and nowhere is this more relevant than in relation to maternity and newborn care
6689516 faced with a rising birth rate and an increase in more complex births it is a gross understatement to say that 160 midwives are needed with an emerging baby boom we need at a conservative estimate at least 610 more midwives in the region
6689517 we welcomed many of the reports other recommendations and proposals such as for postnatal services but some of the proposals are vague and further consideration is needed in respect of the level of support given to women and their families
6689518 how can we expect midwives to cope when we are in the midst of a baby boom and their workload is racing ahead of staff numbers
6689519 the government in february has made a commitment to providing 4 000 new midwives the equivalent of 3 400 full time midwives across the country by 2012 we also need trusts in the region to make maternity services a priority so that mothers and babies get the service they need and deserve morale among midwives is low we want to see midwives valued and cherished and rewarded in their pay packet for their skill and dedication the challenge for the trusts in this region is to make maternity services a priority and show that maternity services really do matter

6689525 all of his bodily functions went down so they have to build them up again
6689526 hes also got a fungal infection on his skin but its got into his blood supply and poisoned his blood
6689527 he was bleeding in the stomach and had to have a bit of an operation last week so as long as this sort of thing is going on hes still in a critical condition
6689528 he used to have a plump round face and its a gaunt looking face now
6689529 he asked me are the lions in the top eight so i got that bit
6689530 hes faced danger on a number of occasions but hes never been in trouble like this before

6689548 de presidentsverkiezing zal plaatsvinden op 6 september de kandidaturen mogen ingediend worden vanaf 26 augustus
6689549 it involves people of all ages and abilities and addresses the needs of those who are socially excluded
6689550 it is a positive scheme for communities as it strengthens their cultural and linguistic identities and enables them to experience performances of all music
6689551 the south wales valleys have a rich tradition of music making much of it fostered and inspired by the churches and chapels that have been the focus of community life for generations the christian life is often described as a journey where we travel in heart and mind towards a deeper knowledge of the god who draws us to himself it is therefore appropriate in our journey to this great christian shrine to have brought with us something of our culture to celebrate and offer in thanksgiving and praise
6689552 i understand that were about to reach a final agreement which is what we want
6689553 i have lived in america since 1980 and i dont like the fact that i cant vote im gonna register to vote
6689554 im republican and im casting my vote for john mccain for president
6689555 as you know we allowed people to vote on which character they most wanted to see in the console version and cammy won so shes definitely in the game
6689556 we have a rough version of her already up and running akuma came in second or third and weve already included him in the arcade game
6689557 most important is that the vaccine has been successfully used in human clinical trials
6689558 it is a huge investment by a company to gamble that they will make it through clinical trials
6689559 it is going to take some innovative methods to generate that kind of product
6689560 it is going to be a challenge to have that kind of individuality and to make sure you produce it the same way to pass the fdas review
6689561 what i like about it is its got a hidden agenda it looks as if its about listening and joining with allies except the idea here which mccain cant say but i can is to essentially kill the un nobodys going to walk out of the un theres a lot of emotional attachment to it in the us how do you kill it you create a parallel institution
6689562 insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result
6689563 conservatives are not necessarily stupid but most stupid people are conservatives
6689564 whether or not it will be sustained i guess it really depends on what rhetoric we get from russia in the days ahead i believe its possible we may go on further from here
6689565 there seems to be a bit of a return to favour commodities again in the last couple of days i think the physical buying has helped to support it as well
6689566 i personally think platinum prices have reached their bottom but at this moment i couldnt confirm if automobile companies have started to buy
6689567 we could reconsider our decisions on sending kazak oil to the world market changing the export route is in our agenda now
6689568 there is some 50 million tons of oil there and it is unknown how this will be transported to world markets
6689569 every decent man is ashamed of the government he lives under
6689570 what we have put together is a kind of one stop shopping opportunity for customers to install solar systems with no out of pocket expenses
6689571 certainly with this interest rate there will be opportunities for customers to save money on a monthly basis
6689572 our goal is to achieve or exceed compliance with the requirement
6689573 in the past weve had finance entities weve worked with but we have referred customers to those entities and they would negotiate rates
6689574 that will be the big trigger point if this thing is going to be a success
6689575 aps is doing what i as an installer think should be done to get things moving forward
6689576 aps has gone from being not very progressive in their rebates to being one of the best in the country in the last six months
6689577 but do most people do it for that reason no
6689578 what you can do is lock your utility rate in for the next 30 years or so
6689579 obviously we want to look at the interest rates and fine print in the contracts
6689580 assuming its reasonable this opens the door to a lot of people without a program where this can be financed youre leaving it to just the most wealthy people to take advantage
6689581 within the past five to six years muslims have been falsely accused of many things in this country
6689582 i heard them raising money in the mosque in phoenix when i arrived here in 2000 they came from dallas and said they were raising money for families in the occupied territories
6689583 she changed her mind and does not wish to pursue charges against robert the listed suspect in this case
6689584 i guess if you think that being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong
6689585 but if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6689586 i understand that senator mccain was asked yesterday this question how many houses do you own and he couldnt answer that question
6689587 he couldnt count high enough apparently to even know how many houses he owns
6689588 for all practical purposes military to military cooperation had really already been suspended with the russians
6689589 nato cancelled some exercises and i cant imagine a circumstance right now that we would engage in military cooperation with the russians until the situation in georgia is resolved
6689590 there has not been much evidence of any significant russian withdrawals
6689591 russia is in violation of the commitments that they have made
6689592 what we know is accurate is that the withdrawal is not happening very quickly if it in fact has begun
6689593 the withdrawal needs to take place and needs to take place now
6689594 a lot of russian forces are moving around but not moving out
6689595 however russia needs to make a choice about whether it wants to be a part of international institutions and we certainly hope that russia will make that strategic choice

6689606 stamp out as many typos as we can find in public signage and other venues where innocent eyes may be befouled by vile stains on the delicate fabric of our language
6689607 and discovered a hand rendered sign inside that i regret to report had a few errors i know today was supposed to be my day off from typo hunting but if i may be permitted to quote that most revered of android law enforcers inspector gadget always on duty i cant shut it off will we never be free from the shackles of apostrophic misunderstanding even in a place surrounded by natural beauty
6689608 i was reluctant to disfigure the sign any further so we had to let the other typo stand still i think i shall be haunted by that perversity
6689609 i write i also edit perhaps i could be of some service to you

6689616 its an incredible feeling to be olympic champion its been a long time coming it was a fantastic race probably the most enjoyable race i have ever had and i am really pleased not just for me but for my coach friends and family who have given me so much support
6689617 i am in an olympic final the dream is coming true darren is horrible to fight he has so much raw strength but i got through it because my training was spot on
6689618 re 0426 to save months of detailed investigation simply ask the chinese gymnasts to quickly say what year they were born
6689619 if he beats sutherland i think james degale can go on to win the gold the lads have shown great mental strength to get through and lets hope they can do even better than bronzes
6689620 i have an olympics related quiz from work and one of the questions is in which sport would you not be allowed to compete with a beard any ideas
6689621 without taking anything away from tom daley why should a 14 year old be allowed to compete in one event when there are controversies regarding 16 year olds in gymnastics
6689622 look out for little tom daley in the diving later get us a gold for devon me lover
6689623 ukrainian super heavyweight vyacheslav glazkov has pulled out of his semi final bout because of an elbow injury chinese zhang zhilei will move to the final by walkover and meet the winner of the other semi final between britains david price and italian roberto cammarelle
6689624 the sand sticks to mens bodies in beach volleyball because of the body figure men are all muscles and hair while the women are curvy also the skin type matters as most men have rough skin compared to women plus it rained yesterday in beijing so the sand was wet meaning the lift wasnt there for the sand to stick
6689625 pardon our ignorance but why is one player on each of the volleyball teams wearing a different colour strip
6689626 that player is the libero the defensive player responsible for digging up shots and setting up counter attacks
6689627 love competition love risking your pride love winning it back love giving it everything youve got love the glory love the pain love sport even when it breaks your heart
6689628 interestingly sand does stick to the mens bodies whereas it didnt stick to the women last night anyone have any answers
6689629 your gb vs the russians article doesnt mention the boxing have we any golden moments possible in the square ring
6689630 before the games i said id stake my mortgage on ben ainslie winning gold chris boardman olympic gold medallist said hed stake his mortgage on shanaze reade winning gold look whos got a roof over their heads now
6689631 just to depress everyone even more bmx replaced the mens 1km time trial and the womens 500m time trial wed have probably won two more golds in those events with chris hoy and victoria pendleton
6689632 i just caught the back wheel of chausson and went over but i put everything into this race ive fallen off and got back up ive fallen off and got back up i gave it my heart and everything but today it wasnt good enough
6689633 i gave it the best shot i had and i didnt have any more
6689634 im only 19 theres so much more to come from me as an athlete i feel like i might not want to see my bike for a while
6689635 im hurting i think i might have broken my hand im hurting between my legs and im cut all over
6689636 we are trying to push the players to use skirts and also nicer shirts not the shirts that are made for men but ones with more curves
6689637 gutted i think everyone built that bmx gold up way too much we need to give our athletes a bit of breathing space
6689638 the silver and bronze wouldnt have felt great in my opinion might as well risk it
6689639 those georgian volleyball players expose the mockery of grouping athletes by country its meaningless why do we feel the need athletes should be funded at a club level and compete in the olympics as individuals
6689640 imagine the start chris hoy would get on a bmx
6689641 what would the five events be in the 21st century pentathlon i reckon bmx table tennis kayaking wrestling and abseiling
6689642 any chance of another 10k open swim tonight perhaps a team tag race would be interesting
6689643 bmx riding at this level is not for the faint hearted is it
6689644 i reckon shanaze was taking that deliberately slow to build some confidence and get some decent points on the board i can see her going for it in the final race
6689645 that bmx course reminds me of mario kart they should be allowed shells and power ups dont you think
6689646 if you had told me before the games that gb would be fourth at the end i would have been celebrating theres no shame in coming fourth behind china the us and russia
6689647 surely this bmx course design needs rethinking the first bend is so tight that its just asking for trouble
6689648 its like the wicket on the final day of a test match i can see some cracks appearing
6689649 falling in your first ride doesnt do much for your mental strength bmx can be unpredictable and that race was but mum if youre watching at home im fine and safe
6689650 look out for irelands jamie costin in the 50km walk days before athens he was involved in a horrific car crash and broke his back in two places it was feared he would never walk again yet here he is a true story of what the olympics are all about

6689652 chelsea has an abundance of good players that can be a huge strength because the champions league and the premier league is a marathon but if it doesnt go well it can also be a weakness
6689653 there are so many players in midfield that they will have to sacrifice very good and very experienced players they cant all play at once
6689654 for a long time i thought that they had made up their mind that they would lose lampard and thats why they bought deco
6689655 hes beaten me four times before and hes strong his raw strength is horrible
6689656 john does know this character faisal but theyre not best mates theres definitely something going on but its been pased to johns lawyers

6689660 i am very excited that if we get it right cornubia will provide the first real opportunity to build a city based on the principles underpinning our constitution and not those which defined our apartheid past

6689669 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
6689670 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
6689671 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
6689672 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
6689673 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
6689674 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
6689675 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
6689676 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
6689677 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
6689678 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
6689679 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
6689680 its come back from a level that was grossly overvalued to one that is becoming sensible there is further to go
6689681 we are aware of several bugs and we are working on it to get out a solution within a month or two

6689687 initially scanning electron microscopy sem conducted at another laboratory showed high silicon and oxygen signals that led them to conclude that the spores were a weaponized form says kotula
6689688 the possible misinterpretation of the sem results arose because microanalysis in the sem is not a surface sensitive tool
6689689 because a spore body can be 1 5 to 2 microns wide by 1 micron long a sem cannot localize the elemental signal from whole spore bodies
6689690 lacked that fuzzy outer coating that would indicate that theyd been weaponized
6689691 we might over and above all this add to what man acquires in the civil state moral liberty which alone makes him truly master of himself for the mere impulse of appetite is slavery while obedience to a law which we prescribe to ourselves is liberty

6689710 all of his bodily functions went down so they have to build them up again
6689711 hes also got a fungal infection on his skin but its got into his blood supply and poisoned his blood
6689712 he was bleeding in the stomach and had to have a bit of an operation last week so as long as this sort of thing is going on hes still in a critical condition
6689713 he used to have a plump round face and its a gaunt looking face now
6689714 he asked me are the lions in the top eight so i got that bit
6689715 hes faced danger on a number of occasions but hes never been in trouble like this before
6689716 we have 45 pupils this year in p7 and expect 20 to pass in grade one pupils no longer miss classes do not doze in the afternoon and performance has improved tremendously
6689717 we are going to bring internet to schools so that children and the communities are able to access what is happening in other parts of the world
6689718 expulsion would at least serve the purpose of sparing these two victims the trauma
6689719 they need to speak to the masses for this to be realised there is a need for intellectuals to ensure that they do not become servants of the dominant elites
6689720 we often go to the communities to collect data and once our research is completed we come back to our comfort zones and invent solutions that have no relevance to the people
6689721 very often no tangible benefits accrue to the very people whom we are talking about in our publications this cannot be the kind of development and social justice that we are aspiring for
6689722 we cannot sit in our air conditioned rooms and think that we can craft policies that will benefit the society when we have never interacted with them
6689723 that will be patronising it will also reflect our lack of respect for the people that we claim to speak for
6689724 it often calls for personal sacrifice for intellectuals to articulate the needs of the ordinary people
6689725 this is often visible in such fora like the media such intolerance only serves to create a negative image of intellectuals within the community
6689726 we continue to see africa suffering from this brain drain some of the notable scholars who continue to receive world recognition come from africa
6689727 yet these intellectuals do not operate in africa but in the western world
6689728 we accept that africa will continue to lag behind in development unless something is done to retain its intellectual capital on this continent
6689729 tasmanias certainly added an element to the competition as far as travelling and you know its been a unique addition to the vfl
6689730 getting in the afl was outstanding because we wouldnt have been able to play in a grand final unless we did it but mark williams and the players leading us to that grand final winning best footy game ive ever ever been at
6689731 weve had top spot for a little bit and australia have taken it back
6689732 it has been because of the success weve had around the world for the past couple of years its reward for that and we really want to improve our game
6689733 i would like to think if we had been playing a fair amount of one day cricket coming into the series everything would roll smoothly
6689734 our battle is to get into the series in the first couple of games to get our standards up to the level we know we are capable of
6689735 we are pretty undercooked considering the cricket we have played
6689736 we are favourites in terms of what we have achieved over a period of time and that is fair enough but as a team our feet are firmly on the ground in terms of what we need to do to be successful here
6689737 it has been very difficult to maintain the levels the last week and a bit has been very slow and more mentally draining rather than anything else trying to find things to do
6689738 it is fair to say the guys are thinking a bit about home but there are battles still ahead
6689739 we are waiting to find out we are hoping like england that the right decision is made
6689740 the rough thing for all teams is that we are so close to a major tournament and no one knows what is going on
6689741 it is probably not looking good for him at the moment
6689742 i guess we will have to see where he is by the weekend and see whether or not he will progress
6689743 if not we might have to look at someone else if he is not going to get any better we might have to act but he is in the hands of the physio at the moment

6689749 following a strenuous investigation conducted over the past weeks three haredi men suspected of hooliganism attacks and vandalism were arrested and brought before the court for a remand hearing
6689750 the court extended their remand and the police plan to recommend that they be charged with severe violations and belonging to an illegal organization harassing some of the haredi community members whose conduct is not to the liking of the chastity squad thugs
6689751 on june 1 2008 at around 10 45 pm the defendant arrived with six other people at the complainants home armed with a bat and tear gas
6689752 the defendant and the others also tied a piece of cloth to the complainants mouth and warned her that should she open her eyes they would spray tear gas into them
6689753 at the end of the incident the defendant or one of the others told the complainant that she must leave her apartment otherwise this will only be the beginning and that if she remained there she would be murdered

6689759 the goal of morpheme has always been to streamline the animation production pipeline offering faster development times and higher fidelity
6689760 we selected nvidias physx technology because out of all commercial physics engines it offers the highest character grade fidelity an essential requirement for creating believable characters
6689761 naturalmotions technology marks a turning point in gaming its fidelity of movement makes characters seem so real that you want to touch them and the physx integration lets you do just that

6689764 in viz medias naruto animation series running on cartoon network the anbu only played a parallel and unexamined role in the original storyline
6689765 we were fascinated with the concept of the anbu who are different from regular ninja in the naruto universe and created a new story around them
6689766 i know that there are some expectations to do something before the end of the year
6689767 bridge gaps that maybe its premature to bridge or to reach something which is not the comprehensive agreement that we want to reach
6689768 the pressure the international pressure this can lead to clashes this can lead to misunderstandings this can lead to violence as we had as we faced after camp david 2000 and the circumstances in a way are similar
6689769 what is more important is the content and the nature of the understanding
6689770 it is one of those things ive been used to in the past
6689771 at a test level i look back at when i first had my debut run on in 2000 there was probably about four or five months between playing football
6689772 thats the nature of what weve got in australian rugby not much football between test and super 14 football
6689773 and again last year at the world cup there wasnt much football before then
6689774 it is something i have a lot of experience with so its not too much of a concern
6689775 i feel physically very good i have been training well and obviously been involved with the test team for the last eight or nine weeks
6689776 he probably wasnt that hopeful through super rugby that he was going to get any more international rugby
6689777 hes a really good team man and hes a bloke whos been around for a while
6689778 hes experienced and hes obviously really going to relish getting the opportunity to start a test match again and theres a window of opportunity for him and reserve brett sheehan now
6689779 i said earlier in the year i was surprised to be a part of the squad given the fact i am heading overseas my age and a lot of those factors
6689780 its been great to be involved again the opportunity has presented itself to start and thats a great feeling
6689781 probably some of that criticism was well justified years ago so were just working hard at the moment and over the last two years to rectify that
6689782 during the tri nations and i havent played a lot of it but our scrum has been going well
6689783 frankly i think pearce has got even more speed and power than colm
6689784 compared to any of our players hes got great speed and carry and a really good ability to carry the footy
6689785 so thats one of the qualities that is very hard to find and its what were very pleased with
6689786 hes been very impressive i saw him kick for the first time in november when he turned up from ireland and he kicked the ball very well straight away so i thought thats a tick
6689787 we put him into one of the pre season games down in melbourne and he did okay and hes done extremely well at reserve level weve been very impressed with him
6689788 hes got a bit of size and hes got some speed and power and his ball skills are good and he seems to do it well
6689789 it will be one more player who can genuinely carry the footy he will not get caught from behind
6689790 coaching is a profession of love you cannot coach people unless you love them
6689791 i think its pretty important for this crew as far as looking to take a step up or a step forward
6689792 so far throughout the season i think we have made progression and improved
6689793 obviously we were pretty disappointed as a group how we went in auckland so for us its a good opportunity to prove to ourselves and obviously to everyone else that we have taken a step forward
6689794 im very hopeful we can show that we can do that
6689795 i think thats a good thing theres a lot less baggage amongst this crew at the moment
6689796 we possibly saw that in our first match against the all blacks a 34 19 win a while back and hopefully we can see that over the next few matches
6689797 when someones talking youre getting a lot of eyes directed straight at you and intensity as far as contests at training
6689798 thats a good thing and weve just got the positive mindset to put ourselves under as much pressure as you can at training and to execute under those pressures
6689799 theyre a side that have the world champion tag so theres still an underlying confidence with that
6689800 it wasnt too long back when they secured that amazing 32 30 victory in dunedin
6689801 i think south africa are an extremely proud nation and especially at home we are expecting a significant battle in front of us on saturday
6689802 when you play at even newlands and especially at joburg and pretoria those venues theyre on top of you and its like a cauldron and the crowd can be at times quite hostile
6689803 whereas at kings park absa stadium theres still a massive crowd but they dont feel as though theyre suffocating you
6689804 it was a long time ago and ive got great memories about that whole trip that whole era really
6689805 so now its hopefully time to implant some new ones
