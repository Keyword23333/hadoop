9150111 i saw lots of chinese people standing outside stadiums on the wrong part of a perimeter fence as observers rather than participants
9150112 we must reverse that trend and make sure our olympics are more accessible i also want to minimise the number of empty seats in the stadiums which frustrate the public and keep them at a distance for no reason and i want our volunteers to be trained better and given a more clearly defined role
9150113 i think we came out a little lackadaisical we looked it on the opening kickoff and missed some tackles
9150114 but then we kind of shored things up and played better we had a really good second half
9150115 and were trying to get to where they are tonight wasnt as much about the score but about the effort weve just got to put this past us and get ready for wakefield well start that monday morning

9150130 contador es el claro favorito por su calidad experiencia motivaci n y equipo y adem s ha tenido tiempo para preparar la vuelta con m s tranquilidad eso es una ventaja importante
9150131 contador fue al giro sin prepararlo y lo gan la vuelta la ha preparado a conciencia y por lo tanto tiene m s ventaja que los dem s ha estudiado las etapas de asturias y pirineos ha realizado concentraciones llega fresco
9150132 estoy un poco cansado y les dejo a alberto y carlos la responsabilidad porque no s si mi motor empezar a griparse me centrar en las etapas hay que ser realista ahora mismo no estoy mal aunque no he descansado mucho y es la primera vez que hago dos grandes seguidas hasta el primer d a de monta a no se ver si estoy para disputar la vuelta o no

9150164 ja das war ein film eine literaturverfilmung der gr ne heinrich und mir hat das am anfang gar nicht so wahnsinnig viel spa gemacht weil es alles so fremd war und so neu und irgendwie irritierend und ich glaube das ist manchmal ein ganz wesentlicher aspekt dass so neues und befremdendes erst mal nicht so toll ist und dass man eigentlich erst wenn man etwas mehr mit den mitteln umgehen kann und es etwas besser versteht auch genie en kann und mittlerweile mache ich es fast lieber als theater
9150165 bei mir ging das los mit nichts bereuen und mit dem wei en rauschen und ich glaube beide filme waren nominiert oder haben auch den first step award gewonnen wenn ich mich richtig entsinne deshalb ist das ein ganz wichtiger preis f r mich gewesen und ich verfolge das auch nach wie vor weil ich als schauspieler nat rlich auch daran interessiert bin zu kucken mit wem ich in zukunft arbeiten werde
9150166 wie oft gibts filme die wirklich toll sind gerade vom nachwuchs der einfach leider untergeht aus was f r gr nden auch immer und deshalb finde ich es so toll dass da filme gerade so im anfang unterst tzt werden und denen geholfen werden dass die gesehen werden und dass sie auszeichnungen bekommen die dann doch viel bedeuten und eben dadurch weiter gef rdert werden das finde ich gro artig
9150167 alles was nicht so kompliziert ist weil ich hasse es diese ganzen bedienungsanleitungen zu lesen das h lt einfach immer alles wahnsinnig auf und ich mag einfach die sachen die man anmacht und die sachen erkl ren sich von selbst
9150168 ich finde technik ist ne tolle sache ich bertreibe es nicht also ich schreibe nach wie vor gerne per hand meine termine irgendwo auf und ich habe das lteste handy das man sich vorstellen kann mit dem man nur telefonieren und nicht fotografieren kann

9150194 its interesting that we have scored two late goals away rather than at home
9150195 maybe thats the players not feeling the anxiety around the ground so much when you are away from home if you are not 1 0 or 2 0 up after half an hour there are a few frustrated comments and i understand that
9150196 the crowd have the right to express their feelings but you wont get a lot out the players of you put them down maybe at home that might be one of the reasons
9150197 they have always been a good footballing team they are a typical northern side that will fight and compete for every ball if we can match that and with the quality they have got we should be asking them some questions
9150198 the players will approach this as though we are playing a championship premiership side we will be tight at the back and looking to give nothing away
9150199 none of my players will be going out there thinking we are playing accrington and we are going to win comfortably as that doesnt happen

9150203 we become so bent out of shape over something as simple as letting your children out of sight on the playground that it starts seeming on par with letting them play on the railroad tracks at night in the rain in dark non reflective coats as if keeping kids under lock and key and helmet and cell phone and nanny and surveillance is the right way to rear kids its not its debilitating for us and for them

9150341 lamore e un incendio che ti sfugge dal controllo che non puoi pi domare che scoppia e non puoi spegnere e travolge tutto quello che trova intorno
9150342 ma aldil delle frasi fatte che una donna vuole sentirsi dire correggetemi se sbaglio penso che non c bisogno di essere degli studiosi per far felice una donna no basta solo lamore e una volta tanto basta solo far parlare il cuore e dire qualcosa di carino ricordandosi sempre che il cuore a parlare perch lamore in fondo solo un incontro di emozioni nate pure e vitali nel nostro profondo e siccome penso che le donne vadano adorate e corteggiate ogni giorno e che ogni giorno vadano premiate per tutto quello che le donne fanno per noi maschietti per rendere loro il nostro grazie basta solo far parlare il cuore e allora si che una donna sar felice

9150348 how he found his way there is a mystery but it certainly made the difference and saved his life

9150351 hes not allowed to stand up or walk around yet because hes got pins in his leg but the vet says hell be able to get around again in about four weeks
9150352 i think it is just a coincidence the chances of a cat finding the vets house are just about zero

9150360 we are trying to create a peer to world interface on the familiar sms platform on a sms 2 0 screen users can send sms to the people whom they know and at the same time they can also access whatever is happening in the world and read the content of their choice
9150361 today mobile phones offer an array of services including internet surfing however users per se are not utilizing it we ensure that instead of expecting users to change their behavior we make all the facilities accessible in offline mode on sms screens because that is what most users do on their mobiles
9150362 so what we offer is decorative sms to attract users and what makes users stick to the sms screen is the value offering to look at the content of their choice every time they open their sms window offering an internet experience on the phone that is available for free
9150363 at geneva we have always been a forerunner in technology in 2006 we developed a product which would send and receive sms in color along with emoticons fonts etc at that time it was called as geneva rainbow sms further we developed yet another interesting application called the geneva secure sms which is basically an sms with a password the applications are unimaginable definitely sms 2 0 has lot in the store for enhancing the user experience
9150364 there are two parts to this application the first part is the phone application that goes on the phone and replaces the sms application this is the proprietary application that has been written by affle we partner with phone manufacturers and phone operating system isvs partnering with them has brought a technology to go and replace the core sms application
9150365 the second part is that the application has the capability to talk to affle servers that resides within the operator environment i e airtel or whoever is the mobile operator these servers constantly have information that every user has defined it keeps track of what each individual likes and ensures that the server has the capability to pull content from various servers finally all the content is intelligently delivered to the right user this is the way the whole application works wherein it has an embedded browser that can talk to the server and releases the content dependent upon what a user likes we need to partner with mobile operators so that the whole ecosystem is established
9150366 sms 2 0 is an application that facilitates the user to send colorful messages the applications are messaging and employing emoticons it cannot be perceived as a platform like the new android by open mobile handset alliance oma and google inc rather it is simply a mobile application
9150367 till date only a few selected handsets are compliant to sms 2 0 such as nokia series 60 phones version 7 and 8
9150368 text messages are great peer to peer message exchanging platform now on the same sms we are trying to create a peer to world interface on this sms 2 0 screen users can not only send sms to the friends but can also access whatever is happening in the world and read content of their choice it is creating a paradigm shift in the field of communication
9150369 in a conventional way user doesnt have much choice in sending or receiving an sms with sms 2 0 user can add fonts colors emoticons expressions to the content and deliver it in the same way
9150370 for the next couple of years we expect both the technologies to co exist right now our primary target audience or the early adopters are the medium and high end handsets that have the hardware as well as software to support this kind of application but at the same time when other handsets also become powerful we will replace them as well
9150371 but these instructors teachers in a general sense personnel who trained others to work on the supplied military equipment are supposed to be in training centers and where were they in the military operations zone
9150372 why did the senior us leadership allow their citizens to be present there when they had no right to be in the security zone and if they allowed it i begin to suspect that it was done intentionally to organise a small victorious war
9150373 and if that failed they wanted to create an enemy out of russia and unite voters around one of the presidential candidates of course a ruling party candidate because it is only the ruling party that has this kind of resource
9150374 we have long ago recognised the borders of modern day ukraine
9150375 we have an agreement with ukraine about maintaining the presence of our fleet until the year 2017 and we will implement that agreement
9150376 if i were to say that we dont care that we were indifferent i would be lying
9150377 of course will leave these positions where we are now we will not remain there forever
9150378 our goal is only to provide security in the region
9150379 no moral right to the role of mentor in matters of international relations and to judge the actions of other states

9150390 nach derzeitigen informationen wurden am tatort spuren gefunden die die vermutung nahe legen dass die sch sse auf das fahrzeug aus deutschen waffen abgegeben worden sind ob auch von anderer seite auf das fahrzeug geschossen wurde ist noch nicht abschlie end gekl rt
9150391 es gibt zurzeit keinen grund den deutschen soldaten einen vorwurf zu machen

9150394 they not only want but expect to have similar technology tools in their offices to those they use in their personal lives
9150395 while older generations may prefer printed job advertisements generation y increasingly consumes media online the baby boomers scoured the newspapers for vacancies and trusted corporate marketing for research about a company but the google generation is doing all this online researching a new job as they would research a consumer product before buying it the increased use of mobile internet through smart phones means career sites also have to be stripped down to work on the simplest online platform
9150396 generation ys conversation takes place in online forums on blogs and on social networks such as linkedin facebook and twitter employers need to have an active online presence to connect with them and become part of the conversation forums and other online spaces are starting to become interesting places to spot great talent
9150397 with little understanding of the internet and the online society employers default to what they know best untargeted recruitment advertising
9150398 but the online shift is not a passing fad and employers who do not move with the times may find it difficult to engage scarce talent in the future
9150399 for example jobvent a peer networking website enables job candidates to rate their experiences of working at a particular company a number of companies with poor employer brands have suffered immense image damage as a result of scathing reviews
9150400 candidates are increasingly compiling video resum s or using linkedin to set up a cv for a global passport to jobs they are also establishing personal networks via sites such as facebook and posting to blogs such as thoughtleader or online forums such as myadsl to build their profiles as specialists on specific topics
9150401 the clips spread like wildfire as the dream job via peer referral on the internet
9150402 some forums are also turning into closed groups where participation is by invitation only employers will have to carefully segment and select their platforms for involvement to ensure the best return on their investments over time
9150403 just as you wouldnt barge in on a group of people having a private conversation you cant just drop in on a blog or forum and immediately start talking about your employer brand you have to join the discussion regularly and contribute ideas over time for anyone to listen to you
9150404 the internet can thereby become a tool for and not a competitor to the print media
9150405 this is an exciting development which completes another important piece of the jig saw in understanding how we might use gene therapy to eventually restore hearing loss
9150406 together with the very positive early signs from other potential treatments such as stem cell therapies it is no longer just a pipe dream to talk about cell and drug based solutions to restore hearing there is a long way to go but the journey towards new treatments is certainly under way
9150407 all the meteorologists predicted katrina would hit new orleans head on
9150408 i dont think anybody anticipated the breach of the levees
9150409 so its quite low in future this ratio has to go up service sector is one from which the government expects to get more revenue in future
9150410 i think the situation is far less serious than what is being portrayed but at the same time certainly something that we are very unhappy about
9150411 i mean people have started comparing it with the 1990s and what not certainly the situation is nowhere around that
9150412 what is causing us concern is that four years of improvement in the situation we believed that we have reduced levels of alienation there were substantial signs of normalcy in the state people had forgotten about issues
9150413 no major concern other than day to day problems of living better electricity internet connection etc suddenly these seem to have been sort of pushed into the background and mobs have come out onto the street
9150414 we are hopeful that this could be achieved in the next one week to 10 days
9150415 in the cold comfort i would say the fact of the matter is that the concern about the blockade could have brought so many people out onto the street is a matter of concern for us
9150416 for a day and a half there were some discrepancies
9150417 if there was let us say 100 trucks going it came down to 15 to 20 for a day and a half and today it is back to about 85 to 90
9150418 i think what really there was an agitation over the issue of the what was wrongly referred to as handing over of land or diversion of land when actually it was not it was not necessary it was an uncalled for mistake
9150419 this is a concern even among the hurriyat and others saying that who is now amongst us who is trying to eliminate some of us
9150420 yeah they will never admit it i suppose but the fact of the matter is that it was certainly not the police he was shot in the back
9150421 so its quite low in future this ratio has to go up service sector is one from which the government expects to get more revenue in future
9150422 its a japanese film that is also an american thriller
9150423 usually people from the outside of the geisha world are not allowed to learn to dance
9150424 the aim of this years festival is to showcase just how absolutely versatile and unique our film industry is besides rays retrospective we have ventured beyond bollywood and have a true representation of indian cinema by giving a platform to some of the finest regional films from our country
9150425 rays films have a huge following among the western audience and its the best platform to bring in a wider audience we are thrilled to showcase five of rays classics on the big screen in new enhanced prints including the eternal much loved timeless classics pather pachali and apur sansar which break all cultural and language barriers
9150426 i am big fan of indian cinema it helps me keep the connection with indian culture
9150427 watching hindi films also complements my other talent i am learning bollywood dancing
9150428 since watching bend it like beckham i have been smitten by indian cinema as it answers a lot of questions about my family who are originally from mauritius which has a strong indian influence
9150429 it is a good idea to broaden the festival now the diverse range in this years festival gives films more validity and helps people understand that indian cinema has a lot of variety and it is not all song and dance
9150430 ray is one of those maestros whose films have not been easily accessible on dvd so this is a unique opportunity to see how his films have stood the test of time
9150431 i am happy to say that in the last four years we have accomplished much in keeping with our commitments
9150432 in our national action for skill development we would like to set for the country an ambitious goal of 500 million of trained people by 2020 in keeping with sonia gandhis vision of rozgar badhao
9150433 the friendship and cooperation agreement that we will sign on saturday opens all avenues for the consolidation of our economic and social partnership and will increase cooperation between the two countries
9150434 italy will be engaged in financing projects and infrastructure in several sectors
9150435 it is not possible today to specify the value of the investments which will flow from this agreement but it will exceed several billion dollars
9150436 il padre di barack obama era musulmano e pertanto in base alla legge islamica lo anche il candidato malgrado i versetti coranici spieghino che non si affatto obbligati a professare la religione un bambino o una bambina musulmani assumono la religione del proprio padre i musulmani di tutto il mondo e ad ogni modo i musulmani che non sono americani non possono far altro che considerare barack hussein obama un musulmano
9150437 obama potrebbe non voler essere considerato musulmano ma i musulmani fanno di tutto per considerarlo come uno di loro
9150438 il simbolismo di uno dei candidati chiave alle presidenziali americane che ha come secondo nome hussein che ha frequentato le elementari in indonesia trasmette indubbiamente qualcosa ai musulmani che non vivono negli stati uniti
9150439 non comprendono di fatto lalbero genealogico di obama ma si rendono conto che se lamerica malgrado sia stata attaccata l11 settembre da militanti musulmani eleggesse come suo presidente un certo ragazzo che fa di secondo nome hussein imprimerebbe una svolta radicale nei rapporti tra gli stati uniti e i musulmani di tutto il mondo
9150440 sfrutterebbe il suo background per sostenere che un apostata a capo della guerra al terrorismo per incitare i simpatizzanti allazione
9150441 un musulmano di nascita un apostata e un convertito al cristianesimo
9150442 some of the most blatant and demeaning situations involved transgender people in a very in your face kind of discrimination and in more subtle ways often it was based on race
9150443 we hear stories about people being discriminated against because of race their caucasian friends make an appointment to see the same apartment and are offered the unit
9150444 educate and penalize those who dont rent to certain people
9150445 in sudbury where there is a real housing shortage we heard some of the issues that go with a virtually zero vacancy rate the people in the most vulnerable groups are being denied housing there
9150446 weve lost a lot of the low end of the market
9150447 it was very upsetting to hear from a large number of women who are harassed many of them single moms with children and on low income by landlords or agents of landlords who asked for sexual favours in order to get repairs done to apartments
9150448 we know the vast majority of landlords want to comply with the human rights code they want clear information about what it means and some may want clarification on what duty to accommodate means
9150449 as an industry were trying to be proactive and educate our members we want them to understand if they have tenants with disabilities that they make sure they are being accommodated a lot of it is common sense the vast majority of landlords out there are upholding the human rights code
9150450 its ok to ask people for the names of previous landlords and to get references the problem is when people ask for income information and draw inferences that because people are low income they are unlikely to pay their rent thats no more an indicator than anything else we know some people go to great efforts and use virtually all their income to pay their rent they may have to go to food banks to feed themselves but paying the rent is the first priority
9150451 i think we can work with the municipalities in getting the word out to those people who provide an important resource to tenants
9150452 when i came back they put up a banner in the post office near here saying miss gerts back
9150453 the answer to our prayers brad pitt and angelina jolie
9150454 green amenities and they look different from what leblanc is used to she said
9150455 if we cant stay there well just stay in a hotel if we have to we love it up there so much
9150456 it will serve as a weekend and summer retreat until i retire although im not exactly sure when that will be
9150457 weve been a retirement destination for people from london kitchener and other parts of southwestern ontario for quite some time now were discovering more and more people from toronto are moving here
9150458 about 100 houses have been built every year for the past five years and we expect our population to climb from its existing 12 000 level to 20 000 over the next 20 years
9150459 port elgin is growing quickly and like most other lakeside communities that growth is concentrated along the shore
9150460 you try to meet people through work through friends not the computer im bad with computers but you get the idea nothing was working out
9150461 i thought it would be a good place to meet young professional women that was the plan
9150462 everyone knew brian and fischer he had a lower unit with a ground floor patio so they were always sitting out front he was a really really nice guy
9150463 then one day he was flirting with me and asked how come you havent gone out with me
9150464 some of the reasons that liberty village is so appealing is that it is a real young hip community with a variety of places to meet people not only are parks and green spaces incorporated into the community but great restaurants and cafes are scattered throughout
9150465 its also affordable for young people who are looking to start out its easy to meet people your age
9150466 you have the best the city can offer within steps of your front door
9150467 we really like the area and all of us especially fischer love hanging out in trinity bellwoods park
9150468 it was mostly jennies idea we thought it would be a really cool fun laid back casual wedding
9150469 there are so many flowers there and the area looks so great already we didnt even really need to decorate
9150470 the whole day was perfect the weather was great all our friends and family were there if there was one perfect thing it was seeing jennie walking out of our place into the courtyard in her dress she looked beautiful
9150471 we took a boat out to this place called lovers beach it was the day after the hurricane i had wanted to do it the day before but we got stuck in the hotel room and it screwed everything up so we took out this boat had a few drinks a bite to eat and then right there on the beach i proposed
9150472 we plan to be here together for a long time
9150473 at work i need all kinds of stuff because i dont know if im going to be cooking for the queen that day
9150474 you dont really slave over a hot stove you spend a lot more time at your sink
9150475 from your stove to your sink should be no more than one step
9150476 suppose youre making pasta you dont want to carry a boiling pot more than a single step
9150477 i have all three garbage recycling and organics within reach of the sink
9150478 its where the waste is generated so it doesnt make sense to have to walk things over
9150479 i have a mixmaster at home it looks awesome but im a professional chef and ive used it five times in two years
9150480 in most cases a 10 hand held mixer can do the job just as well
9150481 but if you have to go electric get one of the ones with the exposed coils not one of those glass covered ones
9150482 you can cook vegetables like asparagus by putting them in with a tiny bit of water and covering them with plastic wrap
9150483 the hardest part for most cooks is getting everything ready at the same time but with a microwave you can cook some things like mashed potatoes ahead of time and then reheat them a few minutes before serving
9150484 a good set of knives will last your whole life
9150485 if i was getting married now the first thing id ask people for would be great knives
9150486 all you really need is a nine inch french knife a four inch paring knife a serrated bread knife and a peeler
9150487 you can add a 12 inch slicer as well good quality kitchen scissors can also come in very handy and a pair of tongs is essential
9150488 it has even heat cleans up easily and the high sides bring the spatter factor down
9150489 who has the time to put them on and take them off
9150490 besides towels can be used to wipe things down or to put under a cutting board to keep it from slipping
9150491 people always ask me how do i know when its done
9150492 the best way is to measure the internal temperature it always works
9150493 ideally you should have a star of your meal and everything else should support it
9150494 i dont want to sound pretentious but i dont really use dried herbs or spices i just dont like the taste
9150495 besides they sell fresh herbs everywhere now and you can even grow your own
9150496 they keep better at room temperature than in the fridge anyway
9150497 bob lo offers a lifestyle experience that really has no precedent in ontario or the u s midwest
9150498 where else will you find a master planned island community with a limited number of homes that already has a natural playground feel to it with its network of trails marina beaches and parkland and yet when you take a look at what we have planned from the pedestrian village to the yacht and tennis club the sense of exclusivity and privilege one gets from living here will only continue to grow
9150499 the west coast eco chic theme mixes design elements associated with conservation natural woods and organic materials such as maple oak and grasscloth with decorative details like bamboo and green accent colours that add a bold dash
9150500 palette of rich char brown java and tobacco tones accented with flashes of adriatic blues and crimson to convey the theme of new elegance which today feels modern with clean lines pared down furnishings and minimal detail
9150501 allowing the dining room to be contained and set apart for special occasions
9150502 feeling of timelessness and romantic memories for owners whose tastes are more traditional
9150503 a completely done home hassle free maintenance and renovation free and covered under the warranty another bonus for buyers would be to work with the builder ahead of time so that deeper window wells can be added for more natural light
9150504 what often happens at a building site is that someone likes the basic plan but their needs dictate different uses for certain areas
9150505 they may want a second floor laundry room and that in turn opens the main floor a little allowing for an enlarged family room they may want a home office near the front door instead of a formal dining room with this flexible home idea they can mix and match one ground floor plan with a completely different second floor plan
9150506 people know us because we live here shop here dine out and have raised a family so we have to be accountable
9150507 we know what families want and need flexibility so involving our in house designer to give buyers that just made sense
9150508 the issue of sanctions is not something we dont care about
9150509 stop stop and again stop it is necessary to do everything to stop this escalation or soon the soon black sea will overflow its shores with foreign warships
9150510 i wont bet on it but at least i hope that european leaders will be able to rise above their emotions and seriously take stock of the perspective of a strategic partnership with russia
9150511 our intent in this book has been especially to consider the importance of the natural world around us as it relates to life at the cottage
9150512 when you connect it to the panel you end up losing power
9150513 i guess i was just in the right place at the right time
9150514 we lined up sponsors like rbc and then vendors either gave us materials or sold it to us at cost
9150515 this is all known technology its just been packaged up
9150516 man st pselt einen usb stick in den rechner der im 2 4 gigahertz bereich musik an die wlan boxen funkt es k nnen bis zu 20 boxen in unterschiedlichen r umen angeschlossen werden wobei die maximal distanz zum usb stick 25 meter betr gt
9150517 theyre great for when hes playing outside with the dog
9150518 if only i could accessorize this outfit with a pair of hot pink plastic clog sandals
9150519 islam isnt in america to be equal to any other faiths but to become dominant the koran the muslim book of scripture should be the highest authority in america and islam the only accepted religion on earth
9150520 we are not fighting so that you will offer us something we are fighting to eliminate you
9150521 first chase out the invaders from our territory in palestine in iraq and everywhere in islamic land
9150522 second instal sharia islamic law on the entire earth and spread islamic justice there the attacks will not cease until after the victory of islam and the setting up of sharia
9150523 no its a private matter and you should delete this diary
9150524 leave here and go to judea so that your disciples also may see the works you are doing for no one who wants to be widely known acts in secret if you do these things show yourself to the world
9150525 my time has not yet come but your time is always here the world cannot hate you but it hates me because i testify against it that its works are evil go to the festival yourselves i am not going to this festival for my time has not yet fully come
9150526 jesus told his brothers that he wasnt going to the festival but then he went in secret
9150527 ive been developing a more liberal faith and understanding of the bible but i cant get to a place where i no longer believe in jesus divinity i wouldnt survive that
9150528 im going to go about this my way not yours
9150529 people dont have a lot of exposure to the army
9150530 britain is more racially diverse than ever which is brilliant
9150531 my worry has nothing to do with peoples skin colour but whether those people are integrating and accepting the customs and cultures of this country the problem comes when you have large numbers of people of all ethnicities who are not willing to use the language who are abusing our system and demand laws are changed to accommodate them
9150532 siamo entrambi di bologna del gruppo di beniamino andreatta anche ovi il consulente di palazzo chigi che segu le vicende dei parenti dellallora premier ndr lo conosco da quando stava alla roche
9150533 organic law of the reordering of the internal market of liquid fuels
9150534 this has a negative psychological effect on the end consumer who at the time of deciding who is to blame points at pdvsa and therefore at the national government
9150535 doesnt have any negative implications for the service stations only that now were going to guarantee that these installations are in excellent condition that they have bathrooms and function during night hours in order to guarantee good public service for our people
9150536 the law does not provide for the forcible transfer of these outlets to the communal councils an aspiration of the bolivarian government is that these popular organizations have an important participation in this activity this change would be progressive and one of the alternatives being studied is the transfer of the administration of new service stations or of some of those that are already property of the state
9150537 the profit derived from this operation goes to the communal bank to finance local projects
9150538 these pitiyanquis venezuelans at the service of us imperialism are trying to manipulate the minds of venezuelans or of a group of venezuelans hiding the truth in an attempt to generate protests so this becomes a call to destabilize the country
9150539 a maneuvering of sectors of the opposition who are trying to create discontent
9150540 anyone can consult the webpage of the national assembly and they would realize that what has been said about this subject in the media is false
9150541 iya mamam juga ga tau kok tiba2 mamam punya lagu itu kata ibu ibu yang telp mamam ih ibu sopyan enak lagunya nah mamam coba telp dari rumah bener enak lagunya
9150542 eh teh gimana dong mamam pengen denger lagunya juga masa yang nelp aja bisa denger lagunya mamam juga pengen bisa ga dipasang begitu
9150543 its the most expensive fine ive seen for a traffic offence handed by the court in alberta
9150544 people are trying to make time on the four lane highway
9150545 its not unusual to see people travelling 160 kmh to 180 kmh on highway 16
9150546 theyre putting themselves and the general public at risk if youre crossing highway 16 you dont anticipate somebody driving at 263 kmh
9150547 weve had him driving since he was about five our feeling was that you teach when theyre young and teach them to respect the machines and know how they operate
9150548 i dont care how good they think they are kids that age do not have the concept of consequences that can happen if they make a mistake
9150549 yesterday he didnt go because my husband had a surprise 40th birthday party for me
9150550 so my family had come up and he was told he could stay home and play with his cousins instead of going to the school
9150551 someone told me when you lose your husband youre a widow when you lose your wife youre a widower when you lose your parents youre an orphan but when you lose your child theres no word for it
9150552 he knew how to operate it he knew what to do just sometimes things happen
9150553 my body temperature is back up to 95 near where it should be it was quite a day
9150554 i hoped to get to france but more than anything i hoped to test myself and i tested myself it was an adventure i dont regret anything it was an incredible journey
9150555 hes been working so hard for this he gave it absolutely his best shot the biggest thing going against him was he didnt have much insulation and that cold water was the biggest challenge
9150556 im just happy hes safe and gave it a good run
9150557 when he looks back on this hell feel very good about the experience so much of this is about the journey and this was a great journey
9150558 a lot of work was put in on this and it culminated with these arrests
9150559 we will allow a sufficient amount of time to inform the public
9150560 this court decision literally isnt a green light for camera enforcement
9150561 im sure there are some people who will want to bring the issue up again
9150562 certainly there are some people who dont like the idea i personally think people driving through red lights kill each other and we should discourage that in a variety of ways
9150563 in conflict with state law because it imposes liability on owners who would not be liable
9150564 undermines the goal set forth by the legislature that repeat offenders should be kept off our roads
9150565 an unsafe driver in davenport is an unsafe driver anywhere else in this state by not applying our suspension and revocation laws uniformly our streets and highways become a more dangerous place
9150566 realistically i dont know that ill be able to send all five of my children to private school nor do i feel that i should have to resort to that
9150567 there are many people who arent able to do that so i want to really get us back to neighborhood schools i really see the importance of that in terms of getting a lot more parental and community involvement
9150568 i feel like im the person most qualified to deal with these construction projects
9150569 i think its a phenomenal choice to mobilize the base
9150570 the running mate who can best help me shake up washington
9150571 well its always though safer in politics to avoid risk to just kind of go along with the status quo but i didnt get into government to do the safe and easy things
9150572 iowans will relate to her unassuming style shes a reform minded executive who brings diversity and unique qualities to mccains ticket
9150573 the contrasts between governor palin and senator biden could not be more stark
9150574 while senator biden has chaired the senate foreign relations committee governor palin has zero foreign policy experience
9150575 i hope i dont have blinders on but i believe she can rally the base
9150576 maybe you are busy and dont have time to vote maybe you are 700 pounds and cant get out of bed to get to the bathroom let alone the polls or hey maybe you just want to vote twice to make sure you get your two cents in
9150577 the point were trying to make with this is whether theyre making a joke this isnt something you want to be doing in any election year
9150578 took some photographs and obtained samples of certain knives and cutting tools used by workers in the production process
9150579 as it has done in the past the company cooperated completely
9150580 no one was arrested and there was no interference with production as the attorney generals press release stated no charges have been filed and the company like everyone else in america is to be presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty
9150581 i think this has captured the urgency of the issue
9150582 shes glib shes well versed on energy and oil issues she has the reputation of being very quick with a good phrase and shes very attractive mccain hasnt gotten much over 44 percent in any poll im sure he felt he had to break some new ground itll be interesting
9150583 at first i felt sorry for her having to go against joe in a debate but now im concerned hell have to put the kid gloves on so he doesnt look like a bully i know he talked about how he wanted so much to debate rudy giuliani because he knew he could crucify him
9150584 i made a choice to run a junior team in quebec city and because of that i didnt have time to go to the bell centre
9150585 i would have like to have gone to some events like the jersey retirements of bob gainey and serge savard i would have liked to go see ex rempart alexander radulov play against the canadiens but each time it was impossible
9150586 the next u s president is going to be ishmael whether we like it or not and whether he knows it or not
9150587 worth a look it is however recommended by matthew dancona
9150588 on the internet i keep in touch with opendemocracy a website on global current affairs and its useful offshoot ourkingdom
9150589 e in tema sicurezza di portatili oggi vi voglio proporre
9150590 the army will not stage a coup the political crisis should be resolved by political means
9150591 you arent him i saw something of him in you i thought i did i was wrong
9150592 we could make love in the dark we did that i could pretend i was him

9150596 i think a country like russia that protected its citizens and fulfilled its peacekeeping duties wont be held in isolation no matter what our partners think within the limits of their bloc europe and the u s are not the whole world
9150597 speaking about the georgian leadership people who wreck the territorial integrity and national identity of their country with their actions shouldnt be ruling that country be it big or small they should resign straight away
9150598 of course its up to them but we all remember the precedents that we have in history lets remember how u s troops entered iraq and what they did with saddam hussein for destroying several shiite villages here ten ossetian villages were destroyed right out
9150599 arent you aware of whats been going on in georgia in the last few years the mysterious death of prime mnister zhvania fighting with the opposition the violent dispersal of protest demonstrations holding a national election during a practical state of emergency and now this criminal action in south ossetia with many casualties you call it a democratic country negotiating with it and thinking it should be admitted to nato and the eu
9150600 we dont have any special rules of our own by which we are going to play we want everybody to play by the same rules these are called international law but we dont want anyone manipulating them playing it one way in one region and another way in another region to suit their own interests we want to have the same rules for everyone which would take into account the interests of all members of the international community
9150601 russia isnt out to aggravate the situation or to put pressure on anyone we want good neighbourly relations and partnerships with everyone
9150602 i am sure part of it was becoming familiar with the test which kept my overall anxiety down but another part of it was maine preps help

9150702 shes a mother shes young she knows where shes been and what shes doing and her sons in the iraq war
9150703 shes pro life anti gun control really the ideological opposite of hillary im not sure how many nonideological clinton voters there are to attract
9150704 one of our weak points has been working moms stay at home moms soccer moms

9150835 when it comes to touring pakistan no team have been more narrow minded than australia who at the same time as showing unconditional love for india and the marketing opportunities it allows they have not toured pakistan since 1998 bombs in jaipur and london carry a more lucrative blast
9150836 make no mistake despite the red flag being waved by the administrators this tournament was postponed because the players from south africa new zealand england and australia didnt fancy going they didnt want to go to pakistan and no amount of persuasion on behalf of the hosts and no amount of armor plated security was going to change that
9150837 impotence of the icc and the incompetence of many of the national governing bodies
9150838 religious faith especially christianity as unenlightened foolish and sometimes even dangerous
9150839 if you play chelsea and manchester united in your opening two games it will always be difficult
9150840 harry redknapp has built a really good team peter crouch has been a good signing they have jermain defoe as well who is a threat
9150841 they are strong defensively and pushed us all the way for fifth last season
9150842 as for jerome thomas hes never had a back problem before and we dont know why hes got one now maybe its because of a change of beds since he moved here it could be anything
9150843 we have a top class back specialist here and hopefully he can put him right
9150844 once things settle down behind the scenes and stabilises then i think the players will be pleased
9150845 but were here to do a job and all that stuff is not really any of our business to be honest
9150846 its happening at the club we play for but its not a lot to do with us and we just have to focus on what were doing
9150847 it is important for tottenham not to lose another game they want their first three points in the league so we have some problems we know this
9150848 but this is a big chance for tottenham because it is a derby we need to respect them even more
9150849 we need to start getting points on the board and i think having a game like chelsea at this time gives us a great chance to lift the spirits
9150850 the game plan should be to go there and play with an ambitious attacking style of football without fear
9150851 the team that takes its chances on the day will be the one who prevails
9150852 dean windass just wants to play football i gave him that opportunity at swansea on tuesday
9150853 he said to me he just wants to score goals and he has done that so he is ticking all the boxes
9150854 do i repay him with a start against wigan the answer to that will remain to be seen
9150855 i think chris kirkland should be okay for the hull game
9150856 he had a spasm while we were away in pre season and it tightens up and stiffens up a bit but we dont think it is anything too serious so with a bit of tlc he will be fine
9150857 he has been to see specialists and were okay with him hes comfortable with the whole situation at the moment so we dont think there is really anything to unduly worry us
9150858 theyve got some talented boys they beat us twice last year we hopefully can do better this year against them but mark hughes is proving to be a very good manager
9150859 weve had two away victories on the spin which has been fantastic but we appreciate for us to have a decent season we have to back up our home form from last year with some decent results away from home
9150860 lets stop talking about changing our world by changing your light bulbs there are a few reasons why people tell you that switching from

9150863 there are around 100 000 people from the subcontinent in the province of brescia and they want to play cricket so the council had to provide pitches to stop people being struck by cricket balls
9150864 i struggled to fit in when i arrived but i am now proud to represent italy
9150865 it will take a maximum of two months for zardari and others to get acquitted from all the cases and that too through a legal process
9150866 i believe some close aides of zardari have made the restoration of justice iftikhar an issue out of personal ego and consistently urge him asif zardari not to restore him
9150867 i could see that youre a bit of a pansy

9150888 but civil rights struggles are incremental and were moving the ball up the field here
9150889 ive been to afghanistan ive been to iraq seven times ive been in the balkans ive been in the foxholes with these kids literally in bunkers with them let me tell you something nobody asks anybody else whether theyre gay in those foxholes
9150890 weve got a war on our hands were trying to end and in the meantime were breaking the military nine thousand of these people have been kicked out this is not a rational policy
9150891 because it was the wrong direction and the wrong message
9150892 if public officials conclude that the civil union law has not worked to provide same sex couples the legal protections that marriage would
9150893 new jersey wants to end discrimination in marriage and is ready for our public officials to do it right now the civil union law is one of the greatest civil rights failures of our time new jersey sees that and understands that justice delayed is justice denied

9150899 we may disagree with the foundation of the court decision
9150900 but our responsibility is to proceed forward with the law and abide by the constitution
9150901 defendant physicians contend that exposing them to liability for refusing to perform the iui intrauterine insemination medical procedure for plaintiff infringes upon their first amendment rights to free speech and free exercise of religion not so
9150902 californias unruh civil rights act imposed on business establishments certain antidiscrimination obligations thus precluding any such establishment or its agents from telling patrons that it will not comply with the act
9150903 theres a great diversity of religious beliefs in california and theyre all protected but not to the point where laws are violated and other people are hurt each of us is protected both in our religious beliefs and also from religiously based discrimination in the doctors office and other commercial settings
9150904 its wrong and shocking that some doctors felt their religious beliefs allowed them to ignore the law and discriminate
9150905 this isnt just a win for me personally and for other lesbian women its a win for everyone because anyone could be the next target if doctors are allowed to pick and choose their patients based on religious views about other groups of people
9150906 several years ago the association booked rooms at the san diego marriott and the manchester grand hyatt
9150907 our contracts with the hotels provide that each hotel reserve a block of guest rooms and leave to the aals the choice of where to locate the aals registration exhibit hall section programs presidential programs and house of representatives meetings we will honor our contracts with both hotels and we have exercised our option to hold all aals events at the marriott to ensure the maximum participation by our members
9150908 the wilde awards give us an opportunity to celebrate and honor the people and organizations that enrich our cultural lives here in southeast and mid michigan
9150909 rather than mourn his loss we wanted to celebrate his life
9150910 and what better way to do that than to present an award each year to a deserving group or individual that accomplishes what jim did in his everyday life which was to build important and much needed bridges between and among the various communities to which he belonged

9150919 the mayors of vilnius and kaunas are sending a clear message that lgbt people are still not welcome in their diverse communities and are creating some kind of 21st century apartheid
9150920 homosexuals who find it impossible to live in such a situation are forced to emigrate to more tolerant european cities
9150921 to say that its time for us to get our freedom from being treated as criminals under indian law
9150922 today we invoke the father of our nations spirit and call on the british government to apologize for the legacy of hatred they left us in the form of section 377 of the indian penal code
9150923 through this law the idea of treating homosexuals as criminals was imposed by the colonial government on the more tolerant traditions of india through laws like section 377 the british imposed victorian ideas of morality that have come back to haunt us in the form of rising hiv rates among queer men who are forced to have sex in secret and unsafely in the form of persecution of hijras eunuchs who are treated as unnatural despite their ancient history in india and in the form of the suppression of the lives of women who love women
9150924 local newspapers across the country are reflecting the growing visibility of our lives and our commitments by opening their pages to these stories
9150925 when we seize that opportunity to share our milestones and celebrations we help americans see the diversity of our community and recognize the common ground that we share
9150926 an attack against this memorial is clearly directed against homosexuals that can be said without waiting for further police investigations we must show our condemnation of this act of intolerance and homophobia
9150927 in many parts of the world people are still persecuted because of their sexual identity homosexual love is a criminal offense and a kiss can spell danger
9150928 the cameroonian player left for england on friday to undergo a medical with newcastle united but then surprisingly turned up at team training

9150936 he did what he had to do he went out there and he made pitches
9150937 its good to go out there every fifth game and feel good
9150938 im not exactly going out there and being totally dominant
9150939 it started in portland the start of the year was so cold i dont like wearing sleeves just playing in portland it was so cold i just wanted to keep my arm warm my throwing arm warm i dont like the bulk of wearing a long sleeve shirt had success there so i just kept on wearing it

9150943 it was literally something that happened one morning like yknow
9150944 if don henley and lindsey buckingham wouldve come up in the f internet age theyd both be in jail right now
9150945 but aside from the official release of a new track next month for rock band 2 there has been no official word on when the follow up to 1993s covers only album the spaghetti incident might actually be available to buy
9150946 years ago i saw a lot of my friends not be there for their kids or their spouses when we were all doing what we thought we had to do to be creative
9150947 the sense of stability and the sense of almost de prioritizing the career has actually enhanced the sense of having fun with it and the sense of being able to be productive with it
9150948 on a broader level when you look at the different people in fleetwood mac the key thing right now for us is to dignify how we got started and the road we have left to go to make sure that its done in a way which is fundamentally supportive of each other and acknowledging of the love we have for each other now
9150949 that was by far the best outcome because not only did it reinforce the idea that the real mantra here is for the four of us to work on our own thing
9150950 im just f sick of it i want to be liberated from that word and all that i feel that the streets should be
9150951 if i eat you like a cannibal aint nothin to it gangsta rap made me do it
9150952 i just let it be one of the scars of life i went though
9150953 i remember we left and youre never supposed to leave the scene of an accident
9150954 at the hospital the doctors said that if they hadnt moved me i would have died
9150955 so its quite low in future this ratio has to go up service sector is one from which the government expects to getmore revenue in future
9150956 the total impact of that the post budget reductions is about minus rs 20 000 crore rs 200 billion
9150957 but in spite of that we are hopeful that with additional revenue on service tax and some policy factors which have come the target of rs 3 20 000 crore rs 3 200 billion will be able to achieve
9150958 i am fit feeling really good and i hope we can put on a good performance in gladbach and take the three points back home with us
9150959 of course i want to play tomorrow but i dont necessarily have to play in the role behind the strikers i can also play on the left or right flank
9150960 we have to make decisions every weekend which are relatively close calls every single player needs to question his own performance every week we consider everything and then make our decision based on what we feel is the best solution thats the team that plays

9151029 well be hiring more workers within the next 6 months why because while some jobs will be made redundant in the new profit model we can take the talents of these valuable employees and parlay them into other equally paying jobs within our corporate structure
9151030 we chose to use perl in our las vegas nevada politics text studies because it is a lingual programming language

9151074 de keure bewijst dat dendermonde in 1233 een belangrijke nederzetting was beschermd door stenen stadsmuren
9151075 uit de keure zelf blijkt bovendien dat dendermonde reeds voordien bestuurd werd door een raad van schepenen die bevoegd waren op het grondgebied van de stad en haar vrijheid ook inzake juridische aangelegenheden de dendermondse keure handelt in een dertigtal punten hoofdzakelijk over de strafrechterlijke bevoegdheden van de stadsschepenbank en over de rechtsmiddelen tot een beter vonnis deze keure is gebaseerd op de grote keure die graaf filips van de elzas aan de belangrijkste vlaamse steden gegeven had zij het met enkele aanpassingen aan specifieke dendermondse situaties of gewoonten zo werd de maximale geldboete in dendermonde van 60 pond teruggebracht op 20 pond deze boeten gingen volledig naar de heer dit is een gevolg van de zeer ongelijke machtsverhouding tussen de heer en de stad zij is dus net als de grote keure zeer autoritair en vorstelijk geori nteerd een heer die een dergelijke keure aan een stad kon opleggen moet een zeer grote re le macht gehad hebben dit was zeker het geval voor robrecht van b thune die door de personele unie van de heerlijkheden b thune en dendermonde een van de rijkste en meest invloedrijke edelen van het graafschap vlaanderen was

9151078 during the 2006 war we considered the possibility of attacking lebanons infrastructure but we never sic resorted to this option because we thought at the time that not all the lebanese were responsible for the hizbollah attacks at that time we had hizbollah in our sights and not the lebanese state but the hizbollah do not live on the moon and some sic infrastructure was hit

9151113 the fundamental principle behind any selection of a running mate would be whether that person is fully prepared to take over and shares your values your principles your philosophy and your priorities
9151114 and i dont think that that would necessarily would rule tom ridge out
9151115 she was scheduled for a high profile speaking role at our convention and included in the vp selection process because of his admiration for her strong reform credentials

9151141 niki wondered what gave the trinity the right to change things at the dictactes of his whims
9151142 as i sat by my window and staring out at the wonderful washington d c landscape my office announced a phone call from air force one
9151143 its just another opportunity for him to create that lasting republican majority he envisioned years ago and to spend his waking days doing what he so enjoys beating democrats in the alleys and gutters just ask sen hillary clinton mr roves target when he called in to speak to rush limbaugh he couldnt help it mr rove just had to take one last shot before riding out of town more to come team clinton
9151144 the idea is to re energize the african american electorate and revive the democratic party at the same time
9151145 i want to revitalize the party from the grass roots up were losing voters
9151146 chirpily exchange e mail chat on the phone and write letters indulging in their shared zeal for the inner workings of politics
9151147 mr norquist said he and ms brazile both washington residents were devising a plan to urge congress to allow the city to raise the height limit on buildings as a way to broaden the tax base and improve schools
9151148 this is a new moment to identify and recruit better messengers
9151149 perhaps its time to tap into the obama factor scour statehouses for young energetic inspiring and emerging leaders with the ability to connect the head and heart too many of the old democratic guard have stayed in washington d c too long to fully recognize how most americans live their lives
9151150 while my family was hurting when they were on the edge feeling left to fend for themselves the last thing i wanted to do was whine i got into the groove quickly and contacted ken melhman chairman of the republican national committee and an old friend karl rove deputy chief of staff for the white house
9151151 president bush who promised to rebuild the gulf coast in a speech at jackson square invited some african american leaders over to the white house on december 7th to discuss a broad range of issues to my great surprise the meeting with president bush was cordial and candid the president listened intently and reassured us that his administration would not drop the ball
9151152 since then i have met once more with president bush and other leaders who are committed to working together to restore the lives and the communities devastated by these two hurricanes i can tell from the meetings that the rebuilding of louisiana remains high on his list of priorities
9151153 including two more states will not only be good for our country it will be good for our party and good for our nominee
9151154 if you campaign in a state that is outside the rules then youre not entitled to delegates from that state
9151155 i understand that theyre envious of the role that iowa and new hampshire have traditionally played the truth is we had a process were going to back these rules
9151156 it was hardly an extraordinary act although you wouldnt know it from the furious reaction that ensued in some quarters why the uproar its simple state envy
9151157 if 795 of my colleagues decide this election i will quit the democratic party
9151158 as an african american i find his words and his tone to be very depressing
9151159 despite obamas impressive victories in february clintons comeback is based on sowing political seeds of doubt
9151160 if these attacks are contrasts based on policy differences there is no need to stop the race or halt the debate but if this is more division more diversion from the issues and more of the same politics of personal destruction chairman dean and other should be on standby
9151161 it was a mess overwhelmed polling places with long lines some up to three hours too few ballots confusion over where to vote
9151162 in rio rancho one of the states largest cities a single polling location where 1 900 people remain lined up at 7 p m on election night
9151163 the 675 000 members of dfa gathered tens of thousands signatures on a national call to action wrote over 6 124 letters to iowa dfa members and plastered the des moines register with an ad asking iowa democrats to not leave their caucus until a progressive wins their location
9151164 if you listened to people last year it was as if there was no need to vote there was all this talk about inevitability but tonight democracy for americas members here in iowa proved that primaries matter progressive values are what make the democratic party strong said jim dean chair of dfa
9151165 my mama taught me to play by the rules and respect the rules when you decide to change the rules especially in the middle of the game its called cheating
9151166 how many ways do these hillary delegates voters and supporters need to hear it before they get it sen barack obama is the partys nominee he won he will get to choose his running mate obama sets the agenda for the convention and while i understand their passion in wanting hillary to be on the ticket and to have a prominent role at the convention its not her decision as much as we all would have loved to see a woman in the oval office it wasnt hillarys time period

9151235 based on previous studies we expected to see an acceleration in the decline in cognitive abilities before death
9151236 however the onset of this acceleration was much earlier than we expected
9151237 the findings imply that the brain changes that influence cognitive abilities in old age occur over a relatively long period of time
9151238 one study found evidence for terminal decline 3 33 years before death in semantic memory 6 years in visuospatial ability and only 2 75 years in perceptual speed
9151239 our findings for both verbal ability and spatial ability are similar to this estimate but our estimate for perceptual speed is much longer
9151240 our finding that speed was the earliest marker of mortality related decline is in line with these findings
9151241 subsequent studies need to illuminate these issues and identify the neurobiological markers for terminal decline
9151242 one of the limitations to this longitudinal study that started more than 35 years ago is that we do not have detailed information about brain pathology from brain scans or indexes of biomarker from cerebrospinal fluids
9151243 another limitation that critics might address is that our tests didnt cover all cognitive domains for example episodic memory known to be highly sensitive for change in aging and in various diseases
9151244 we know how important intact cognitive capabilities are for well being and everyday life functioning in old age

9151273 we showed that severe stress alone in the absence of infection malnutrition or environmental changes is related to later schizophrenia furthermore we were able to pinpoint the timing of this risk and showed there was sex specificity and that female offspring are at much greater risk than males
9151274 we looked at the timing of the individuals birth to narrow down month by month the exact point in their gestational life the insult took place and then correlated that information with a diagnosis of schizophrenia in later life
9151275 there may be a survival effect at play so it is not necessarily that female fetuses are more susceptible to schizophrenia due to maternal stress but that they are less likely to be aborted in the presence of maternal stress
9151276 severe stress may just be the tip of the iceberg we must keep in mind that the brain doesnt develop from a blueprint and stress during pregnancy can program genes for many medical conditions
9151277 i believe theres very little information given to pregnant women about the need to reduce stress well before and during pregnancy a certain amount of maternal stress is absolutely necessary for healthy fetal development but women should be advised to as much as they can lead a healthy life that includes exercise proper sleep good nutrition and reduced stress we want all our patients to live a healthy lifestyle and heres 1 more reason to

9151306 i think hes going to evolve into eventually supporting anwr opening also id like the opportunity to change his mind about anwr
9151307 its really probably out of the realm of possibility to be tapped for that position so i dont even have to worry about it
9151308 its a matter of what the attacker can get to and in what order
9151309 if you spend time patching vulnerabilities the attacker cant get to first

9151331 usually they just have a little card table stuck off somewhere
9151332 its not that people want mccain its that they dont want obama
9151333 has switched some people would say flip flopped on immigration and hes been a little soft on the judicial
9151334 theyre afraid of him to be honest with you whered he come from
9151335 because republicans of course are drill here drill now drill anwr
9151336 a lot of people are irritated about this immigration my wife is from england and it took two years for her to get here legally so it burns her up to hear about these mexicans coming here
9151337 mccain as a republican were not too thrilled with him he jumps the fence a little too much out of the comfort zone you dont want to be too nice and give conservative values away
9151338 well hold our nose and vote for him because with the fight on terror john mccain will be right there where with obama who knows
9151339 hed vote for anyone black or anyone as long as he was a democrat
9151340 i dont like obama i dont think he can take us in a better direction or keep all his promises
9151341 i am in such a frenzy over who to vote for
9151342 on abortion and gay marriage and all that stuff but im disappointed in mccain
9151343 all the mud slinging back and forth im not much on that my husband says michelle its part of politics but i dont think it has to be
9151344 seem to be leaning obama too on health care issues

9151346 who got the buyout and are looking for their next crop
9151347 the main thing i say now is do you know the no 1 reason gas is going down is because people are driving less and they say yeah and the thing that makes me furious is my pickup truck gets 13 miles a gallon because its cheaper to buy a politician than to build me a truck thats more fuel efficient even very republican people nod when you say its the american people that are getting it done they say i havent driven my truck in a week so people already know it
9151348 his answer on everything was drill in anwr if you asked him about the situation in georgia he was like we should probably drill in anwr
9151349 perriello accused goode of voting consistently for legislation that increased the profits of oil companies and said goode had 200 000 of investments in energy stocks
9151350 goode replied that his energy policy is pro drill pro conservative and pro alternative energy goode said he has voted for solar energy bills wind energy bills and biofuels boos erupted apparently from perriello supporters when goode said he favored drilling for oil in anwr the arctic national wildlife refuge undaunted goode said at least three more times that he favored a pro drill policy of searching for oil in the united states and offshore

9151353 theres no hurry anymore when all is said and done
9151354 the brown malt is the soonest and highest dryed of any even till it is so hard that its difficult to bite some of its corns asunder and is often so crusted or burnt that the farinous part loses a great deal of its essential salts and vital property
9151355 in most parts of the west their malt is so stenched with the smoak of the wood with which tis dryed that no stranger can endure it though the inhabitants who are familiarized to it can swallow it as the hollanders do their thick black beer brewed with buck wheat
9151356 in some places it malt is dried at leisure with wood alone or straw alone in other with wood and straw together but of all the straw dried is the most excellent for the wood dried malt when it is brewed beside that the drink is higher of colour it doth hurt and annoy the head of him that is not used thereto because of the smoke such also as use both indifferently do bark cleave and dry their wood in an oven thereby to remove all moisture that should procure the fume
9151357 brown malts are dryed with straw wood and fern etc the straw dryed is the best but the wood sort has a most unnatural taste that few can bear with but the necessitous and those that are accustomed to its strong smoaky tang yet it is much used in some of the western parts of england and many thousand quarters of this malt has been formerly used in london for brewing the butt keeping beers with and that because it sold for two shillings per quarter cheaper than straw dryed malt nor was this quality of the wood dryed malt much regarded by some of its brewers for that its ill taste is lost in nine or twelve months by the age of the beer and the strength of the great quantity of hops that were used in its preservation
9151358 the third error consists in the drying of malt they are apt to be tainted by the smoke through the carelessness covetousness or unskilfulness of the maker every care ought to be taken to guard against this accident as one of the most prejudicial that can befall malt drinks

9151365 it is pretty audacious for the obama campaign to say that governor palin is not qualified to be vice president

9151386 ini merupakan satu kerugian kerana dalam konsep kerajaan persekutuan rakyat di dalam negeri tersebut berhak menikmati apa yang kerajaan mahu beri projek ini kita mahu anugerahkan kepada rakyat perak yang miskin tegar tetapi oleh sebab tanah di bawah bidang kuasa kerajaan negeri mereka menolak projek yang menjadi hak rakyat

9151407 ma la conosco la trama del mio racconto arriva al punto
9151408 lo sapevo il protagonista del racconto sei tu stesso tu che scrivi per celare il fatto di non saper scrivere
9151409 non farmi ridere uno scrittore non scrive di quello che sa uno scrittore scrive e basta ma tu non sei uno scrittore perch non conosci la semplicit di una frase n sai tradurre le emozioni in parole cosa dovrebbe fare qualcuno nella tua situazione lasciar perdere la scrittura oppure impegnarsi con costanza e rigore sino a riuscire in quel che oggi non sa fare tu invece hai fatto come tanti hai preso la scorciatoia della metaletteratura cio di un genere che dovrebbe essere appannaggio esclusivo degli autori maturi e non degli esordienti ecco la tua furbizia ti metti a cianciare della difficolt di scrivere come se fossi uno scrittore navigato e invece la tua opera prima chi vuoi che si interessi delle tue chiacchiere

9151416 parents are concerned and have asked is there anything that can be done to prevent or reduce the numbers of ice creams vans that come into estates all year around
9151417 they dont have a problem during the summer months when it is a treat but all year around is a different thing and it is putting parents under pressure
9151418 on the one hand they have programmes to prevent illness and disease and tackle the problems of childhood obesity and the rise in diabetes and on the other hand they are saying off you go to ice cream vans and telling them they can tout their business all year around
9151419 they play music that is very appealing and are coming into estates three times a day parents need support
9151420 children are constantly looking for money there are at lease two vans operating in the estate at four six and seven oclock this is something we should support these vendors are taking advantage of vulnerable people
9151421 its nanny state gone mad the idea seems to be that it is somehow the fault of the ice cream vendor if children eat too much ice cream when really it is a question of responsibility and it is up to parents to act as parents

9151441 the standard way to hard boil eggs in europe and america 10 minutes in boiling water is not ideal the trouble 212 degrees fahrenheit is far higher than the temperature at which the egg whites and the yolks coagulate
9151442 egg whites are made up of protein and water yolks contain fat as well as eggs cook their balled up proteins uncoil into strands and the strands bind together to form an intricate mesh that traps water in essence the proteins form a gel a liquid dispersed in a solid boiling causes too many egg proteins to bind and form dense meshes so there is less sensation of water in the mouth voil rubbery egg whites and sandy grayish yolks
9151443 cook meat at high temperature to seal in the juices its not true use only eggs at room temperature for making mayonnaise not true either season steak with salt before cooking or salt it afterward makes no difference as the salt doesnt penetrate the meat
9151444 it is a tragedy yet a fact that within history and journalism

9151450 in the last six eight months there is a sea change the way we see the business climate today from a development side a huge slowdown has occurred because of oil subsidy and the waiver the 8 5 to 9 economic growth that we saw over the four years i would not put it now anywhere near that
9151451 i can see there is hesitancy in investing because the prices have somewhat dropped interest rates have gone up so much that people cannot afford with that emi to buy a house within that income
9151452 we do see a certain deferral in certain projects coming up in major projects and investments but this doesnt affect us in the near future it is because the time that we take for delivering these projects varies to about 18 months to a factor that goes up to about 36 to 40 months
9151453 because of the non availability of money as it used to be available earlier our distributors or customers have to get used to the non availability so a couple of percentage of growth will get hampered
9151454 we are about 80 of domestic and about 20 of gulf but we will have to be probably around 65 70 of domestic and about 30 35 of gulf
9151455 even in 20 25 we want to ensure that we have a back to back arrangement for procurement of material at the time of bidding its always not possible to get there and secondly sometimes the customer takes time to decide about the project supposing he takes six months to decide the project the vendor may not keep the validity of prices for such a long period of time but our effort is to minimize that portion through back to back arrangement
9151456 fried red meat at the back left a salad cant remember if there was any whale in it but there may have been and

9151496 its all about setting a goal about discipline teamwork and then success
9151497 she took butchered crab portions arranged them in a basket for cooking
9151498 that caribou has had a good life its been free out there on the tundra not caged up on a farm with no place to go
9151499 some of the things im doing its obvious im not running for miss congeniality
9151500 shes just been able to get in with issues and get press on it and she knows sort of what the public wants to hear and has been able to place her positions around those sort of issues that are important to people here the values that are important to people here
9151501 i dont think you can underestimate her as a politician
9151502 many people will express sympathy but you dont want or need that because trig will be a joy you have to trust me on this
9151503 its gender its age its kind of the maverick being from the outside

9151509 she can relate to our struggles and our own lives
9151510 but having said that one thing i do know is that people made the mistake of underestimating her at least underestimating that ability to connect with people
9151511 there were no public policy initiatives no grasp of public policy but people loved her
9151512 but that took it out of the realm of the poseur and established a great deal of trust with voters
9151513 after the election there was a sort of veil that dropped and there has really been no way to be able to communicate
9151514 when people say it that way it sounds like a good thing
9151515 but frankly in terms of running the government its a handicap she doesnt want to do politics as usual but she doesnt have another method other than beating the crap out of the legislature
9151516 we are in the midst of quite a period of revelation and we dont know where this will all lead

9151586 we strongly recommend restrictions in the use of thiazolidinediones the class of drugs and question the rationale for leaving rosiglitazone on the market
9151587 at this time justification for use of thiazolidinediones is very weak to non existent
9151588 further compound their already increased risk of developing ischemic heart disease

9151591 the increased heart failure appears to be a class effect
9151592 the unfavorable findings from the three trials have not been fully realized by the medical community
9151593 safer cheaper and more effective treatment alternatives are available that do not carry these negative cardiovascular risks in patients with diabetes the rationale for the use of the thiazolidinediones is unclear

9151600 members at the sheffield star have voted resoundingly in favour of strike action
9151601 this isnt something they will have done lightly but its clear that they feel incredibly strongly about the future of their paper the proposed cuts are bad for the star and the communities it serves

9151679 standing up with courage and clear purpose they somehow managed to change the world
9151680 our little room looked very bare at first with nothing on the walls

9151683 i said im going to be available my arm feels great
9151684 they told me i was going to a contending team and that made it a little easier to accept than if i was going to a team that was out of the race that would have been different this is a good opportunity for me
9151685 in case of war redzikowo and slupsk will be more secure than other places and not less secure
9151686 you condemned redzikowo and slupsk to annihilation like hiroshima and nagasaki
9151687 from the point of view of polands interests we will be strategically more secure
9151688 i am the last person to seek conflict with our neighbors but as prime minister i must not leave poland defenseless
9151689 can you deny that having the shield base redzikowo will be target no 1 for countries that dont agree with it
9151690 i prefer to have here american troops rather than soviet troops
9151691 we are getting anyone who has not received their solutions to call their congressman and senators to get their friends family and neighbors to call the ceos of banks
9151692 we are giving them all their addresses and phone numbers
9151693 the only problem is ceos have a lot of property and there are a lot of doors to knock on but its personal and were going to make it personal
9151694 if they have some races where they are a little slower and were good then well probably make the chase
9151695 every day they threaten me and want to drive me out of ossetia
9151696 i think republicans are more accustomed to following the rules
9151697 sarah how a hockey mom turned alaskas political establishment upside down
9151698 we feel really good about some things that are happening

9151700 the indians like a lot of american league teams make you throw a lot of pitches
9151701 their hitters did a good job you could see why theyd won 10 in a row they made a guy with excellent stuff work hard
9151702 i made the pitches i had to make to get out of jams
9151703 you play so many games they all kind of run together
9151704 you dont really think about what month it is i just try to go out and prepare and compete every day
9151705 raul is one of those guys whose quality of play wont match the quality of man he is
9151706 hes one of the finest people in baseball and everybodys thrilled hes having this kind of year
9151707 theres just not that many more names we would consider we probably wont announce that until the day it happens
9151708 big incentive to buy now versus later when you most likely wont have that option for you
9151709 it makes a lot of sense for builders to do a lot of promotions on that
9151710 were trying to let everyone know hey this is going away
9151711 if you can come up with some way to monetize it ahead of time it could help to offset the loss of that down payment assistance

9151715 the former mayor of a small town with zero foreign policy experience
9151716 her selection is yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics
9151717 we should all be proud of gov sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and sen mccain while their policies would take america in the wrong direction gov palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9151718 now its a crime of necessity for people who are desperate to maintain lifestyles they became accustomed to
9151719 pay stub and job verifications show the income you need on paper
9151720 although these stubs are authentic looking and will fool anyone everytime
9151721 for a 10 filing fee 9 out of 10 times in those counties theyll file whatever you want
9151722 it may start decreasing in september depending upon upstream discharge
9151723 we are facing labor problems law and order problems and logistics problems
9151724 this whole area is under 3 or 4 feet of water
9151725 there is only one doctor here and he cannot cater to all the people
9151726 i think the positive is were going to know exactly where we are
9151727 when you play a team the caliber of missouri its going to give you an opportunity to know exactly where your program is and the things you have to work on
9151728 i remember a year ago we were fortunate to win
9151729 oh by the way they did go to the rose bowl i think they have a lot of impact players
9151730 i can understand why the fans wouldnt know what to expect because in some respect the coaches dont either
9151731 have to fund the rest through cash or credit cards

9151737 if you live in a 1 million home 10 000 is not going to cover the cost of new kitchen cabinets or do anything for the master bath
9151738 but if you live in a home thats worth 450 000 to 650 000 you can probably do your countertops and your master bath
9151739 if you are in there in 10 years does it matter what the return on investment was
9151740 they are putting espresso makers in bathrooms heated floors heated towel bars if that is the kind of thing you are looking for then go for it

9151744 landscaping has a big impact on the value of your home it has a big first impression
9151745 your yard is the biggest room in your house if you think about it
9151746 just changing the color on one wall can change the way the floor space looks without structural changes
9151747 something being eliminated is better than something being overgrown on the front of the home a typical exterior aesthetic faux pas is people getting attached to bushes they planted 15 years ago
9151748 marble and granite are being thrown away every single day
9151749 it brings uniqueness to the house it is hard to talk about in real estate terms but it is an unconscious feeling you have when you open a space
9151750 we almost always think now about what can we do with this outdoor adjacent space so its not just a yard its a good way to add that extra flair that nobody else has
9151751 you can create a separate place from your house to entertain
9151752 you dont need the most extensive features using indirect lighting fluorescent light can make a big difference
9151753 make sure your interior doors are solid core not hollow
9151754 it gets a lot more substance and heft when you open and close your doors they should have a weight to them windows and doors can make or break a house
9151755 it can take at least two years for plants to get to a somewhat mature size but trees will take five to six years
9151756 no one should expect a garden to pop out of the ground
9151757 from beginning to end this has been a very rough experience
9151758 there will be a lot of people who will benefit from this now and unfortunately in the future
9151759 after the sacrifice i made i felt a little bit abandoned by the government
9151760 governor palin and john mccain are a good match because they both want to overturn roe v wade they both want to continue the failed economic policies of the bush administration and they both offer more of the same
9151761 were going to beat the hell out of em in november
9151762 last night hillary told us in no uncertain terms she is going to do everything she can to elect barack obama
9151763 hillary moving for acclamation just put the good housekeeping stamp of approval on the whole thing

9151780 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9151781 un provvedimento serio e condivisibile perch in italia esiste una vera e propria emergenza educativa a cui la scuola non pu sottrarsi
9151782 ludc ha sempre creduto fina dalla scorsa legislatura nella necessit di reintrodurre il voto in condotta e di riportare nelle aule scolastiche lo studio delleducazione civica quindi non possiamo che essere soddisfatti cera bisogno da parte del governo di un segnale forte ed arrivato conclude ciocchetti adesso spetta ai docenti rendere efficaci le nuove disposizioni
9151783 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9151784 e necessario che anche la regione toscana nella sua veste di soggetto istituzionale coinvolto nellapprovazione del progetto della terza corsia autostradale faccia completamente la sua parte per quanto attiene la verifica delle modalit di realizzazione sia della nuova galleria del melarancio nel tratto fra certosa e scandicci che dellintero tratto autostradale in fase di realizzazione attorno a firenze
9151785 gli interessi in gioco non sono infatti di rilevanza esclusivamente locale afferma ma riguardano lintera viabilit a livello regionale e addirittura nazionale se infatti la tempistica dei lavori e la stessa fattibilit del progetto divenissero incerti si rischierebbe veramente di tagliare in due il paese e di arrecare danni incalcolabili alleconomia dellintera area fiorentina e a quella regionale
9151786 a questo punto prosegue carraresi un intervento della regione toscana attraverso i propri uffici e il pieno e tempestivo coinvolgimento di altri soggetti regionali quali lazienda sanitaria e larpat divengono veramente urgenti
9151787 di riferire su quanto accaduto gi nel corso della prima seduta consiliare di settembre
9151788 un deciso intervento affinch ogni ipotesi di cassa integrazione per i dipendenti che rischiano di rimanere inattivi a causa dello stop ai lavori venga limitato ai tempi tecnici strettamente necessari
9151789 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9151790 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9151791 marted scorso sono venuto ad arezzo con lunica premura di aver invitato tutti i membri del comitato provinciale uscente per ringraziarli del lavoro svolto durante le elezioni ai presenti ho illustrato il programma dibattuto nellultima direzione nazionale udc
9151792 la linea politica del partito prosegue quella del segretario cesa e di pier ferdinando casini che ci pone alternativi alla sinistra e non annessi al pdl sicuri di esser la spina dorsale del partito popolare europeo in italia il mio compito come commissario quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale affinch gli organi dinformazione possano porre lattenzione su di unazione politica importante senza dar adito a polemiche strumentali che interessano solo chi le alimenta
9151793 in tal senso spiega abbiamo gi attivato nelle maggiori citt della provincia lapertura dei gazebo per la raccolta delle firme per la reintroduzione del voto di preferenza nella legge elettorale avremo poi la festa nazionale di chianciano terme 11 14 settembre p v che ci vedr protagonisti vista la vicinanza geografica dopodich avvieremo una seria verifica con gli iscritti al fine di giungere alle scadenze elettorali 2009 con una definita compagine politico amministrativa
9151794 non possiamo dunque accettare che qualcuno parli sin dora di alleanze con chicchessia chiarisce pur senza dimenticare che la nostra storia ci vede da sempre in provincia di arezzo alternativi alla sinistra in qualsivoglia amministrazione
9151795 ludc valuta positivamente le aperture che ci vengono a livello locale e regionale dagli esponenti del centro destra ma al di l di quelle non vi sono stati ancora incontri ufficiali giudico prematuro e fuorviante parlare di alleanze politiche in questo momento chi ha voglia di impegnarsi nelludc ha la possibilit di farlo sia nel partito sia nelle amministrazioni locali alla ricerca del bene comune e dellinteresse generale
9151796 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9151797 s al voto di preferenza il giovanile motore del partito
9151798 si propone come motore del partito sul territorio giovani e giovanissimi mettono a disposizione il proprio tempo libero perch credono che questa iniziativa proposta da casini in prima persona possa rafforzare la nostra democrazia in quanto pi autorevole il parlamentare eletto a seguito del voto di preferenza di migliaia di cittadini piuttosto che il parlamentare nominato insindacabile dalle segreterie di partito ridotto troppo spesso di conseguenza al ruolo di yes man
9151799 i gazebo per la raccolta delle firme saranno solo il primo impulso per rodare la macchina del gruppo giovani e raccogliere le prime impressioni delle persone illustrando nel contempo le linee guida del nostro partito che vede giorno dopo giorno premiare la coraggiosa scelta identitaria dello scorso aprile
9151800 del resto aggiunge piersante morandini coordinatore nazionale a margine dellassemblea tenuta in data 25 agosto con i giovani di arezzo lentusiasmo di arezzo contagiante non un caso che proprio ai ragazzi di arezzo richiesto uno sforzo notevole per dare il benvenuto ai giovani di tutta italia alla festa nazionale dellunione di centro che si terr a chianciano terme si dall11 al 14 settembre
9151801 il presidente pierfendinando casini sa di poter trovare nei giovani una locomotiva di entusiasmo e grinta per rinnovare dal basso questa nostra italia
9151802 non certamente casuale la citt sta divenendo sempre pi il capoluogo di tendenza della valdichiana oltre ai numerosi vip che la rendono trendy la citt sta diventando un must anche per i politici italiani indipendentemente dallo schieramento politico naturale quindi che i giovani abbiano scelto una localit cool per mettersi alla prova in vista dellimpegno che li vedr protagonisti a chianciano
9151803 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9151804 sar un presidente ha detto che guarda al futuro e non al passato ma ricordatevi queste elezioni non sono su di me ma riguardano voi tutti
9151805 no a ingresso nel pdl con pd dialogo e non intese
9151806 se lofferta quella di entrare nel pdl noi rispondiamo di no perch ci saremmo gi entrati qualche mese prima delle elezioni e con veltroni dialogo in parlamento punto e basta senza equivoci di natura politica
9151807 e comunque facile prevedere precisa che nella gran parte dei casi sar fisiologico una conferma delle alleanze locali con le forze di centrodestra con le quali c un rapporto che dura da pi di 10 anni
9151808 proprio per questo dice cesa teniamo una posizione distinta dal partito democratico evitando di sovrapporre la collaborazione istituzionale tra le forze dellopposizione con lintese politiche che non ci sono
9151809 rafforzare unarea autonoma e centrale della politica italiana larea occupata finora dalludc e che attraverso la fase costituente si allargher a nuovi soggetti
9151810 quando il governo ci ha prospettato in parlamento alcune questioni che noi ritenevamo utili agli italiani sottolinea cesa abbiamo tenuto un atteggiamento positivo quando invece si trattato di opporci come e accaduto per il dpef abbiamo assunto una posizione critica
9151811 una riforma organica che non sia rivolta contro qualcuno ma guardi agli interessi dei cittadini
9151812 no a ingresso nel pdl con pd dialogo e non intese
9151813 no allingresso nel pdl e con il pd dialogo in parlamento
9151814 rafforzare unarea autonoma e centrale della politica italiana larea occupata finora dalludc e che attraverso la fase costituente si allargher a nuovi soggetti
9151815 sar un presidente ha detto che guarda al futuro e non al passato ma ricordatevi queste elezioni non sono su di me ma riguardano voi tutti
9151816 vista la grande enfasi e nello stesso tempo linconsistenza dei fatti a me attribuiti da panorama dice lex presidente del consiglio che parla subito dopo lintervento in proposito del premier silvio berlusconi non vorrei che lartificiale creazione di questo caso politico alimentasse il tentativo o la tentazione di dare vita nel tempo pi breve possibile ad una legge sulle intercettazioni telefoniche che possa sottrarre alla magistratura uno strumento che in molti casi si dimostrato indispensabile per portare in luce azioni o accadimenti utili allo svolgimento delle funzioni che le sono proprie da parte mia conclude prodi non ho alcuna contrariet al fatto che tutte le mie telefonate siano rese pubbliche
9151817 la pubblicazione di intercettazioni telefoniche riguardanti romano prodi a cui va la mia assoluta solidariet non che lennesima ripetizione di un copione gi visto e grave che ci accada e il parlamento deve sollecitamente intervenire per evitare il perpetuarsi di tali abusi che tanto profondamente incidono sulla vita dei cittadini e sulle libert fondamentali
9151818 no a ingresso nel pdl con pd dialogo e non intese
9151819 no allingresso nel pdl e con il pd dialogo in parlamento
9151820 rafforzare unarea autonoma e centrale della politica italiana larea occupata finora dalludc e che attraverso la fase costituente si allargher a nuovi soggetti
9151821 con profonda gratitudine e grande umilt accetto la nomination per la presidenza degli stati uniti
9151822 a john mccain sta a cuore lamerica il problema che non capisce
9151823 che ciascuno di noi libero di vivere come vuole ma che abbiamo anche lobbligo di trattaci lun laltro con dignit e rispetto
9151824 in quando commander in chief non esiter mai a difendere questa nazione ma invier le truppe solo con una missione chiara e il sacro impegno a fornir loro quanto necessario durante la battaglia e le cure e i benefici che meritano una volta tornati a casa

9151829 la scuola ha detto deve rimettere al centro la persona e preparare i ragazzi ad essere cittadini consapevoli dei diritti e dei doveri e conoscitori dei principi costituzionali
9151830 crediamo che alla scuola serva chiarezza ha spiegato il ministro per questo ci sar un ritorno dei voti accompagnati dai giudizi che saranno esplicativi del risultato raggiunto dai ragazzi
9151831 il consiglio dei ministri ha espresso parere favorevole in merito al ritorno al maestro unico per la scuola primaria ha detto il ministro il provvedimento sar contenuto nel piano programmatico per la scuola contenuto nella finanziaria e su cui stiamo lavorando con il ministro tremonti
9151832 this isnt the way we do things in st paul
9151833 i dont want the city to get sucked into something that the sheriffs office is concocting
9151834 we only board up buildings that are vacant and ramshackle the fire inspector has no idea whats going on he hadnt been called the person who is on 24 7 call was not called i talked to him trying to find out who did issue that order and why
9151835 practical date selection methods incl xkdg w 12 hr video
9151836 echt niet ik bedoel je raakt mogelijk gefrustreerd als je een transfer denkt te gaan maken maar het ketst toch af ik heb deze zomer qua gevoel nooit tussen twee clubs in gezeten er is simpelweg niets voorbij gekomen dat ik interessant genoeg vind om ajax voor in te ruilen natuurlijk zou ik ook wel naar real madrid willen wie niet maar in een tussenstap ben ik nu niet ge nteresseerd
9151837 in de grote buitenlandse competities zal de weerstand inderdaad hoger zijn dan hier maar het wordt ook wel overdreven hoor als we met ajax tegen sunderland spelen of met heerenveen tegen newcastle united raak ik niet ondersteboven van het niveau wedstrijden zoals chelsea manchester united en liverpool arsenal zijn niet maatgevend voor lles in engeland
9151838 ik ben er de speler niet naar om in de middenmoot of subtop te tekenen omd t het in een groot voetballand is
9151839 ik ken mezelf ik ben daar veel te ambitieus voor en als spits ook het type dat zoveel mogelijk in en rond de 16 meter moet spelen sport gaat voor mij puur om de top de hoge pieken en diepe dalen die je daar meemaakt en de heftige emoties die ermee samenhangen ik wil spelen daar waar het leven zit en bij ajax de top in nederland is dat het geval
9151840 oranje zag er goed uit was heel solide en stabiel kreeg veel kansen en had makkelijk kunnen winnen
9151841 natuurlijk denk je hadden we in zwitserland niet kunnen winnen maar het is heel moeilijk vergelijken omdat de russen op het ek in goede vorm waren en een oefenduel niet te vergelijken is met de wedstrijd op het ek
9151842 ik had dingen achteraf niet anders gedaan voor de zaak boulahrouz was geen jurisprudentie wij speelden een slechte wedstrijd en hij wilde graag in actie komen de ploeg en technische staf stonden daarachter
9151843 no a ingresso nel pdl con pd dialogo e non intese
9151844 no allingresso nel pdl e con il pd dialogo in parlamento
9151845 rafforzare unarea autonoma e centrale della politica italiana larea occupata finora dalludc e che attraverso la fase costituente si allargher a nuovi soggetti
9151846 svendita ad air france che il governo prodi intendeva realizzare
9151847 creare una alitalia nuova una compagnia aerea pi efficiente finanziariamente in equilibrio tecnologicamente avanzata
9151848 almeno allinizio ci sono da fare dei sacrifici perch le passate gestioni dellalitalia non possono essere cancellate con un colpo di bacchetta magica
9151849 si deve procedere a un ridimensionamento del personale il cui numero attuale non compatibile con una gestione economicamente sana dellazienda
9151850 il personale in eccedenza si trover in una situazione su cui riteniamo di dovere noi intervenire non sar certo abbandonato perch non giusto che siano i singoli a pagare gli errori delle gestioni del passato e non saranno abbandonati neppure i piccoli risparmiatori che in alitalia hanno creduto investendo in titoli azionari ed obbligazionari della compagnia
9151851 se la nuova compagnia aerea dovesse ritenere utile allearsi con una compagnia straniera questa potr entrare solo come socio di minoranza
9151852 in condizioni meno favorevoli per litalia per i lavoratori i consumatori e gli azionisti
9151853 e facile fare i miracoli con i soldi degli italiani scaricando il buco dellalitalia sulle spalle dei cittadini
9151854 per valutare limpatto che il nuovo piano di ristrutturazione di alitalia avr sulla citt di roma
9151855 c un insieme di strumenti legislativi ammortizzatori sociali in gestione al ministero del lavoro che sono pi che sufficienti a risolvere il problema
9151856 duh how can you not tell from my holy moley disposition
9151857 dollar hegemony enables the us to own indirectly but essentially the entire global economy by requiring its wealth to be denominated in fiat dollars that the us can print at will with little in the way of monetary penalties
9151858 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
9151859 in the three months from april to june banks posted their second worst earnings performance since 1991 earnings for the quarter totaled just 5 billion compared with 36 8 billion a year ago a decline of 86 5
9151860 financial institutions will have to pay off at least 787 billion in floating rate notes and other medium term obligations before the end of 2009
9151861 but these instructors teachers in a general sense personnel who trained others to work on the supplied military equipment are supposed to be in training centers and where were they in the military operations zone
9151862 why did the senior us leadership allow their citizens to be present there when they had no right to be in the security zone and if they allowed it i begin to suspect that it was done intentionally to organise a small victorious war
9151863 and if that failed they wanted to create an enemy out of russia and unite voters around one of the ruling party candidate because it is only the ruling party that has this kind of resource
9151864 we have long ago recognised the borders of modern day ukraine
9151865 we have an agreement with ukraine about maintaining the presence of our fleet until the year 2017 and we will implement that agreement
9151866 if i were to say that we dont care that we were indifferent i would be lying
9151867 of course will leave these positions where we are now we will not remain there forever
9151868 our goal is only to provide security in the region
9151869 no moral right to the role of mentor in matters of international relations and to judge the actions of other states

9151873 its time we catch up with the resk of the online gaming business community and offer solid fringe benefits for our valued employees this new package will come at no cost to employees and will be underwritten by a solid insurance company the premium charge will be higher but were banking on the fact that online gaming product sales will increase because our workers will be highly motivated to come to work each day
9151874 once insurance companies buy into the online business sector theyre going to need able legal representation to avoid false claims likewise online gaming businesses will need legal representation against these big time insurance companies in order to get the disbursements they deserve im excited about the possibilities
9151875 wed rather have a consistent share value over time versus a catastrophic loss of company value due to some frivalous lawsuit or liable charges the result of this decision will probably mean a 5 loss in share value for 6 months but then a slow steady recovery after that
9151876 we believe we have a right to the same protections afforded to offline businesses despite the fact that we dont have a physical place of business
9151877 because they currently have a limited health and dental plan we want to give them the most benefits and protect possible because they are our greatest assets people forget that the cost of losing an employee to another online gaming company sometimes outweighs the cost of keeping them onboard
9151878 were already researching able counsel for labor union related insurance claimes
9151879 because we dont want to get screwed in the event an insurance claim is denied to a respective business
9151880 just as we study car home or life insurance we will be studying online business insurance well be using special mathematic models to figure out the risk that online gaming businesses bear against what would be deemed a reasonable insurance premium
9151881 since the business ostensibly operates as a whole in cyberspace
9151882 we have spent so many resources trying to create reliable rng software using traditional algorithms and caculi theorems but have never really analyzed geometric proofs and associated logic as a means to perfect our efforts

9151886 in the past weve worked hard with many sportsbooks but now realize our strengths are found in the digital gaming sector with specific success with online casinos as the year continues to progress well be sure to keep ahead of all new advancements
9151887 we believe there may be an isolated number of products that are affected however we are recalling the entire australian product line as there can be no compromise when it comes to product quality or the health and safety of our consumers
9151888 we will not be shipping any more of this product until we have addressed the issue
9151889 we believe the problem is limited to a small number of products but we have recalled the whole product range just to be cautious

9151894 its just a matter of time before the rebels morph into wake forest
9151895 our defense came out very strong and i think the scoreboard shows what we can do
9151896 we watched film on them we knew every single set they were going to come out in and we had our defensive plays ready for the certain plays they run thats how we came out and dominated
9151897 they scored about 140 points in their last three games so shutting out a team that has that much firepower is great for our defense
9151898 it was just a matter of all the new faces getting in there and gelling and understanding the game plan our kids stepped it up they say between your first game and your second game is where you make the most improvement
9151899 i just want to go out there and play my hardest whether its safety or quarterback or both

9152080 this will create additional tension and the russian president said that offering nato membership to georgia and ukraine two former soviet republics would only aggravate the situation
9152081 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a new cold war but we dont want one and in this situation everything depends on the position of our partners

9152085 in the world of pop music there is michael jackson and there is everybody else
9152086 at some point thriller stopped selling like a leisure item like a magazine a toy tickets to a hit movie and started selling like a household staple
9152087 the fallout from thriller has given the music business its best years since the heady days of 1978 when it had an estimated total domestic revenue of 4 1 billion
9152088 the ruins of punk and the chic regions of synthesizer pop
9152089 star of records radio rock video a one man rescue team for the music business a songwriter who sets the beat for a decade a dancer with the fanciest feet on the street a singer who cuts across all boundaries of taste and style and color too
9152090 the moonwalk that he made famous is an apt metaphor for his dance style how does he do it as a technician he is a great illusionist a genuine mime his ability to keep one leg straight as he glides while the other bends and seems to walk requires perfect timing
9152091 i think its dodgy to do things like that to be someones friend and then buy the rug theyre standing on
9152092 im an alien from mars and i eat live chickens and do a voodoo dance at midnight
9152093 oh man that michael jackson is nuts hes cracked up you cant believe a damn word that comes out of his mouth
9152094 if i go through with this i win big time theres no way i lose i will get everything i want and they will be destroyed forever michaels career will be over
9152095 i believed he didnt do anything wrong and that he was wrongly accused and yes i started falling for him i wanted to save him i felt that i could do it
9152096 if i asked you to marry me would you do it
9152097 ultimately the record runs too long losing steam halfway through its not enough to make invincible the comeback jackson needed but it does offer a reminder that he can really craft good pop
9152098 his skills seem undiminished his funk is steelier and his ballads are airier both to disquieting effect at 78 minutes this is too long
9152099 jacksons truly ugly public scandal and swirling rumors about his diminishing finances

9152104 its been the best of times the worst of times
9152105 descended ever so slightly from boy soprano to his current androgynous high tenor
9152106 jacksons feathery timbered tenor is extraordinary beautiful it slides smoothly into a startling falsetto thats used very daringly
9152107 he gulps for breath his voice quivers with anxiety or drops to a desperate whisper hissing through clenched teeth
9152108 the grace the aggression the growling the natural boyishness the falsetto the smoothness that combination of elements mark him as a major vocalist
9152109 mark had written the treatment and the general idea was that michael and janet were on this large spacecraft and they were alone they were getting away from earth and the different sets were the different environments on the spacecraft where they could have a little bit of fun and where they could relax

9152124 zelo sem zadovoljna z igro e posebej pa me veseli kako sem odigrala v najte jih in klju nih trenutkih ponosna sem da mi je dvoboj uspelo zaklju iti pogumno in odlo no odlo itev da ne nastopim na olimpijskih igrah se je pokazala za pravilno z biljano sva si zadali cilj da najbolj o formo dose em prav v new yorku e pa bi igrala v pekingu bi to pomenilo da bi v mesecu igrala na turnirjih na treh celinah kar ne bi bilo v redu ogromno je takih ki imajo prav zaradi tega tu te ave predvsem jim nagaja asovna razlika

9152127 all of it im the general manager so if you want we can clear this out of the way this is not a joe girardi issue
9152128 i think girardis done a tremendous job given what has occurred
9152129 and he continues to try to remain upbeat with this coaching staff to try to keep these players up and to try to perform up to their abilities
9152130 thats frustrating for all of us but the buck stops right here with me my job is to put it together my job is to fix whats broken i just believe were better than this
9152131 the financials had a very good week particularly the earnings of the big six banks
9152132 were going into a long weekend and im sure there are some people just straightening off their books before heading off
9152133 we are keeping our inventories tightly in line with projected market demand
9152134 the u s market continues to be a challenge and we are keeping a close eye on inventory levels
9152135 the situation is not so much a reflection of the market for small suvs but the downturn in the u s economy
9152136 people in the u s are simply not buying big ticket items like household appliances and cars
9152137 with both crude and total oil product inventories running significantly lower than they were when either hurricanes katrina or rita sidelined gulf oil production both oil and gasoline prices are more exposed to potential storm related supply disruptions than they were three years ago
9152138 the question is whether demand destruction can keep pace with the destruction in supply
9152139 lasting impacts from hurricane damage on future supply growth as there have already been from the 2005 storm season
9152140 the general trend to gasoline prices would be flat to slightly lower reflecting a sort of underlying slowing global growth and therefore a slowdown in demand
9152141 if gustav hits hard then gasoline could take the cue and start rising
9152142 this transaction is consistent with iamgolds strategy of rationalizing our structure and significantly reducing cash costs at all of our operations
9152143 as expected the pace of economic activity remains slow as a result of the u s slowdown and its impact on our exports sector
9152144 through most of this period of economic uncertainty canadas economic fundamentals remain solid
9152145 stephen harper and jim flaherty continue to talk about how good the fundamentals are in canada in spite of the fact that by any economic definition canada is slumping
9152146 he can no longer blame the united states for canadas economic problems
9152147 yes we avoided a technical recession in terms of the back to back quarterly contractions but if we take the first quarter downward revision to the estimate for gdp growth combined with the disappointing second quarter number then the overall result is the economy contracted in the first half of the year as a whole
9152148 having missed on their gdp estimates means that a slack in the canadian economy opened up at a faster pace than they expected
9152149 that eases up on some of the inflationary pressures and allows them to focus more on the deteriorating economy
9152150 based on the dimensions provided the cabinet was built with 70 inches of clearance but the actual fridge delivered to our kitchen was 71 inches she said
9152151 what is the store going to do about misinformation at the website
9152152 take your tape measure to the store and get the dimensions from your model dont trust dimensions the retailer or manufacturer give to you
9152153 finalizing an account results in the closure of one account at the address and opening a new one at the same address
9152154 from then on bills were sent to her address in the name of another person no additional payments for continued gas use were withdrawn from ms moars account
9152155 we regret that this error was not identified until after collections activity had taken place and the gas service had been terminated
9152156 however they should have thought to call the previous customer on the account the ombudsmans office will be following up on this
9152157 we are sending a letter to apologize for the inconvenience it will include a gift certificate as a gesture of goodwill
9152158 virgin doesnt even fly to toronto and british airways special flight cost each of them 2 346 one way
9152159 thats just not going to happen we dont have the money
9152160 the company is in the process of determining its next course of action in its reorganization
9152161 at this time it is uncertain whether or not any flights will be resumed or the status of any refunds due passengers who have pre paid flights
9152162 normally what happens is theres smoke and the system doesnt work but in rare cases there could be a fire
9152163 its a very simple and fast fix and isnt all that inconvenient to owners especially at this time of year
9152164 supporting a family on my job at the middle eastern gaming policy corporation is difficult because i dont have the experience to move up the ladder yet
9152165 with the recent boom in the middle eastern gaming policy market were looking to hire 100 new employees in a range of different jobs
9152166 we believe this time gives us an opportunity to evaluate new hires and decide if we made the right decision in offering them work if they dont pass this temporary evaluation period we offer the job to anyone on our waiting list
9152167 our hr department is by far the largest unit at voorheis gibbons inc
9152168 and rightly so with stock par values increasing by the month we need more and more hirees to satisfy our growing corportate needs
9152169 and we realize that as a result we provide new middle eastern gaming policy business hirees with substantial benefits to stay onboard and grow their career with us
9152170 we also want highly motivated individuals with a background in middle eastern gaming policy marketing on the internet
9152171 mostly because our internet sales division is booming and we need to explore all marketing opportunities within this important medium
9152172 this test is not meant to scare off prospective hirees
9152173 but we want to see how they can apply the skills they have to the real life needs of written communication and critical thinking
9152174 the big thing in the funeral industry these days is personalization
9152175 people want the process and memorial to reflect the person they lost
9152176 the largest blue diamond we make is 1 carat and we limit the colorless diamonds to 50 carats
9152177 i know some of the services are a strait up scam
9152178 what if you donate your body but do not have a service
9152179 my mother donated her body in 1992 and had to be embalmed in a certain way and that cost us 800 and took 4 years for her ashes to be returned
9152180 to investigate the circumstances and events surrounding the termination of former public safety commissioner monegan and potential abuses of power and or improper actions by members of the executive branch
9152181 todd and sarah are scratching their heads why on earth hasnt this why is this guy still representing the department hes a horrible recruiting tool you know
9152182 lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate
9152183 but that excitement must not stop here in denver weve got to exceed everything weve done to elect him president of the united states
9152184 we have to keep working im not going to stop for a moment
9152185 we need an america that puts barney smith before smith barney
9152186 it said to us youve got to look out for your neighbors
9152187 he showed by his own lifes story that he was not the exotic interloper that mccain portrayed
9152188 he didnt take the offense and got himself put on the defensive
9152189 stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
9152190 he obama is our leader now and he is going after mccain in any and every way he can
9152191 thats what i needed him to say that he is going to be a fighter
9152192 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
9152193 we expect very shortly within 24 to 48 hours we will have our proposal
9152194 increasing taxes will only put more californians out of work and delay the economic recovery
9152195 i want people here to know that im going to be fighting as hard as i can for them and joe biden is going to be fighting as hard as he can for them to create new jobs in high growth industries like clean energy
9152196 you cant get much better than joe biden hes a good man
9152197 speaking her own mind and then worrying about whether its popular afterward
9152198 ive got a secret weapon up my sleeve but obviously im not going to tell everyone what it is therell be someone playing at left back ill tell you that much

9152202 just seeing obama on stage i cried my eyelashes off
9152203 it changed my life i feel like im going to do better and work harder
9152204 i thought the next thing to do would be to make a sculpture of the person whos the ideal beauty of the moment
9152205 ill just have a little cake with my children and well probably watch some cartoons
9152206 i think the best is yet to come in my true humble opinion

9152221 one of the most distinguished of german physicians a practical physician of matured experience and reflection
9152222 i could not conscientiously treat the unknown morbid conditions of my suffering brethren by these unknown medicines which being very active substances may unless applied with the most rigorous exactness which the physician cannot exercise because their peculiar effects have not yet been examined so easily occasion death or produce new affections and chronic maladies often more difficult to remove than the original disease
9152223 to become thus the murderer or the tormentor of my brethren was to me an idea so frightful and overwhelming that soon after my marriage i renounced the practice of medicine that i might no longer incur the risk of doing injury and i engaged exclusively in chemistry and in literary occupations
9152224 but i became a father serious diseases threatened my beloved children my flesh and blood my scruples redoubled when i saw that i could afford them no certain relief
9152225 that i was called upon to admit in the practice of medicine a great deal that was not proved
9152226 if i was called to attend a patient i was to collect his symptoms and next to infer from these symptoms that a certain internal condition of the organs existed and then to select such a remedy as the medical authorities asserted would be useful under such circumstances
9152227 but it is very evident that the argument is most inconclusive and that room was thus left for many curious errors and so i determined to investigate the whole matter for myself from the very beginning
9152228 ii numerous observations have shown that by the general use of belladonna epidemics of scarlet fever have actually been arrested belladonna was insufficient to prevent infection the disease has been invariably slight

9152261 deber an saber que en andaluc a se hablaba una lengua llamada moz rabe que desapareci cuando la reconquista pero si de la segunda pregunta intuyo que intentan colegir o pretenden insinuar que el andaluz proviene de una lengua propia derivada del lat n que se trata de una lengua romance apaga y v monos apaga y v monos

9152280 dentro del terreno un tanto inseguro de nuestros conocimientos del cante flamenco lo nico evidente y que apenas necesita discusi n es que el fen meno se inscribe entre coordenadas geogr ficas precisas geogr fica y gen ticamente hablando el cante es un fen meno estrictamente andaluz el cante flamenco est ligado al terru o con fuerza bot nica y de la tierra prende su savia y vigor

9152282 ya torn ies a vuestro librixa no os tengo dicho que como aquel hombre no era castellano sino andaluz hablava y escriv a como en el andaluz a y no como en castilla vos no veis que aunque librixa era muy docto en la lengua latina que esto nadie se lo puede quitar al fin no se puede negar que era andaluz y no castellano y que escrivi aquel su vocabulario con tan poco cuidado que parece averlo escrito por burla en la declaraci n que haze de los vocablos castellanos en los latinos se enga a tantas vezes que sois for ado a creer una de dos cosas o que no entend a la verdadera significaci n del lat n y esta es la que yo menos creo o que no alcan ava la del castellano y esta podr a ser porque l era de andaluz a donde la lengua no est muy pura
9152283 no basta querer una cosa es preciso estudiar el modo de conseguirla y saber cu l es la acci n m s eficaz para la liberaci n del pueblo andaluz
9152284 las variantes sint cticas pros dicas y sustantivas o de nombres del lenguaje andaluz le determinan como un organismo en evoluci n particularizante como un dialectal r pidamente formado del castellano no tan castellano como pudiera parecer pues el romance se inici en andaluc a como lo tiene demostrado en sus estudios don juli n ribera a los andaluces les prohibieron los conquistadores hablar su lengua hasta en el recinto familiar y emplear su alfabeto pero el pueblo conquistado sigui usando de sus particulares sonidos articu lizantes de los cuales no se les pudo despojar porque para esto hubiera sido preciso suprimirle o injertarle la garganta y empez en seguida a transformar el idioma del conquistador adapt ndolo a sus condiciones diferentes fisiol gicas y ps quicas tal vez se encontrase una prueba complementaria del nacimiento del romance en andaluc a en el hecho estudiado por el sabio patriarca de nuestra hermandad don mario m ndez bejarano de ser precisamente la prosodia andaluza la que se transmite al propagar dicho idioma a las regiones principalmente de ultramar

9152291 el hecho de pertenecer el alumnado andaluz a una regi n dialectal dentro del mbito del espa ol no deber a representar en teor a ninguna situaci n especial puesto que todos los hablantes del espa ol andaluces toledanos leoneses tinerfe os cubanos chilenos son hablantes dialectales
9152292 en este sentido incluso desde lo estrictamente ling stico se ha afirmado que la causa de nuestro exagerado evolucionismo fon tico podr a ser la pereza articulatoria del hombre andaluz quiz ocasionada por el clima y la psicolog a
9152293 desde la ling stica no est n del todo claros los conceptos de lengua y dialecto ya que ambos son definidos desde perspectivas muy diversas y a veces con criterios extraling sticos no obstante ling istas y dialect logos suelen estar de acuerdo en que el andaluz no es una lengua desde un punto de vista diacr nico gen tico el andaluz es un dialecto del castellano desde un punto de vista sincr nico el andaluz en el momento actual es una variedad una modalidad ling stica del espa ol la lengua de los andaluces es la lengua espa ola por consiguiente no se podr a hablar de dialecto

9152301 es vieja y bizantina la discusi n de lo que son idiomas o dialectos cuando un idioma produce literatura es idioma y cuando no la produce es dialecto dicen algunos cuando un idioma se ha desgajado de otro m s antiguo es dialecto dicen otros en el fondo la diferencia entre dialecto e idioma viene a ser m s cuesti n pol tica y econ mica que cuesti n ling stica un dialecto del lat n pasa a ser idioma por razones de independencia pol tica de su territorio un idioma pasa a ser dialecto cuando se a sla y conserva en un rinc n separado mientras que otro en mayor dinamismo se enriquece y evoluciona dejemos pues estos bizantinismos y concret monos a decir que el andaluz no es dialecto en el sentido de hijo del castellano porque posee muchos elementos ajenos al castellano tanto en su fon tica como en su sintaxis y en su vocabulario
9152302 quien vive en una regi n habla un dialecto el que vive en una naci n habla un idioma

9152360 keterlibatan seorang anggota dalam kenisah rakyat tidak dimulai di jonestown tapi jauh lebih awal daripada itu dekat dengan rumah mereka pribadi dan tidak sedramatis di jonestown awalnya anggota anggota itu mendatangi pertemuan pertemuan secara sukarela dan menyempatkan diri beberapa jam setiap minggu bekerja di gereja jim jones meskipun anggota anggota lama akan mengajak anggota baru untuk bergabung tapi mereka bisa bebas memilih untuk tetap tinggal atau pergi jika mau bergabung maka anggota itu akan lebih bertekad setia pada kenisah rakyat sedikit sedikit jones menambah perintahnya pada setiap anggota setelah lama jadi anggota barulah jones mulai meningkatkan sikapnya yang menindas dan tuntutan tuntutan dalam pesan pesannya sedikit demi sedikit pilihan lain bagi anggota dikurangi langkah demi langkah orang itu tergerak untuk melogiskan pengabdiannya dan membenarkan perbuatannya
9152361 setiap kali aku menceritakan pada seseorang tentang masa enam tahunku menjadi anggota kenisah rakyat aku menghadapi pertanyaan yang tidak bisa kujawab jika gereja itu sedemikian jelek mengapa dong kau dan keluargamu tetap jadi anggota untuk waktu yang sangat lama
9152362 beberapa pengamatan lama dari penyelidikan kejiwaan sosial tentang proses pembenaran diri dan teori penerimaan hal yang tidak disetujui cognitive dissonance dapat menjelaskan perbuatan yang tampaknya tidak rasional
9152363 hatinya tergerak melihat adegan orang orang segala bangsa menyembah pada tuhan
9152364 orangtua john senang melihat anaknya menemukan sesuatu yang menarik hatinya pada jaman itu orangtua lain yang mereka kenal bergulat dengan masalah anak anak mereka yang terlibat obat bius ngebut minum hal ini membuat mereka mengira ketertarikan anak mereka terhadap islam bukanlah masalah apapun ibu john yang bernama marilyn biasa mengantar anaknya ke mesjid untuk sembahyang jumat di petang hari seorang muslim akan mengantar john pulang
9152365 ini dianggap sebagai anak muda mencoba sesuatu yang baru dalam hidupnya dalam diri rohaninya dan ini tentunya bukan hal yang mengerikan atau layak dibenci

9152369 menurut teori disonan pertentangan ketika seseorang melakukan tindakan atau mempercayai hal yang tidak disetujuinya yang bertentangan dengan apa yang dipikirkannya maka pertentangan ini mengakibatkan ketegangan yang tidak menyenangkan orang ini lalu akan mencoba mengurangi pertentangan dan biasanya dengan cara mengubah kelakukannya agar sesuai dengan perbedaan atau kepercayaan tadi beberapa kejadian di kenisah rakyat dapat menerangkan terjadinya proses ini kejadian kejadian mengerikan di jonestown tidak terjadi hanya karena ancaman ancaman belaka dan tidak terjadi tiba tiba hal ini tidak terjadi karena orang orang lepas kontrol atau hilang ingatan yang mengkibatkan mereka melakukan hal hal yang tidak waras yang terjadi adalah seperti yang dijelaskan dalam teori disonan kognitif yakni orang orang membenarkan pilihan dan tekad mereka sendiri sama seperti air terjun raksasa dimulai dari beberapa tetes saja maka perbuatan ekstrim dan musibah besar dalam terjadi melalui sikap setuju untuk melakukan perbuatan perbuatan sepele yang tampaknya tak berarti dalam kenisah rakyat prosesnya dimulai dengan menjalani pengurungan diri dan hanya bergabung bersama gereja jones saja hal ini ditambah pula dengan kecenderungan membenarkan tekad dan tindakan dirinya
9152370 ambilah contoh calon anggota datang pertama kali ke kenisah rakyat jika seorang mengalami awal yang sulit untuk diterima dalam sebuah kelompok maka orang ini cenderung mengira kelompok ini menarik hati agar membenarkan dirinya dalam menjalani banyak kesusahan dalam kelompok ini
9152371 kami mulai menyukai pertemuan pertemuan yang berlangsung lama melelahkan karena kami diberitahu bahwa pertumbuhan rohani datang dari pengorbanan diri sendiri
9152372 begitu terlibat seorang anggota harus menghabiskan waktu dan tenaga yang semakin banyak bagi kenisah rakyat
9152373 kami harus menghadapi kenyataan menyakitkan uang tabungan simpanan kami habis jim menuntut kami menjual asuransi jiwa kami dan menyerahkan uangnya kepada gereja jadi kami tidak punya apa apa semua kekayaan kami sudah diambil impian kami pergi melakukan misi ke luar negeri pupus sudah kami kira kami tidak mau berhubungan lagi dengan orang tua kami ketika menyatakan hendak meninggalkan negeri ini bahkan anak anak yang kami tinggal dan diurus oleh carol dan bill juga terang terangan memusuhi kami jim berhasil melakukan semua ini dalam waktu singkat saja yang akhirnya kami miliki hanya jim dan alasan utama saja jadi kami berkeputusan untuk bersiap memberi semua kekuatan kami untuk kedua hal itu

9152409 even if the use of the taser by the police cannot be considered to be the medical cause of death it is apparent that considering he was in an agitated and intoxicated state receiving several electrical discharges possibly contributed to his death
9152410 all we feel is that if we have our questions answered and we have the policemens version we will feel a little bit better
9152411 it still wont bring quilem back but if we have justice then maybe we will feel a little bit better

9152422 we have brought up several of our concerns which we see incorporated in this

9152456 the new system would be a continuation of our phased approach to gulf coast market access which has the objectives of minimizing capital cost and financial commitments required of shippers maximizing use of existing pipelines and rights of way and ensuring attractive producer netbacks
9152457 action comedy which takes a dangerous ride into high crime and low life in contemporary london where real estate has supplanted drugs as the biggest market and criminals are its most enthusiastic entrepreneurs
9152458 with both crude and total oil product inventories running significantly lower than they were when either hurricanes katrina or rita sidelined gulf oil production both oil and gasoline prices are more exposed to potential storm related supply disruptions than they were three years ago
9152459 a comparable hit to production could easily send gasoline prices to new record highs with pump prices in the united states rising to us 5 per gallon and send natural gas prices spiking as well
9152460 the question is whether demand destruction can keep pace with the destruction in supply
9152461 while supply disruptions and attendant price hikes will be temporary there will be lasting impacts from hurricane damage on future supply growth as there have already been from the 2005 storm season
9152462 the general trend to gasoline prices would be flat to slightly lower reflecting a sort of underlying slowing global growth and therefore a slowdown in demand for crude oil
9152463 that should take a further froth off crude oil prices and allow for gasoline prices to slip a bit further
9152464 if there is damage to infrastructure if rigs are offline for more than just a few days for precautionary reasons then you could see oil and gasoline prices move upward temporarily
9152465 one would expect bell and telus to want to be quite aggressive in being able to compete with rogers
9152466 so whats motivating it is wanting to lower the cost of acquiring handsets and accelerate the speed of getting the latest the coolest handsets
9152467 its still a question of how long it takes bell and telus to roll out a comparable network
9152468 so having high end devices is a key aspect of moving over to the new network but there are a lot of drawbacks to doing it
9152469 the key point is not that we escaped a technical recession its to look at the fact that in the first of 2008 the canadian economy contracted
9152470 more importantly it deteriorated at a faster pace than the bank of canada had expected
9152471 every single category of business declined and detracted from growth residential structures non residential structures business machinery and equipment and this is the among the weakest pace of consumer spending weve had in years
9152472 progress continues and we are now planning to submit the environmental impact assessment report and application once there is greater clarity on carbon dioxide regulations and we are able to better align our project with the timing of our potential customers
9152473 we will be reaching out to the provincial government and regulators to discuss some of our concerns
9152474 this just gives us more options just to figure out what is the best thing to meet our potential customers needs
9152475 theres a whole series of our vehicles full seized trucks and some cross overs that have a heated windshield washer system
9152476 the circuit board apparently can short and normally what happens is theres smoke and the system doesnt work but in rare cases there could be a fire
9152477 in rare instances a fire can occur so we want to make sure that our customers are safe
9152478 its a very simple and fast fix and it really isnt all that inconvenient to them especially this time of year
9152479 observe carefully what guides the actions of the wise and what they shun or seek
9152480 were facing a far more balanced market than we did last year
9152481 buyers can afford to be in less of a hurry
9152482 people are putting their homes on the market to take advantage of recent price gains
9152483 when you have double digit price gains on a nationwide basis for several years youre going to have to pay a little bit of that back at some stage
9152484 the trend for new listings generally national and major market reflects recent price trends
9152485 while still elevated new listings in alberta are easing and market balance is stabilizing now that prices there have softened
9152486 thats one of the reasons you have fewer buyers this year just from an affordability standpoint
9152487 looking to move out of real estate at the tailend of a very healthy ride
9152488 we expect that new listings will remain elevated for the rest of the year
9152489 the significant price gains that we saw last year are definitely in the rear view mirror theyll be very modest over the rest of the year and into next
9152490 we are currently analyzing the data gathered during the event to identify the source of the inflow and its implications for planned remediation work
9152491 we do not expect to have any significant new information regarding the inflow until later in the year at the earliest as we will be bringing in other investigative equipment to the site which is not immediately available
9152492 people were very tired and hungry it was frustrating to be able to see the hotel from the airport and to hear drivers say they would not drive there
9152493 ive never heard of anything so ridiculous in my life
9152494 consumers pulled back on real spending in both june and july in the face of weak employment conditions higher energy prices and further declines in household net worth
9152495 therell be another one undoubtedly in the next couple of years but i also think well see some new ones starting up as well almost against common sense
9152496 i know that everyone wants to jump on the bandwagon because of oil prices
9152497 i dont buy that because i can name two dozen airlines that have gone bankrupt in canada when oil was 20 per barrel
9152498 the only attraction theyve got is price and price is the easiest thing to copy
9152499 the financials had a very good week particularly the earnings of the big six banks were definitely better than people were expecting so thats had a nice bid on the markets
9152500 and were going into a long weekend and im sure there are some people just straightening off their books before heading off
9152501 perversion of justice on a remarkable and almost unprecedented scale
9152502 i hope that this action will act as a wake up call
9152503 as i have said before it is not the intention of kuwait airways to take aggressive action for its own sake but in the absence of any meaningful dialogue and in the light of kuwait airways duty to protect public funds iraq airways and iraq can expect further similar action to be taken without further warning
9152504 the re interpretation and eventually eradication of the concept of right and wrong which has been the basis of child training the substitution of intelligent and rational thinking for faith are the belated objectives of practically all effective psychotherapy
9152505 the fact is that most psychiatrists and psychologists and other respectable people have escaped from these moral chains and are able to observe and think freely
9152506 poor souls wandering around in the sewer of health data looking for a speck of clean and useful water
9152507 anyone can do that cant they wear face glitter and sing songs about shit
9152508 congress is already investigating allegations of manipulation in the oil market and it seems likely that it is only a matter of time before a similar investigation will be required in the precious metal markets
9152509 the data in the bank participation report is so clear and compelling that it is hard to conclude anything but manipulation
9152510 one can take any data and make it suit their argument
9152511 the theory that the market is somehow sinisterly manipulated especially as it comes at a time when u s regulators are keeping a keen eye on the goings on in the commodities and financial markets for just such type of evidence is simply ludicrous and totally out of touch with market reality
9152512 my gut feeling is that the republicans wouldnt mind taking oil back down under 100 before the elections
9152513 there is a lot of nervousness especially in energy pits about the efforts underway to propose wrong footed legislation from politicians who want to bring down the price of gasoline
9152514 i dont believe we have a speculative bubble but these moves are going to drive a lot of hot money out of commodities pits between now and the elections
9152515 there is indeed a rational explanation for the decline in the price of gold and silver the dollar has staged one huge rally and fundamentals suggested the dollar should rally
9152516 stand to buy or sell the commodities taking the other side from other people or institutions entering a market
9152517 because investors particularly short term technically oriented funds were selling
9152518 what you have here is the footprints of hedge funds exiting the commodities markets en masse
9152519 they make the markets and take what is coming at them

9152524 when you are up to your neck in alligators it is easy to forget that you came to drain the swamp in the first place
9152525 always go too far because thats where youll find the truth
9152526 reduce the need for them to raise substantially more dilutive capital
9152527 credit losses are going to go up in 2009 but people feel they have far more than enough capital to manage their credit losses
9152528 even with credit losses that high they should generate a profit in 2009
9152529 by the end of this year its going to be pretty clear where the possible worst case scenarios lie for losses
9152530 the biggest problem we have is that in the housing bubble we had all these speculators buying in and people lying on their mortgage applications
9152531 environment volunteers care passionately about their area and want to protect it they are not snoopers they will help councils cut crime and make places cleaner greener and safer

9152538 it happened to my brother an indian citizen with a 10 year multiple entry visa to the us when he arrived in amsterdam from bangalore an immigration official in amsterdam found his visa page torn and as a precaution warned him not to visit the us
9152539 now he is going through the pain of applying for a new american visa the immigration people are crazy it is a huge fraud
9152540 there are certain complaints that are being probed but it is not a scam as it is being alleged

9152609 dhonis return to the team was a boon not only did he lead the side superbly but he played a couple of match winning knocks
9152610 more importantly he handled the dreaded ajantha mendis with ease and in the process he showed his colleagues that mendis could be handled and scored off too
9152611 man to man india were a superior team and they played like one for the last two years or so india have really gone up in the rankings by several notches and thats very heartening
9152612 mind you its tough to beat sri lanka on their home turf as no indian team has done it in the past and thats why it is more satisfying
9152613 i guess mendis was the difference between the two sides

9152617 inflation has hardened further even though the pass through of the rise in international crude oil prices remains incomplete finances of the government are under some stress on account of several factors such as increased pressures from oil fertilisers and food subsidies the farm loan waiver scheme and the hike in wages following the implementation of the sixth pay commission

9152638 the decision ive got to make will be made on the basis of whos best to play against kilmarnock
9152639 what happened on tuesday with the two lads coming in and getting goals has given me even more to think about
9152640 weve got great options so the players who do play know that theres people waiting there ready to step in
9152641 every single game has been hard and playing at tannadice is going to be a tough game
9152642 but we are in good form and hopefully we can get another victory
9152643 winning is good for your confidence a real lift its too soon to say how things will go
9152644 this is only the fourth game of the season and there is still a long way to go we need to just keep playing well and keep our confidence up
9152645 weve played well in the three games weve just been unfortunate not to pick up any points
9152646 if we can get a good performance then we have the international break so we can get the boys back fit i think well then have great options
9152647 weve been missing players but theyre on the way back especially up front
9152648 once the strikers have a few goals in them and get a bit of confidence im sure there will be many more and we can start to kick on
9152649 we made it difficult for ourselves against arbroath but we got there in the end
9152650 in long spells of the game i thought we were very good but it was a cup final for them and they got a massive lift when we let them back into the game on both occasions
9152651 im sure the match at falkirk will be another close encounter but we are looking forward to it

9152660 but what i will not do is suggest that the senator takes his positions for political purposes because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism

9152683 by winning in durban we have presented ourselves with an opportunity to win back to back test matches in south africa which is not only rare in an australian context but is also historically significant across the game in general
9152684 our bowlers bowled well and we fielded well also but we didnt bat well
9152685 i hope that the situation is not so serious as it may have looked
9152686 large scale evacuation will continue til all the marooned people are rescued in the next three to four days
9152687 we will have to provide food and shelter to the survivors until october as they will not be able to return home
9152688 essential commodities including food are now being transported by boat
9152689 we have been stuck here for the past 10 days with no rescue team reaching here our food and water stocks have run out our mobiles phones are working but they too will fail any moment
9152690 we have absolutely nothing with us here we left everything behind
9152691 there is hardly any chance that musharraf will ever be tried in pakistan
9152692 im not saying he didnt deserve it im saying he did everything he could do to win those golds and he came away with it but at the same time there were little mistakes by other people that allowed him to do that
9152693 the keyboard is mightier than the sword even a blogger can no longer tolerate the quality of governance that the country is having now
9152694 a lot of people have come alive in the last 10 years theyre the reformasi generation and they think about politics in fundamentally different ways
9152695 i think a lot of people feel that jeff oois following has diminished because of his direct participation in politics

9152697 the boat was overcrowded because people panicked to be rescued and clambered on board
9152698 we cant assess the extent of the damage it is colossal

9152700 they are desperate because of defeats in the northern front lines and are targeting civilians
9152701 doctors say he has no physical health problems except that he is physically exhausted
9152702 extremely important non violent action taken by tibetans under the leadership of the dalai lama in a very critical period for tibet particularly the post olympic period
9152703 this is not a protest led by hatred rancour and anger but by the teachings of the lord buddha to refrain from harming others
9152704 our condolence and homage to those who lost their lives and those who were imprisoned tortured and beaten in the recent uprisings in tibet
9152705 but what i believe is that we have to work together to find out what the facts are before we make public announcements
9152706 i am going to make an offer to the government and the united nations to participate in a joint investigation with the coalition to continue to look at the facts surrounding these allegations and to make sure that we have come as close as we can to everybody knowing the truth of what happened in azizabad
9152707 the distinctions between different parts of the coalition are perhaps understood by the coalition
9152708 but they are not understood necessarily by the media and by the afghan population
9152709 we regret the loss of civilian life but the numbers that we find on this target area are nowhere near the number reported in the media and we believe there was a very deliberate information operation orchestrated by the insurgency by the taliban
9152710 they are refugees now because they have left their homes they are living in the forests and they should be brought back
9152711 it is the responsibility of the government that these refugees should be brought back and also to send for force if necessary to stop this killing to stop this burning to stop this looting
9152712 i express spiritual closeness and solidarity to the brothers and sisters in faith who are being so harshly tested
9152713 a strict curfew is in force please stay indoors and dont come out for congregational prayers
9152714 hezbollah succeeded in incorporating the idea of resistance as part of the international anti globalization movements
9152715 through our contacts with these groups we have managed to challenge the idea that hezbollah is a dogmatic terrorist islamist organization and convince part of the international left that we can be a strong partner
9152716 we think of the sacrifices of all the militants in lebanon and palestine and the arab world from islamists to nationalists to arabists or any ideological background they come from
9152717 hezbollah is aware today of the importance of cultivating contacts with the west
9152718 social forums are open spaces of discussion they present an opportunity for a group like hezbollah to participate and give their opinions
9152719 it was a potent symbol that right makes might and that a guerrilla ready to fight for its people can succeed
9152720 some leftist groups refuse to consider what islamist organizations are about their oppressive practices their violations of rights their dogmatic rhetoric
9152721 there would be only two people of working age for every person aged 65 or more in 2060 compared with four persons to one today

9152723 she wanted the public to know that they had nothing to fear about the future of the dairy she was excited at the time and was looking forward to the prospects for the dairy in private hands as it was at the time being readied for auction
9152724 long standing practice is that we are allowed to use our judgment when determining whether an activity has merit for travel purposes we do not have limits established for these costs
9152725 i have a contract with real madrid now but we are still negotiating with chelsea
9152726 a lot of things are being published and they are not the truth it is not true that i said that i was going to apologise for my conduct to the press
9152727 i dont know about robinho because it is not my job to enter into talks about players
9152728 i said something to chief executive peter kenyon a month ago and they tried to bring robinho here but my job is on the pitch
9152729 if they can bring him here it will be down to board meetings and i have to think about tottenham not about whether players have come or have not come
9152730 there is no question of cosmetic or otherwise what we are really asking is there are certain issues on which there are certain red lines drawn by us because those are the commitments that had been made by our prime minister
9152731 on red lines we cannot thats what we told our parliament that these are sacrosanct and if these are not met we cannot endorse the agreement
9152732 we have always made the point that testing is a word that we find difficult to adjust to not because of anything else but because that is what parliament has mandated us to do
9152733 i presume testing will be difficult for us to so we will find ways around it we are clear that whatever we finally agree to in nsg should be something that we can sell to parliament

9152748 thats where apple with their iphone app store seems to have really struck a nerve theyve made it incredibly easy for users of the device to get at the applications

9152757 its a shame because the vespa px is a design classic my generation has grown up with it
9152758 go and see maha brahma who is the powerful one
9152759 i cannot remove this coil the only one who can remove this coil is the person who put it on you
9152760 yes i can do that under two conditions said upagupta
9152761 the first is that you must promise not to disturb buddhist devotees any more in the future the second is that you must show me the real image of buddha because i know that you have seen him on many occasions but i have never seen him i would like to see the real buddha image exactly like him with the special thirty two characteristics of his physical body
9152762 if i change myself into the image of the buddha you must promise that you will not worship me because i am not a holy person like you
9152763 you promised you would not worship me now why do you worship me
9152764 i am not worshipping you you must understand i am worshipping the buddha
9152765 we havent scored in our last four there so it doesnt look good
9152766 im thinking more about the ryder cup than this to be honest with you
9152767 im trying to get my game ready for that being my first ryder cup i want to play well and represent our country to the best of my ability
9152768 if we win that would be great if not at least i go there and had a great time knowing that i gave it my all thats all you can do
9152769 my game is in pretty good form so if i try to focus on being 100 percent for the ryder cup it doesnt mean that im going to play bad these next few weeks
9152770 it just means that maybe my focus is more down the road
9152771 im playing well and my goal this week was just to make the cut because ive had great success here in the past
9152772 hes had no pre season games and i have no estimate as to when he may play
9152773 as far as i know hes in pretty good nick he had just picked up a calf strain in training
9152774 thats not far away from being ok yes hes had problems and if he had been playing every game we wouldnt have got him for next to nothing
9152775 there will be some money after hes played games but there is no initial outlay he has to play before we play
9152776 if i can get him out 20 times a season that gives us a chance of winning 20 games
9152777 he said he felt his knee and that he was not fit enough to play
9152778 there is nothing you can to do about it if a player declares himself unfit you have to accept that
9152779 wed have liked to play him and get him back into the run of things and playing football again
9152780 i think the situation is far less serious than what is being portrayed but at the same time certainly something that we are very unhappy about
9152781 i mean people have started comparing it with the 1990s and what not certainly the situation is nowhere around that
9152782 what is causing us concern is that four years of improvement in the situation we believed that we have reduced levels of alienation there were substantial signs of normalcy in the state people had forgotten about issues
9152783 no major concern other than day to day problems of living better electricity internet connection etc suddenly these seem to have been sort of pushed into the background and mobs have come out onto the street
9152784 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
9152785 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
9152786 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
9152787 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
9152788 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
9152789 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
9152790 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
9152791 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
9152792 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
9152793 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
9152794 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
9152795 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
9152796 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
9152797 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
9152798 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
9152799 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
9152800 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
9152801 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
9152802 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
9152803 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
9152804 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
9152805 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
9152806 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
9152807 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
9152808 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

9152812 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
9152813 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
9152814 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
9152815 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
9152816 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
9152817 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
9152818 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
9152819 i just found out im going to do tarantinos next film with brad pitt and im very excited quentin just called
9152820 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
9152821 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
9152822 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
9152823 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
9152824 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
9152825 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
9152826 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
9152827 who are open to doing something on the production side
9152828 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
9152829 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
9152830 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
9152831 i really like you so much and have a lot of respect for you but i would like to marry you and i have a question which side of the bed do you prefer to sleep on
9152832 you are very cute but you know my boyfriend will kill you

9152834 the only person who can possibly reach him is fishburne
9152835 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
9152836 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
9152837 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
9152838 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
9152839 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
9152840 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
9152841 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
9152842 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
9152843 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
9152844 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
9152845 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
9152846 seperti keluarga keluarga yang lain lah sudah siapin menu menunya
9152847 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
9152848 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
9152849 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
9152850 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
9152851 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
9152852 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

9152880 el refer ndum se convierta en uno de los argumentos electorales
9152881 la independencia el plan y el refer ndum no tiene el respaldo de los vascos sea en septiembre o en octubre cuando se pronuncie el tc es la cr nica de un fracaso anunciado que ven todos incluso algunos del pnv pero que no ven ni ibarretxe ni madrazo ni ziarreta porque est n empe ados en tener una excusa electoral y avanzar hacia sus postulados m ximos
9152882 y es el precedente de cuando zapatero llev a europa el proceso de negociaci n con eta y abri camino ahora lo que est haciendo ibarretxe y su gobierno es seguir la senda abierta por zapatero
9152883 al final ir a europa es un descr dito para el pa s vasco para la ciudadan a vasca y para la empresas vascas porque se vende que euskadi es un territorio sin ley
9152884 por tanto indic los que se aliviar n de que eso no salga adelante est n en el pnv pero sin mandar y urkullu es de los que mandan
9152885 los que est n dentro del pnv desde urkullu hasta el ltimo est n en la ruptura los moderados est n casi al margen de la formaci n en una instituci n muy importante o fuera del aparato presidiendo una gran empresa
9152886 en ese escenario de m xima importancia para los populares haremos todo lo que est en nuestra mano para sustituir a ibarretxe
9152887 pero eso depende de que el pse quiera y todo lo que les oigo es que prefieren al pnv
9152888 de lo contrario puede ocurrir que l pez se entregue otra vez al pnv
9152889 no descarto esa f rmula pero creo que lo mejor ser a que el lehendakari fuera del pp ahora

9152897 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
9152898 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
9152899 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table

9152903 places like redzikowo or slupsk perhaps will arouse more interest in the event of a conflict

9152908 we are sure that ulfas 27th and 709 battalions would soon agree to a ceasefire with contacts established with their leaders
9152909 the ulfa is a demoralised lot as they were facing heavy reverses following sustained anti insurgency operations by security forces the cadres were also getting disillusioned with the rebel leadership losing focus and control of the situation
9152910 people of assam want peace and the ulfa central leadership should respect the aspirations of the people and come for unconditional peace talks
9152911 we told buragohain about the general mood of the people of assam and urged him to convey the same to the ulfa central leadership for joining the peace process we met him at the tezpur jail
9152912 the curfew will be relaxed for two hours in the district headquarters of badgam ganderbal shopian kulgam kupwara and pulwama from 11 a m to 1 p m

9152914 the minorities should not be treated as cannon fodder to carry out the agenda of vested interests in sabotaging the peoples movement of kashmir
9152915 this new finding may help to explain why the clock is so far reaching in its effects on the organism
9152916 it appears the clock influences a number of biological processes including cell cycling protein metabolism and varied signalling processes
9152917 the resulting molecular mechanism or genetic network for the clock identified by this mode guided discovery process will have a broad appeal to geneticists physiologists and those with an interest in signalling pathways the methods used to characterize what makes a biological clock tick will have numerous applications in finding genetic networks describing other complex traits in many biological systems

9152922 i think his plan is made he wants an election period
9152923 he said he felt his knee and that he was not fit enough to play
9152924 there is nothing you can to do about it if a player declares himself unfit you have to accept that
9152925 wed have liked to play him and get him back into the run of things and playing football again
9152926 to be honest he has not played enough football in the last year hed like to get back and it is disappointing
9152927 i cannot deny that zenit deserved to win the game i think that they probably just shaded is a little from us
9152928 the one thing that kept them going was that they had three occasions when they got to the byline in the first 20 minutes and that was a concern for me
9152929 i was obviously looking forward to half time to eradicate that which we did in the second half
9152930 i think in tight games whoever scores the first goal is in a good position and conceding the first goal right on half time was a bad goal for us
9152931 there was not much in it and we congratulate st petersburg on the victory
9152932 the sending off was unfortunate it was an instinctive thing
9152933 he will be a good addition for us he has experience of playing in the premier league for manchester city he has qualities we need
9152934 we need to improve in wide areas and we are trying to find a solution
9152935 riera is a left winger has experience in the premier league so i would expect him to settle down quickly
9152936 wingers are difficult to find so we have searched and we believe we will sign one soon we also have fabio aurelio and andreas dossena who can also work out wide

9152941 according to what we know now evidence has been obtained at the scene suggesting that the shots fired at the vehicle came from german guns
9152942 whether shots were fired from the other side towards the vehicle has yet to be conclusively established
9152943 there are no grounds at the present time to accuse any of the german soldiers of wrongdoing

9152963 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
9152964 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
9152965 im krankenhaus habe ich wieder den k mpfer mit gesehen der am liebsten aus dem bett springen m chte und zur ck aufs fu ballfeld will
9152966 er hat mich sofort nach dem spielverlauf gefragt und war mehr bei seinem fc als bei seinem gesundheitszustand
9152967 this is the process and i am going to follow it
9152968 its ridiculous its an outrage and a huge huge inconvenience to these people to make them come back to court next week they are here now we all are here now
9152969 in de zomer zijn er veel buitenlanders bijgekomen dat is heel on westerlo en heeft dus wat tijd nodig

9152974 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
9152975 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
9152976 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
9152977 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
9152978 bpm is a management practice that provides for governance of a businesss process environment toward the goal of improving agility and operational performance bpm is a structured approach employing methods policies metrics management practices and software tools to manage and continuously optimize an organizations activities and processes
9152979 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
9152980 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
9152981 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9152982 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9152983 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9152984 the decision ive got to make will be made on the basis of whos best to play against kilmarnock
9152985 what happened on tuesday with the two lads coming in and getting goals has given me even more to think about
9152986 weve got great options so the players who do play know that theres people waiting there ready to step in
9152987 every single game has been hard and playing at tannadice is going to be a tough game
9152988 but we are in good form and hopefully we can get another victory
9152989 winning is good for your confidence a real lift its too soon to say how things will go
9152990 this is only the fourth game of the season and there is still a long way to go we need to just keep playing well and keep our confidence up
9152991 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9152992 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9152993 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
9152994 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
9152995 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
9152996 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
9152997 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
9152998 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
9152999 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
9153000 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
9153001 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9153002 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
9153003 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
9153004 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
9153005 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
9153006 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
9153007 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
9153008 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
9153009 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
9153010 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
9153011 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
9153012 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9153013 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
9153014 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
9153015 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
9153016 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
9153017 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
9153018 i should perhaps also have to explain why other players were not playing
9153019 you make a decision and that was that dominguez played the first half and arshavin the second its as simple as that
9153020 they tottenham had several weeks of time to buy him and they did not offer 22million like everybody has been writing but just 16million
9153021 its no secret that weve been in the market for a defensive midfield player over the summer and im pleased to welcome dickson to fulham
9153022 dickson fits the profile we were seeking his athleticism strength and brand of football will offer a new dimension to players we have available in midfield
9153023 the transfer window closes in a few days time and im delighted with the signings we have made this summer
9153024 im thinking more about the ryder cup than this to be honest with you
9153025 im trying to get my game ready for that being my first ryder cup i want to play well and represent our country to the best of my ability
9153026 if we win that would be great if not at least i go there and had a great time knowing that i gave it my all thats all you can do
9153027 my game is in pretty good form so if i try to focus on being 100 percent for the ryder cup it doesnt mean that im going to play bad these next few weeks
9153028 it just means that maybe my focus is more down the road
9153029 im playing well and my goal this week was just to make the cut because ive had great success here in the past
9153030 he said he felt his knee and that he was not fit enough to play
9153031 there is nothing you can to do about it if a player declares himself unfit you have to accept that
9153032 wed have liked to play him and get him back into the run of things and playing football again
9153033 hes had no pre season games and i have no estimate as to when he may play
9153034 as far as i know hes in pretty good nick he had just picked up a calf strain in training
9153035 thats not far away from being ok yes hes had problems and if he had been playing every game we wouldnt have got him for next to nothing
9153036 there will be some money after hes played games but there is no initial outlay he has to play before we play
9153037 if i can get him out 20 times a season that gives us a chance of winning 20 games
9153038 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
9153039 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
9153040 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
9153041 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
9153042 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
9153043 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9153044 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9153045 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9153046 but is it a problem that she has so many kids and one is young and has downs syndrome
9153047 but is it a problem that she has so many kids and one is young and has downs syndrome
9153048 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
9153049 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
9153050 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
9153051 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
9153052 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
9153053 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
9153054 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
9153055 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
9153056 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
9153057 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
9153058 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
9153059 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
9153060 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
9153061 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
9153062 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9153063 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9153064 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
9153065 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
9153066 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
9153067 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

9153291 in fact i woke up this morning in virginia and tonight were doing a show in lake wales florida
9153292 six months later i convinced bill this was a good way to make a living
9153293 i guess it has because its taken us to every state in the union and to 40 countries

9153296 but what id like to have happen is someday someone will say to another group oh you guys are like team rootberry

9153482 the answer may be in software software is an intellectual product but is more than a book or a piece of music because it controls physical machines which in turn have the potential to produce or aid the production of physical products im sure youre familiar with the olpc project on their wiki site they have a section for proposed software of the xo laptop some time ago in that section i proposed a modular building design tool based on as you might have guessed box beam this program would be a very simplified 3d cad program specific to the geometric system of box beam and with simplified finite element analysis so that it would tell you when a structure design was out of the bounds of safety box beam only deals in a few basic kinds of standardized elements so one could easily design objects like playing with a virtual building toy and then the program could print out the standard isometric planar and exploded views and a recipe list for the parts with this program kids and their teachers could design things that they could actually make themselves with very simple tools which would be perfectly functional and using the internet they could trade these designs with other kids around the world and create a communal archive for them all all the furniture in a classroom could be made by the students themselves and then they could take that skill set home and make useful things their on their own and with their parents box beam is a good choice for this because its based on simple materials wood and any flat stock that are pretty cheap dont need heavy industry to produce and are likely to be obtainable even in the developing world now imagine if you could do something like this for a very large variety of artifacts and technologies this is what i was planning for the open source everything project the idea here isnt just to invent and disseminate a collection of open source artifact designs the idea is to create an organized mass exchange of these designs bootstrapped by starting it out with the dissemination of designs for tools and the techniques for them its not just about products its an open source industrial infrastructure designs for everyday objects that improve standard of living are good but to begin with you have to disseminate the tools and techniques to make those with too ultimately people have to learn how to make things wherever they are with whatever resources are at hand its not always going to be in the same ways you can run a program that donates masses of power tools or puts fab labs in the congo but thats only helpful until they break so what you have to do is develop and communicate this whole open source ecology of progressive industrial capability as if nasa had to communicate to a bunch of colonists on mars how to bootstrap a civilization from scratch starting with a small kit of hand tools now the key thing here is that the end result is physical goods and any physical artifact you can make you can potentially sell as youve already learned softwares economic value is keyed to the exclusivity of its distribution it has no value in and of itself if i open a business based on putting linux in a box on store shelves i can only make money from the most hapless computer novices people so ignorant they probably couldnt use something as complex as linux anyway so monetization of linux has been based on two things appropriating code for reuse in propriety software one can control distribution of or turning the linux community into a trades guild for specialist technicians versed in its unique language which is probably why linux development has made such slow effort towards being easier to use theres monetary value in the community specific exclusivity of its based of knowledge which is why early scientists physicians and trades guilds had a habit of documenting all their knowledge in secret codes but its a different story when the end result of open source development is physical products even if the knowledge of how to make a thing is completely free and universally available the tools skill talent materials and time to make it arent so theres value encoded in the production of an artifact not everyone can or will make something themselves so this presents an opportunity for entrepreneurship within a local market theres a common phenomenon in the world of crafts and hobbies someone can publicly share the complete knowledge for how to make something on line or in magazine articles and they will still get letters from people asking them to make the thing for them for a price or sell them materials they cant find locally maker skills and the tools and free time to use them are not universal especially in the western world we dont have a culture like indonesias so from this often come the start of new small businesses people start making things on commission for others or start selling in small volumes hard to find parts and materials that they have found a source for in bulk or they develop and sell kits where the rare materials are pre packaged and the hardest parts of making an item have been pre done if you have some business savvy which is also in short supply in the west you can cultivate this into a self perpetuating industry and a life long career countless businesses have been created in this way now open source artifacts will generally not compete with corporate industrial products in the western world for some time they will tend to be clunky will cost more that what you can get at wal mart and their appeal will most likely be based on their counter cultural aspect their novelty and their potential for customization people in the west dont use linux because its better than windows or mac os frankly all computer operating systems suck rocks with equal vigor and should have been obsolesced 20 years ago they use it because its an alternative to those but in other countries where hard cash is hard to come by linux is the only legitimate game in town so it becomes a means of empowerment albeit a bit weak because the hardware still can be produced locally the same will be true of open source artifacts look at how big a deal the baygen freeplay energy companys radios are radios that are totally non competitive on the western electronics market yet theyre doing wonders for people in developing countries or disaster situations and which western people are perfectly happy to pay a premium for here knowing it helps support local industry and aid projects in the developing world thats a powerful thing to tap into can you imagine the impact of a freeplay refrigerator so i see this post industrial revolution evolving like this initiated in the west the maker movement will remain focused on hobby and altruistic activity for the near term future periodically producing altruistic projects based on models like olpc and freeplay to disseminate the more practical and appropriate of post industrial technology in the developing world and the new developing world in the inner cities it will pursue functional parity with industrial age technology but not cost parity which it really cant do until long term trends push the costs of labor and resources beyond a certain threshold and will favor pushing the leading edge in the technology so the counter cultural symbolism novelty and customization potential of these open source fabrication technologies and their products will be what sustains the movement for some time there will be some entrepreneurship generated after the models of hobby craft community entrepreneurship and some attempts by corporations to exploit the novelty or unique technologies that might emerge in the manner of the linux monetization strategy but in general this may remain marginal for a long time it will be a while before makers can match the ipod or a bmw in the developing world the maker movement already nascent but amplified by western outquisition activity like olpc will bring new empowerment manifesting as new entrepreneurship which will interface with the microloan movement to create new post industrial infrastructures that are very practical and functional in a spare resource situation both functional and cost parity with western products will be pursued because labor is so much cheaper in this environment and hard currency so much more dear some of this entrepreneurship will branch off into parallels of existing globalization industrial models job shops for export goods but much will remain local dissemination of post industrial technology brings with it ad hoc technological education leading to the potential for innovation in the context of adapting open source designs for greater local appropriateness this will feed back through the communications networks for maker knowledge distribution to the west expanding the base of novelty but also providing very practical answers that would tend to elude western makers because of their different environment and less practical thinking technology tends to both disseminate and assimilate culture where its development has an opportunity to flow in more than one direction americans introduced personal computers to japan and now americans play japanese designed computer games with asian cultural themes on them and the chinese farm gold for those players this feedback would have the potential of pushing post industrial technology to critical mass because for people in the developing world this isnt fun and games or a counter cultural movement this is their first real world practical industrial infrastructure and theyre going to use it to catch up with the western standard of living despite their lack of industrial age style resource infrastructures as those old infrastructures break down in the west the outquisition might reverse direction in predominate knowledge flow the real eco tech safe haven may be in the third world this is why i was interested in that notion of a maker incubator that was globally mobile or had mobile satellites right now there is a lot of practical technology in the rest of the world that we in the west never hear about the auram 3000 is a good example of that maybe 1 of all green builders in the us and europe have heard of it the way most chinese cities grow most of their produce within city limits is another nyc now talks about vertical farm skyscrapers to do this but the chinese have done it without such elaborate structures forever hell the us is in such a self imposed vacuum its nearly as bad as north korea we dont even know whats going on in most of the rest of the west i wonder how many readers of the make blog have ever heard of n55 in denmark http www n55 dk they were active makers before the term came into fashion so such mobility is intended for two way communication and education for too long western people have acted like the developing world is populated by feral children but these people know stuff useful stuff theyve got just as much to teach as to learn you dont survive on the narrow resource margins they do being stupid i suspect that in this fact is the potential for that post industrial critical mass

9153550 i enjoyed every minute at newcastle it was a fantastic club i enjoyed working with the manager and they are a great bunch of lads
9153551 but i knew offers had come in over the summer and the club had turned them down and the valuation of me wasnt reflected in the deal i was on
9153552 speaking to them i felt it was the right thing to put in a transfer request to show how i felt seeing as they didnt think they were on the same wavelength as me and they then made the decision to sell me
9153553 it was newcastles decision and now i am at aston villa a new contract was never discussed that was a source of frustration
9153554 i nearly signed two years ago that was a tough time for me and villa as well it obviously threw their plans into turmoil that was a tough time
9153555 you learn from that and you move on and two years later i am sure i am a stronger character and a better player for those experiences
9153556 the fee had been agreed i came down here to the training ground and got into the managers office and he said he had a phone call to say newcastle had changed their mind
9153557 at first i didnt know if it was the managers humour and whether he was joking with me but it wasnt a joke that is in the past and it is how you react to those sort of things
9153558 the best way i know is to get my head down and work hard i went back to newcastle and did as well as i could
9153559 he has been fantastic with me all the way through i had a great relationship with him learnt a lot and wish him every luck
9153560 we talked a few times and last night once the fee had been agreed he wished me every luck in the world and that is it basically
9153561 things change quickly in football all i know is the offer has been accepted and im a villa player now and the newcastle chapter is ended
9153562 im pleased that there are a lot of players in that squad that i took there a long time ago
9153563 im delighted that they got themselves promoted last year they have fantastic support and the football club needs to be in the premier league and its nice to see them back
9153564 from my own time i went there with no expectation at all we were down the bottom of the league we had no money we were skint we were losing 30 000 a week we turned all that around and managed to get promoted
9153565 but with tonys job there is now expectation there west brom now is entirely different to when i was there because it has been in the premier league a couple of times it now has got a training ground and it probably isnt losing 30 000 a week
9153566 it seems a little bit more settled than when i was there and they have now got to take the next step and establish themselves in the premier league and stop doing the yo yo stuff and im sure they will do
9153567 the support and the fan base are brilliant we managed to get it going there a bit and everyone played their part most of all the supporters because some of the football we played at times was just geared to making sure we got results it wasnt particularly pleasing on the eye at times
9153568 they got behind that and were a big part of it and consequently they are where they are now they play differently now because they can do because they have got a different kind of player
9153569 it doesnt matter what sort of reaction i get from the west brom supporters my impression of them will never change

9153587 jon corzine at this convention seemed to do exactly that he is the leader of his party running for re election and anybody whos thinking of challenging him has to consider that
9153588 clearly hes a national figure based on relationships hes built over the years
9153589 people all over the country in this party identify him as a great governor because of his efforts to restore fiscal responsibility to new jersey i hope the people of new jersey see it that way
9153590 people told me all day that new jersey did the right thing in giving over our hillary clinton delegates to barack obama

9153598 i wrecked my car and i want your company to pay to get it fixed and heres one months premium i want to take the car into the shop as soon as i leave here and by the way as soon as my car gets fixed ill be canceling the policy because dont like that pesky monthly premium

9153601 reforming admissions policies would be a good place to start in stopping discrimination
9153602 there are faith schools that are 90 per cent or even 100 per cent funded by the tax payer and yet they only cater or prioritise five per cent of the population often faith schools take pupils only from their own faith or even from their own denomination within a faith
9153603 90 per cent of the population have been ruled out straight away
9153604 if they can actually recruit from 100 per cent rather than 10 per cent of those available they will get a better calibre of teacher
9153605 we need schools which embrace the diversity in our communities not schools which divide pupils and staff by faith all children regardless of their religion culture and family income should have equal access to the best possible education in a good local school
9153606 allowing schools to pick and choose pupils is not the best way to achieve this or to create young adults with the confidence and personal skills to live and work in our vibrant multi cultural society
9153607 as a rabbi i am committed to jewish values and to passing them on to my children but as a rabbi i also understand that no one gains if this is done in such a way that it damages good community relations as in separate religious schools
9153608 faith schools are a long established part of the state school system in england
9153609 parents should be able to choose the type of education and ethos they want for their children
9153610 the bottom line is that faith schools are successful thriving popular and here to stay it is down to locally accountable councils and communities themselves not some campaign group to decide what sort of schools they want

9153656 i am not at liberty to outline any of our positions until i get the green light from my authorities
9153657 it zanu pf said from its perspective all that remained was for the mdc to append its signature to the document or withhold it for as long as it likes knowing fully well that the process of forming a government would proceed unhindered

9153677 reforming admissions policies would be a good place to start in stopping discrimination
9153678 there are faith schools that are 90 per cent or even 100 per cent funded by the tax payer and yet they only cater or prioritise five per cent of the population often faith schools take pupils only from their own faith or even from their own denomination within a faith
9153679 90 per cent of the population have been ruled out straight away
9153680 if they can actually recruit from 100 per cent rather than 10 per cent of those available they will get a better calibre of teacher
9153681 we need schools which embrace the diversity in our communities not schools which divide pupils and staff by faith all children regardless of their religion culture and family income should have equal access to the best possible education in a good local school
9153682 allowing schools to pick and choose pupils is not the best way to achieve this or to create young adults with the confidence and personal skills to live and work in our vibrant multi cultural society
9153683 as a rabbi i am committed to jewish values and to passing them on to my children but as a rabbi i also understand that no one gains if this is done in such a way that it damages good community relations as in separate religious schools
9153684 faith schools are a long established part of the state school system in england
9153685 parents should be able to choose the type of education and ethos they want for their children

9153705 we get from time to time people saying youre biased in favour of the labour party every time i ask people show me a case of that bias explain to me where we got it wrong and why what we said was so unfair they seem to be unable to do so
9153706 the bbc is not impartial or neutral its a publicly funded urban organisation with an abnormally large number of young people ethnic minorities and gay people it has a liberal bias not so much a party political bias it is better expressed as a cultural liberal bias
9153707 its not a conspiracy its visceral they think they are on the middle ground
9153708 the idea of a tax on the ownership of a television belongs in the 1950s why not tax people for owning a washing machine to fund the manufacture of persil
9153709 people who know a lot more than i do may be right when they claim that global warming is the consequence of our own behaviour i assume that this is why the bbcs coverage of the issue abandoned the pretence of impartiality long ago

9153720 un coche invisible que salio de la nada me dio un golpe y desaparecio

9153755 no fue porque exista una conspiraci n del silencio lo que hay es una autorrepresi n psicol gica en la sociedad chilena frente al conflicto con el pueblo mapuche creemos que si no lo vemos desaparece

9153757 sacar el conflicto mapuche del mbito policial y reconocerle su condici n de problema pol tico
9153758 la clave del problema es que nos hemos negado a reconocerles su condici n de pueblo aceptaremos ahora que en el estado de chile puede coexistir m s de un pueblo

9153768 no les parec a que los delitos calificaran de terrorismo pero el gobierno insisti ante la corte suprema contratando los servicios de un prominente abogado amigo y profesor de los jueces que deb an resolver
9153769 y el tema desapareci de la agenda de gobierno esta administraci n nunca tuvo realmente una pol tica para enfrentar el conflicto mapuche
9153770 estamos dispuestos a aceptar al mapuche folcl rico aquel que baila con sus trajes t picos y es amable pero no al joven que se viste con chaqueta de cuero y que se nos para de igual a igual exigiendo respeto a sus derechos
9153771 pero se equivocaron quienes creyeron que este asistencialismo iba a desindigenizar a los j venes mapuches al contrario el acceso al conocimiento y a los derechos que hoy se les reconocen internacionalmente a los pueblos ind genas han alentado sus demandas
9153772 el gobierno se enfrenta hoy a una intifada mapuche y ya se dio cuenta de que el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas pero es dif cil saber hasta d nde se va a llegar el problema de fondo sigue siendo el reconocimiento pol tico la existencia de un pueblo y el derecho a la tierra porque como ha demostrado el conflicto palestino israel no hay cultura sin territorio

9153779 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas

9153789 exigimos respeto por los derechos de los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos mapuche considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad donde los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos son objetos de actos de violencia institucional los hechos de violencia institucional se repiti en el allanamiento del d a domingo 24 de agosto en donde resultaron varios ni os mujeres y ancianos con asfixias y lesiones esta situaci n sucede porque carabinero act a bajo la doctrina del enemigo mapuche
9153790 a ra z del descontrol y los ataques indiscriminados de carabineros en contra de los mapuche result herido con balines el sargento edgardo alvarado esta elocuente situaci n pone de relieve y desmiente la participaci n de los mapuche en actos de violencia
9153791 denunciamos la agitaci n para el uso de la violencia institucional de parte del senador alberto espina unidos al gremio de agricultores agrupados en la sofo y muchos de ellos actores de la usurpaci n de tierras mapuche asimismo el gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n quienes han venido haciendo apolog a publica sobre la violencia amenazas reiteradas para el uso de las arma de fuego en contra de los mapuche
9153792 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos vinculados a los agricultores a las empresas forestales y el propio estado chileno
9153793 en vista que el estado chileno no ha protegido nuestros derechos el aumento del racismo odioso de los agricultores de las empresas forestales de los camioneros y la agitaci n de algunos parlamentarios en esta oportunidad concurriremos a la jurisdicci n internacional y a los mecanismos de protecci n a los derechos humanos para solicitar medidas cautelares a favor de las comunidades y la protecci n de los ni os mujeres y ancianos mapuche
9153794 el pueblo mapuche tiene la amplia disposici n para el di logo en la medida que el derecho a la autodeterminaci n el autogobierno mapuche y el territorio sean los ejes fundamentales del di logo

9153801 el agua dada la trascendencia que tiene para la vida humana el agua realmente est dentro de la categor a de los derechos humanos
9153802 comprobamos c mo los recursos naturales son extra dos y contaminados por el ego smo de algunos de intereses de grupos de poder amparados por el actual modelo econ mico en perjuicio de los pobres los campesinos y los ind genas un cuidado especial merece el recurso del agua que empieza a ser escaso convirti ndose en el mediano plazo en fuente de conflictos en el mundo
9153803 ticamente es para nosotros inaceptable sea el proyecto en s mismo que planea construir cinco mega centrales en ays n y consideramos inaceptable la postura del estado frente a estas situaciones que se han ido dando con incluso apoyos p blicos de algunos ministros previo a la presentaci n del proyecto de impacto ambiental
9153804 se plantea un cuestionamiento sereno ya que desde la tica y la espiritualidad surgen una serie de elementos que llevados a la pr ctica nos platean en qu sociedad estamos viviendo como por ejemplo qu modelo econ mico nos rige y qu efecto tiene en las actitudes y vida de cada uno de nosotros y tambi n plantea una pol tica de estado sobre la relaci n social y el ambiente en que vivimos
9153805 frente a la amenaza ecol gica que estamos viviendo hoy d a un modelo neoliberal tan extremo y tan desencarnado como el que se est llevando adelante en chile creemos que es altamente perjudicial por la destrucci n de la naturaleza y sus recursos especialmente del agua dejada en manos de empresa particulares que ciertamente lo que buscan es el bien propio y no tanto el bien com n
9153806 hay que cambiar la forma de interdependencia entre los seres humanos y dar pie a relaciones nuevas donde la econom a se preocupe del ser humano

9153808 all en per hay un mejor clima laboral y un mejor control contra la violencia le est haciendo muy mal a chile esta idea de que a trav s de la violencia y de la ilegalidad los grupos de presi n pueden satisfacer sus demandas
9153809 ya quisiera alg n partido u ong tener tanta influencia
9153810 los pueblos ind genas no se oponen al desarrollo sino que quieren ser incluidos en sus propios t rminos y esto no comprende el gobierno
9153811 que es mucho m s peligroso que los decretos 1015 y 1073 e hizo un llamado a las comunidades del pa s para continuar la lucha por la derogatoria de estos otros decretos
9153812 asombra la facilidad con que se estigmatiza a todo el pueblo mapuche
9153813 me asombra la facilidad con la cual a partir de estos hechos se estigmatiza al pueblo mapuche como un todo cuando quienes vivimos en la regi n de la araucan a y conocemos al campesino de esta etnia sabemos que se trata de personas emprendedoras cuya principal preocupaci n radica en sacar adelante a sus familias y en poder trabajar para conseguirlo tal como cualquier chileno
9153814 conozco al pueblo mapuche he visto como se desconocen sus derechos ancestrales he compartido con l desde mi primera infancia he alojado en sus comunidades y s que son los chilenos a los cuales la sociedad otorga menos oportunidades y de los cuales m s se abusa esto llega al punto de que cuando el estado les asigna recursos como ocurre con el programa or genes hay una corte de intermediarios y consultoras de partidos pol ticos que tienen como conducta permanente aprovechar en propio beneficio los dineros que se destinan al pueblo mapuche
9153815 mientras hay subsidio para plantar rboles en los campos de la araucan a y as desplazar a las ciudades al mapuche no hay subsidio para que estos campesinos puedan siquiera mantener una agricultura de subsistencia ello es inducido por las pol ticas de gobierno para expulsar al mapuche de sus tierras y fr amente desruralizar la araucan a
9153816 la injusta estigmatizaci n que cierta prensa hace del pueblo mapuche el aprovechamiento de ciertos pol ticos de los recursos que la ley destina al pueblo mapuche y la desruralizaci n impulsada desde el estado forman parte del clima contrario a la generaci n de paz social que nuestra araucan a necesita para dejar de ser la m s pobre del pa s y ser la regi n perdedora de la cual hablan los organismos internacionales
9153817 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
9153818 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
9153819 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas
9153820 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
9153821 la escuela en un alto grado es una fuente de cultivo para el racismo la discriminaci n la negaci n de todo lo mapuche
9153822 los derechos educativos y ling sticos son parte importante de los derechos colectivos de nuestro pueblo naci n mapuche reconocidos por la legislaci n internacional en varios instrumentos convenio 169 oit convenci n de los derechos del ni o declaraci n de diversidad cultural unesco declaraci n de la onu derechos pueblos ind genas y que en el proyecto lge del gobierno no son expresados reflejando una vez mas la sistem tica pol tica de violaci n a nuestros derechos pol ticos como pueblo naci n mapuche por parte de la institucionalidad racista del estado chileno
9153823 disminuye la cantidad de hablantes y se interrumpe el aprendizaje por las nuevas ge ne ra ciones
9153824 los pueblos originarios no fueron incluidos en la discusi n de la lge
9153825 cuando las demandas no son satisfechas y se van acumulando se pueden generar condiciones para manifestaciones m s duras que en algunos casos llegan a alterar el orden p blico
9153826 si enfrentamos preventivamente las dificultades y las demandas que tienen las comunidades no s lo en temas de tierras sino que en temas de vivienda de agua de asistencia productiva vamos a estar disminuyendo tensiones

9153834 considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad

9154073 some t cell receptors are adept at promoting autoimmunity some are poor and some are protective it is not clear why one t cell receptor can promote autoimmunity whereas another t cell receptor on a similar kind of t cell either doesnt do anything or even protects against autoimmune reaction
9154074 this finding of an association between t cell engraftment and spontaneous disease suggested to us that there is some barrier to the development of disease
9154075 why are cells that engraft better more likely to cause disease we really dont know the answer once the mice start to get disease they get very sick but there is sort of a triggering point our findings may suggest that disease triggering in these models involves a mass effect that requires some quantity of specific t cells to ignite disease but we really want to find out whether it is the cell number itself or whether receptor recognition properties that lead to increased engraftment also lead to increased susceptibility to disease these are things we can test
9154076 these findings dont have a direct clinical implication right now but if we understand which t cells induce pathology and why and which cells are protective or passive we will gain a better sense of where to target what are called antigen specific therapies
9154077 those therapies try to selectively target the t cells that cause disease sparing the rest of the immune system
9154078 this finding represents a key extension of other studies on puma because such loss had never been shown before in human cancer
9154079 on the one hand patients receiving traditional chemotherapy can suffer the loss of immune cells and this loss occurs in part because puma induces the death of these cells
9154080 in this case the goal would be to protect patients bone marrow by developing drugs to inhibit puma on the other hand for patients with a lymphoma in which puma was inactivated drugs could be used to reactivate the gene to trigger apoptosis and kill the tumor cells
9154081 these findings are important because while genes that cause hpe have been identified the interactions among those that produce hpe are not only complex but poorly understood
9154082 this represents a first step in understanding the mechanism of that interaction
9154083 this is good evidence for what has been called the multi hit model of hpe
9154084 in this model it takes mutations in both six3 and other genes in the sonic hedgehog pathway to produce the severe pathology of hpe
9154085 sonic hedgehog is a major player in embryonic development in the brain as well as elsewhere in the body
9154086 so this new understanding of its regulation in this very limited time and place in the brain helps us understand at a molecular level some of its overall role in brain formation
9154087 even though pneumococcus is very common until recently no one had realized that it could develop this pilus to reach out and touch a human cell
9154088 oral streptococci which are normally in the mouth and throat have the pilus genetic package and we believe pneumococcus picked it up in the back of the throat we decided to look at how the bacterium figures out how to use that package
9154089 when bacteria attack the lung there are two steps they need to do to establish pneumonia
9154090 they need to stick to lung cells and they also need to invade the lung cells our experiments were designed to separately test those two steps and we established that the pili are not used for adhesion but for invasion which was not understood before
9154091 so far only 20 percent or so of the clinically important strains of pneumococci have developed this trick of producing the proteins for making pili
9154092 in creating vaccines we want to use proteins that occur in a wide variety of bacterial strains these pili related proteins are not prime candidates so we can now concentrate on other proteins that we know are expressed almost universally by pneumococci and that we can put into a vaccine
9154093 current vaccines used in the developed world cost over 100 a dose and are limited to protecting against perhaps 10 to 15 types of pneumococci
9154094 but that price is far too high for developing countries and there are 90 types of pneumococci out there
9154095 these findings are important because while genes that cause hpe have been identified the interactions among those that produce hpe are not only complex but poorly understood
9154096 this represents a first step in understanding the mechanism of that interaction
9154097 this is good evidence for what has been called the multi hit model of hpe
9154098 in this model it takes mutations in both six3 and other genes in the sonic hedgehog pathway to produce the severe pathology of hpe
9154099 sonic hedgehog is a major player in embryonic development in the brain as well as elsewhere in the body
9154100 so this new understanding of its regulation in this very limited time and place in the brain helps us understand at a molecular level some of its overall role in brain formation

9154109 it is always gratifying to see one of the nci designated cancer centers achieve comprehensive status recognition of excellence not only in state of the art care and cancer research but also in patient education community outreach and the dissemination of vital information to professionals and the public
9154110 these extra efforts to establish programs that reach out to surrounding communities and patients are the hallmarks of our comprehensive centers which now number 41 this enhanced designation is a timely recognition of important contributions and advances made by the dedicated staff of st jude
9154111 being designated a comprehensive cancer center is a prestigious accomplishment and to be the only pediatric center is an incomparable distinction for st jude
9154112 st jude is well known for having innovative programs led by the best and the brightest faculty and staff now being awarded comprehensive stature places an additional nci imprimatur on st jude and further validates our position among the countrys leading cancer centers this also speaks volumes about dr kastans strong leadership as our cancer center director
9154113 its rewarding to see a designation of comprehensive to an institution that is exclusively focused on children
9154114 they have a huge population of survivors that they alone have the resources and capability to bring back for follow up studies so they are to be congratulated and envied in that they are the only uniquely pediatric cancer center in the country
9154115 our international outreach program directed by dr raul ribeiro is a wonderful example of how a medical institution can provide important services to local national and worldwide communities
9154116 in addition to the effective web based efforts st jude has a long and successful track record of bringing modern medicine to less advantaged countries through education of local health care providers and establishment of pediatric cancer clinics
9154117 while maintaining significant activities in education and community service st jude will continue its major efforts in both basic laboratory research and clinical investigation to better understand the biology of cancer and develop novel treatment approaches

9154193 whats lacking in the coverage of the afghans is the sense of the humanity of the afghans
9154194 in the prince harry coverage for example there were all these people out there you never really saw them
9154195 you knew that the bombs were dropping in that direction and the guns pointing in that direction but you never got a sense of how afghans are as a people
9154196 it may sound odd but the humanity of the taliban because the taliban are a wide very diverse group of people
9154197 some of them would like to talk to the british government some of them dont want to be fighting british troops some of them would this is the ideological taliban
9154198 we never have the ability or sometimes the desire to present this in a different way so that people would be interested its a regret
9154199 in a country which is as complex and as difficult and dangerous as afghanistan you cant really cover it properly and get the full picture unless you are there day in day out unless you are living there and feeling and eating the heat and the dust
9154200 what does it feel like to be a british soldier under fire its bloody frightening and difficult and dangerous exhilarating as well
9154201 but we also want to know what it feels like to be an afghan involved with such hopes in 2001 that things would get better and theyve got a lot worse
9154202 its a hard one because with an issue like prince harry it meant that there was a series of decisions taken all along the way
9154203 if harry went there was no doubt that he was going to put himself and the lives of his commanders at risk
9154204 we are making these deals all the time when gordon brown goes to afghanistan we are not allowed to report perhaps it the deal wont happen again
9154205 it probably did bring a lot of people to think about afghanistan who normally wouldnt ordinarily think about afghanistan if the prince harry story can bring more people to think about afghanistan then thats a good thing
9154206 there was a lost opportunity there was hardly any mention of afghans even of afghanistan just a sense of i went to a country far away
9154207 viewing figures went up prince harry got a heros welcome and recruitment for the british army went up so an objective was achieved
9154208 journalists focused on the human story but it should part of a wider picture

9154223 this generation has made a god of its own the effeminate deity of the modern school is no more the true god than dagon or baal i know him not neither do i reverence him but jehovah is the true god he is the god of love but he is also robed in justice he is the god of forgiveness but he is also the god of atonement he is the god of heaven but he is also the god who sends the wicked down to hell previous about this blog lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to listen than the fat of rams and presumption is as iniquity and idolatry because you have rejected the word of the lord he has also rejected you
9154224 if you believe what you like in the gospels and reject what you dont like it is not the gospel you believe but yourself

9154273 obama says iran is a tiny country and doesnt pose a serious threat
9154274 iran radical islamic government known sponsors of terrorism developing nuclear capabilities to generate power but threatening to eliminate israel obama says iran is a tiny country doesnt pose a serious threat terrorism destroying israel those arent serious threats obama dangerously unprepared to be president
9154275 iran cuba venezuela these countries are tiny compared to the soviet union
9154276 they dont pose a serious threat to us the way the soviet union posed a threat to us
9154277 now that has to be the kind of approach that we take you know iran they spend one one hundredth of what we spend on the military if iran ever tried to pose a serious threat to us they wouldnt stand a chance and we should use that position of strength that we have to be bold enough to go ahead and listen

9154283 we took four of our mps who were critically ill in special ambulance to the parliament they came and voted from the lobby but chandrabhan disappeared at the last moment
9154284 all his allegations are false no one was sent to his house by advani or rajnath singh no one was even chanting slogans his fear of losing his constituency and membership of parliament is forcing him to level such baseless allegations we are demanding the cancellation of his membership in parliament he has betrayed the party
9154285 it was temptation to make changes but i studied the game and i felt we werent too bad

9154357 if you have players like sachin and sehwag it really helps in doing and achieving these things consistently but it their absence is not really in control because at times you willhave injuries
9154358 we didnt have ishant sharma we didnt have sachin and veeru sehwag who was in prime form but it is upto other individuals to take up the responsibility because there is no point in sitting and sulking about guys who are not there

9154403 sembra una convocazione diversa da quella che servirebbe non a palazzo chigi sul piano industriale ma al ministero del lavoro e non un problema formale tale incontro infatti non pu che prendere in esame la strumentazione degli ammortizzatori sociali a disposizione la nostra posizione nota non abbiamo alcuna intenzione di accettare un confronto esclusivamente circoscritto alla gestione degli esuberi il sindacato non accetter di essere relegato alla esclusiva gestione degli effetti sul lavoro di un piano sconosciuto

9154406 il governo ha evitato qualsiasi confronto ad ogni livello sindacale fino ad oggi e dalle dichiarazioni di esponenti di governo c da essere molto preoccupati se le indiscrezioni venissero confermate continuano le nove sigle ne risulterebbe una azienda fortemente ridimensionata troppo leggera e troppo circoscritta alle attivit di medio raggio per poter prefigurare una ragionevole prospettiva di rilancio
9154407 ragionevolezza e senso di responsabilit da parte del governo il problema va affrontato e non possibile farlo dalla coda gli effetti sul lavoro
9154408 ricorda alle nove organizzazioni sindacali maggiormente rappresentative in alitalia che loggetto dellincontro di luned come indicato nel comunicato di convocazione riguarda lesame delle ipotesi di risanamento e di nuova organizzazione nel primario interesse nazionale delle attivit attualmente gestite dalla societ alitalia e delle conseguenti iniziative per la tutela attiva dei lavoratori
9154409 parteciperanno non a caso tutti i ministri interessati agli aspetti regolatori e sostanziali del rilancio di alitalia nonch rappresentanti delladvisor incaricato di valutare le offerte relative
9154410 quindi evidente che il confronto sar a tutto campo con lobiettivo di individuare soluzioni inerenti il piano industriale e la tutela attiva dei lavoratori nei tempi brevi che sono imposti dalle condizioni oggettive della societ e del mercato in cui opera

9154508 everyone is focusing on japan as the big team in the group but i know uzbekistan from before when he was the south korea national coach they were the first team to qualify for this round so there is no reason to underestimate them
9154509 they play a russian style of football physically strong skilful with good organisation and the fans will be very fanatic
9154510 it is an interesting challenge it can help qualification if we can get a good result over there but it wont be easy
9154511 expansion of the a league is a critical issue to the continuing evolution and growth of football and this is a very exciting day for the ffa everyone involved in the a league gold coast united and north queensland

9154513 was not the no 1 paid coach in the conference
9154514 the big thing for me was how can we sit here and not be fair to him we have the no 1 coach in the conference period why wouldnt we recognize that
9154515 the thing that was important to me was that we are not just rewarding him for what he does on the field although he does that superbly
9154516 he is the consummate university citizen he is a teacher he understands the values of the institution and he connects with the faculty staff and students
9154517 thats what were rewarding him for hes the best ive ever seen at that
9154518 it is incredible the commitment that dr gee and gene smith have made to us
9154519 there is no place in the world we would rather be and we will work very hard to serve ohio state the goal that ellen and i have is to make sure these blessings make a difference to others
9154520 i honestly think jim tressel is so committed to our program that we could not raise his salary not extend his contract and hed stay and be loyal
9154521 but thats all the more reason to recognize someone you dont take advantage of someone you take advantage of what you have because of him
9154522 i dont think of him as a guy like florida state coach bobby bowden or penn state coach joe paterno
9154523 you always take every opponent seriously but that was a reminder and a wake up call for everyone about just how important that is
9154524 every team comes into ohio stadium ready to give us their best shot so we always have to be fully prepared and ready
9154525 thats a tough team they played us tough last year
9154526 i think the first time you do anything its a little bit different and especially something as emotional as playing against somewhere where you were for 15 years
9154527 its still a little bit different youre sitting there watching the film of the same field that you used to watch for 15 years before and you wonder if youre in ground hog day or whatever so its a little different but not totally different than a year ago
9154528 theyre a physical bunch and just like we told our guys going into last years game their defense is going to fill up the box and theyre going to dare you to run
9154529 and youre going to have to handle more guys being there than you can conceivably block and if youre going to beat them youre going to have to throw
9154530 we really dont know what theyre going to be doing because theres a whole bunch of different kinds of spread
9154531 bronson arroyo does that whenever someone has a great game
9154532 i looked up at the scoreboard when i was in the outfield and it was nice to see that 11
9154533 edinson didnt have his best night but it was one of those nights where we put together great at bats and helped him out a little
9154534 we were one hit away too many times we just never finished off innings offensively
9154535 even grady sizemore the last hitter because thats the way things have been going lately
9154536 it was a good day for him he swung the bat pretty well

9154539 katakanlah wahai muhammad aku tidak dapati dalam apa yang telah diwahyukan kepadaku sesuatu yang diharamkan bagi orang yang hendak memakannya melainkan kalau benda itu bangkai atau darah yang mengalir atau daging babi kerana sesungguhnya ia adalah kotor
9154540 ya rasulullah s a w jika salah seorang dari kami pakaiannya terkena darah haid apa yang perlu ia lakukan
9154541 keriklah gosok dengan air dan basuhlah cucilah kemudian pakailah ia untuk mengerjakan solat
9154542 suatu hari kami mengerjakan solat bersama nabi sallallahu alaihi wasallam
9154543 di tengah solat tadi jibril datang kepadaku dan memberitahu bahawa di kasutku terdapat najis kekotoran maka kerana itulah aku menanggalkannya jika seseorang kamu datang ke masjid hendaklah ia menterbalikkan dua kasutnya dan memerhatikannya jika ia nampak ada najis hendaklah ia menggosoknya ke tanah kemudian bolehlah ia menunaikan solat dengan memakai kasutnya itu
9154544 sesiapa menunaikan solat dengan ada najis di pakainnya kerana lupa atau tidak tahu tidak perlu ia ulangi solatnya

9154551 la preocupaci n es sobre los mecanismos de control de contenidos que pueda aplicar el ejecutivo si s lo se tiene un punto de interconexi n
9154552 qu garant a hay de que no exista un control de la sociedad y que este punto de acceso a la red no va a afectar el acceso a determinado tipo de informaciones
9154553 tiene que demostrar la necesidad de hacer esa reserva sobre los medios
9154554 el proyecto de ley del sector se someti a la habilitante y estamos llev ndolo ahora a la asamblea nacional ese es un proyecto de ley que va a ser sometido a la consulta p blica y no creo que haya razones para tener esa intranquilidad
9154555 las versiones que han circulado por all son borradores del momento no son la versi n definitiva esa la daremos a conocer a toda la poblaci n y sobre todo al sector para que emita su opini n
9154556 ten amos una ley de telecomunicaciones que llevamos a la habilitante pero consideramos prudente llevarlo a la asamblea nacional para que sea un poco de debate por la comunidad el planteamiento que hacemos es primeramente la integraci n de las funciones del ministerio

9154560 ik heb net afgesproken een film te maken over de oprichting van facebook
9154561 ik dacht dat het een goede eerste stap zou zijn om uit te vinden wat facebook is en daarom heb ik deze account aangemaakt althans hij is aangemaakt door mijn onderzoeker ian reichbach want mijn grootmoeder heeft meer kennis van internet dan ik en zij is al 33 jaar dood

9154565 ecco appunto ti stavo proprio per chiamare per invitarti a venire con noi c anche mattia
9154566 io nicole jessica e angela mattia viene con il suo amico stefano
9154567 ciao dott grazie per lo strappo ci vediamo oggi alle cinque c pure romina
9154568 e chi questa quella l con cui stavi parlando stamattina
9154569 uhm non c ho fatto caso allora io chiamo serena mi ci gioco i coglioni che ci viene solo perch ci sono io non hai visto come mi guarda l ho gi fatta impazzire
9154570 dai ti vengo a prendere io alle cinque ci stai frocio
9154571 a major challenge is that the roads are crowded it s becoming like hosur road in bangalore we need help from the government
9154572 it is a premature judgment once the work is completed the traffic will flow smoothly we also want it companies to resort to car pooling and to stop parking their buses on the road as that reduces road space
9154573 stammi a sentire ti amo pi di qualsiasi altra cosa al mondo senza eccezioni non ti basta
9154574 prima di te bella la mia vita era una notte senza luna molto buia ma con qualche stella punti di luce e razionalit poi hai attraversato il cielo come una meteora allimprovviso tutto ha preso fuoco cera luce cera bellezza quando sei sparita la meteora scomparsa dietro lorizzontee il buio tornato non era cambiato nulla ma i miei occhi erano rimasti accecati non vedevo pi le stelle niente aveva pi senso

9154578 saya bangga dengan skuad saya kami juga memiliki pemain yang bagus di bench jadi tak perlu membeli pemain lagi selama semuanya tetap tinggal
9154579 cuarenta a os despu s de su muerte el che sigue siendo un importante s mbolo por varios motivos
9154580 el che es una clara imagen del idealismo y la rebeli n juvenil ambos en mi opini n valores eternos e intemporales no estamos interesados en la situaci n pol tica actual de cuba somos cineastas que realizan una pel cula acerca de un periodo de tiempo espec fico desde el punto de vista del che
9154581 hemos hablado con mucha gente de ambos bandos y toda nuestra investigaci n se refleja en el gui n
9154582 cuando decidimos a adir las partes de cuba y nueva york y empezamos a trabajar en la estructura la pel cula empez a crecer y crecer entonces nos dimos cuenta de que ten amos que rodar dos pel culas
9154583 una de las mayores dificultades para steven y benicio en cuanto al gui n fue el hecho de que tuvieramos tanta informaci n y hubieramos escuchado historias incre bles de tanta gente
9154584 condensar este material contar la historia completa y hacer que pareciera real supuso un reto extraordinario
9154585 muchos guionistas quer an ayudar a steven a crear su versi n pero habr an tardado como m nimo un a o en ponerse al dia con el material fue entonces cuando me llam peter para recordarme que el ya hab a hecho toda la investigaci n sent una enorme gratitud hizo una labor magn fica ayudandonos a estructurar la pel cula
9154586 cuando llam a laura aproximadamente cinco a os despu s de haber realizado la investigaci n le dije que si solo buscaban un guionista para sentarse con steven en una habitaci n y hacer una lluvia de ideas estar a encantado de hacer de caja de resonancia para el
9154587 decid escribir un nico gui n con tres hilos argumentales la vida del che y la revoluci n cubana en uno su ca da en otro y entre medias el viaje a nueva york para hablar ante las naciones unidas
9154588 la desventaja de hacer una nica pel cula con todas esas historias es que cuando tienes que condensar la historia se distorsiona todos sab amos que en la selecci n del material hab a mucho en juego siempre intento ser fiel al esp ritu de la historia pero en este caso hay mucha gente en ambos bandos que aun tienen opiniones muy apasionadas acerca de este tema
9154589 steven pens que no har amos justicia a cada una de las historias importantes en un nico gui n y dijo que hab a tenido la idea de hacer dos pel culas
9154590 tuve que replantear toda la estructura del hilo argumental de cuba porque en un principio hab a escrito una versi n muy condensada tuve que volver a la historia steven benicio y laura estuvieron muy implicados en ese proceso de trabajo
9154591 no creo que hubieramos podido filmar estas dos pel culas con el presupuesto que ten amos si soderbergh no hubiera sido el director la enorme velocidad a la que ten amos que mover cada dia a los actores y el equipo supuso un gran reto
9154592 nos ocurri un afortunado incidente porque nuestros visados y papeles de trabajo para espa a no estuvieron listos a tiempo steven benicio y yo tuvimos que quedarnos en los angeles durante una semana y fue durante esa semana cuando llamaron para decir que el prototipo de c mara estaba preparado
9154593 filmar con red es como escuchar a los beatles por primera vez
9154594 red ve las cosas como yo las veo alg n d a espero descubrir como consiguen exactamente que algo tan avanzado tecnologicamente tenga un aspecto tan org nico tan armonizado con el fenomeno mas natural la luz pero por ahora simplemente estoy encantado de tener estas c maras en mis manos porque realmente mejoran las pel culas
9154595 el proceso de interpretar al che fue para mi muy diferente de otras pel culas en las que he trabajado
9154596 en este caso trat ndose de una persona real empiezas estudiando al hombre y sus escritos esto nos condujo a siete anos de investigaci n acerca de lo que otras personas hab an escrito sobre l en cualquier caso siempre volv a a los textos que hab a escrito el mismo
9154597 hemos ido a cuba bolivia paris y miami all donde hubiera alguien de uno u otro bando que tuviera algo que contarnos uno de los factores m s interesantes de narrar una historia de la revoluci n cubana es que mucha de la gente que luch en ella sigue viva si cuentas una historia sobre la revoluci n americana la revoluci n francesa la revoluci n m xicana no queda nadie que pueda hablar de ello en primera persona
9154598 hay tres hombres que conocieron al che durante la revolucion cubana le siguieron a bolivia y sobrevivieron pombo urbano y benigno
9154599 la informaci n que los actores necesitaban de ellos era muy especifica
9154600 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9154601 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9154602 marted scorso sono venuto ad arezzo con lunica premura di aver invitato tutti i membri del comitato provinciale uscente per ringraziarli del lavoro svolto durante le elezioni ai presenti ho illustrato il programma dibattuto nellultima direzione nazionale udc
9154603 la linea politica del partito prosegue quella del segretario cesa e di pier ferdinando casini che ci pone alternativi alla sinistra e non annessi al pdl sicuri di esser la spina dorsale del partito popolare europeo in italia il mio compito come commissario quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale affinch gli organi dinformazione possano porre lattenzione su di unazione politica importante senza dar adito a polemiche strumentali che interessano solo chi le alimenta
9154604 in tal senso spiega abbiamo gi attivato nelle maggiori citt della provincia lapertura dei gazebo per la raccolta delle firme per la reintroduzione del voto di preferenza nella legge elettorale avremo poi la festa nazionale di chianciano terme 11 14 settembre p v che ci vedr protagonisti vista la vicinanza geografica dopodich avvieremo una seria verifica con gli iscritti al fine di giungere alle scadenze elettorali 2009 con una definita compagine politico amministrativa
9154605 non possiamo dunque accettare che qualcuno parli sin dora di alleanze con chicchessia chiarisce pur senza dimenticare che la nostra storia ci vede da sempre in provincia di arezzo alternativi alla sinistra in qualsivoglia amministrazione
9154606 ludc valuta positivamente le aperture che ci vengono a livello locale e regionale dagli esponenti del centro destra ma al di l di quelle non vi sono stati ancora incontri ufficiali giudico prematuro e fuorviante parlare di alleanze politiche in questo momento chi ha voglia di impegnarsi nelludc ha la possibilit di farlo sia nel partito sia nelle amministrazioni locali alla ricerca del bene comune e dellinteresse generale
9154607 we can confirm that two bodies were recovered last night from the main part of osbaston house maesbrook
9154608 the remains will be examined by a home office pathologist and post mortems are due to be carried out later today to establish the cause of death
9154609 it is going to be a painstaking and lengthy process before the full examination of the house and its surrounds is completed
9154610 in the meantime we will keep an open mind concerning what we may or may not find
9154611 no one is closer to the oil industry than gov palin
9154612 places anwr energy production front and center in the policy debate once again
9154613 shes viewed as almost anti oil shes probably pro oil from a national perspective but shes not in the pocket of big oil shes fought them at every step
9154614 there are four women and two children among the wounded only two or three need surgery others have light to moderate injuries

9154628 he is prepared to let the community determine if he is in fact suitable for the position of commissioner of police and pledge his continued commitment to the community and the people of antigua and barbuda
9154629 weve got our work cut out this coming 12 months will be the most difficult 12 months the labour party has had in a generation
9154630 weve got to rediscover that zeal which won three elections and that is a huge problem for us at the moment people are p d off with us
9154631 we really have to make our minds up are we ready to try and persuade this country to support us for another term because the next 12 months are critical its still there to play for

9154636 no a ingresso nel pdl con pd dialogo e non intese
9154637 no allingresso nel pdl e con il pd dialogo in parlamento
9154638 rafforzare unarea autonoma e centrale della politica italiana larea occupata finora dalludc e che attraverso la fase costituente si allargher a nuovi soggetti
9154639 sar un presidente ha detto che guarda al futuro e non al passato ma ricordatevi queste elezioni non sono su di me ma riguardano voi tutti
9154640 vista la grande enfasi e nello stesso tempo linconsistenza dei fatti a me attribuiti da panorama dice lex presidente del consiglio che parla subito dopo lintervento in proposito del premier silvio berlusconi non vorrei che lartificiale creazione di questo caso politico alimentasse il tentativo o la tentazione di dare vita nel tempo pi breve possibile ad una legge sulle intercettazioni telefoniche che possa sottrarre alla magistratura uno strumento che in molti casi si dimostrato indispensabile per portare in luce azioni o accadimenti utili allo svolgimento delle funzioni che le sono proprie da parte mia conclude prodi non ho alcuna contrariet al fatto che tutte le mie telefonate siano rese pubbliche
9154641 la pubblicazione di intercettazioni telefoniche riguardanti romano prodi a cui va la mia assoluta solidariet non che lennesima ripetizione di un copione gi visto e grave che ci accada e il parlamento deve sollecitamente intervenire per evitare il perpetuarsi di tali abusi che tanto profondamente incidono sulla vita dei cittadini e sulle libert fondamentali
9154642 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9154643 e necessario che anche la regione toscana nella sua veste di soggetto istituzionale coinvolto nellapprovazione del progetto della terza corsia autostradale faccia completamente la sua parte per quanto attiene la verifica delle modalit di realizzazione sia della nuova galleria del melarancio nel tratto fra certosa e scandicci che dellintero tratto autostradale in fase di realizzazione attorno a firenze
9154644 gli interessi in gioco non sono infatti di rilevanza esclusivamente locale afferma ma riguardano lintera viabilit a livello regionale e addirittura nazionale se infatti la tempistica dei lavori e la stessa fattibilit del progetto divenissero incerti si rischierebbe veramente di tagliare in due il paese e di arrecare danni incalcolabili alleconomia dellintera area fiorentina e a quella regionale
9154645 a questo punto prosegue carraresi un intervento della regione toscana attraverso i propri uffici e il pieno e tempestivo coinvolgimento di altri soggetti regionali quali lazienda sanitaria e larpat divengono veramente urgenti
9154646 di riferire su quanto accaduto gi nel corso della prima seduta consiliare di settembre
9154647 un deciso intervento affinch ogni ipotesi di cassa integrazione per i dipendenti che rischiano di rimanere inattivi a causa dello stop ai lavori venga limitato ai tempi tecnici strettamente necessari
9154648 sar un presidente ha detto che guarda al futuro e non al passato ma ricordatevi queste elezioni non sono su di me ma riguardano voi tutti
9154649 no a ingresso nel pdl con pd dialogo e non intese
9154650 se lofferta quella di entrare nel pdl noi rispondiamo di no perch ci saremmo gi entrati qualche mese prima delle elezioni e con veltroni dialogo in parlamento punto e basta senza equivoci di natura politica
9154651 e comunque facile prevedere precisa che nella gran parte dei casi sar fisiologico una conferma delle alleanze locali con le forze di centrodestra con le quali c un rapporto che dura da pi di 10 anni
9154652 proprio per questo dice cesa teniamo una posizione distinta dal partito democratico evitando di sovrapporre la collaborazione istituzionale tra le forze dellopposizione con lintese politiche che non ci sono
9154653 rafforzare unarea autonoma e centrale della politica italiana larea occupata finora dalludc e che attraverso la fase costituente si allargher a nuovi soggetti
9154654 quando il governo ci ha prospettato in parlamento alcune questioni che noi ritenevamo utili agli italiani sottolinea cesa abbiamo tenuto un atteggiamento positivo quando invece si trattato di opporci come e accaduto per il dpef abbiamo assunto una posizione critica
9154655 una riforma organica che non sia rivolta contro qualcuno ma guardi agli interessi dei cittadini
9154656 no a ingresso nel pdl con pd dialogo e non intese
9154657 no allingresso nel pdl e con il pd dialogo in parlamento
9154658 rafforzare unarea autonoma e centrale della politica italiana larea occupata finora dalludc e che attraverso la fase costituente si allargher a nuovi soggetti
9154659 svendita ad air france che il governo prodi intendeva realizzare
9154660 creare una alitalia nuova una compagnia aerea pi efficiente finanziariamente in equilibrio tecnologicamente avanzata
9154661 almeno allinizio ci sono da fare dei sacrifici perch le passate gestioni dellalitalia non possono essere cancellate con un colpo di bacchetta magica
9154662 si deve procedere a un ridimensionamento del personale il cui numero attuale non compatibile con una gestione economicamente sana dellazienda
9154663 il personale in eccedenza si trover in una situazione su cui riteniamo di dovere noi intervenire non sar certo abbandonato perch non giusto che siano i singoli a pagare gli errori delle gestioni del passato e non saranno abbandonati neppure i piccoli risparmiatori che in alitalia hanno creduto investendo in titoli azionari ed obbligazionari della compagnia
9154664 se la nuova compagnia aerea dovesse ritenere utile allearsi con una compagnia straniera questa potr entrare solo come socio di minoranza
9154665 in condizioni meno favorevoli per litalia per i lavoratori i consumatori e gli azionisti
9154666 e facile fare i miracoli con i soldi degli italiani scaricando il buco dellalitalia sulle spalle dei cittadini
9154667 per valutare limpatto che il nuovo piano di ristrutturazione di alitalia avr sulla citt di roma
9154668 c un insieme di strumenti legislativi ammortizzatori sociali in gestione al ministero del lavoro che sono pi che sufficienti a risolvere il problema
9154669 no a ingresso nel pdl con pd dialogo e non intese
9154670 no allingresso nel pdl e con il pd dialogo in parlamento
9154671 rafforzare unarea autonoma e centrale della politica italiana larea occupata finora dalludc e che attraverso la fase costituente si allargher a nuovi soggetti
9154672 la scuola ha detto deve rimettere al centro la persona e preparare i ragazzi ad essere cittadini consapevoli dei diritti e dei doveri e conoscitori dei principi costituzionali
9154673 crediamo che alla scuola serva chiarezza ha spiegato il ministro per questo ci sar un ritorno dei voti accompagnati dai giudizi che saranno esplicativi del risultato raggiunto dai ragazzi
9154674 il consiglio dei ministri ha espresso parere favorevole in merito al ritorno al maestro unico per la scuola primaria ha detto il ministro il provvedimento sar contenuto nel piano programmatico per la scuola contenuto nella finanziaria e su cui stiamo lavorando con il ministro tremonti
9154675 wir haben sehr gute vertrauensvolle beziehungen sowohl politisch als auch konomisch
9154676 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9154677 un provvedimento serio e condivisibile perch in italia esiste una vera e propria emergenza educativa a cui la scuola non pu sottrarsi
9154678 ludc ha sempre creduto fina dalla scorsa legislatura nella necessit di reintrodurre il voto in condotta e di riportare nelle aule scolastiche lo studio delleducazione civica quindi non possiamo che essere soddisfatti cera bisogno da parte del governo di un segnale forte ed arrivato conclude ciocchetti adesso spetta ai docenti rendere efficaci le nuove disposizioni
9154679 no a ingresso nel pdl con pd dialogo e non intese
9154680 no allingresso nel pdl e con il pd dialogo in parlamento
9154681 rafforzare unarea autonoma e centrale della politica italiana larea occupata finora dalludc e che attraverso la fase costituente si allargher a nuovi soggetti
9154682 con profonda gratitudine e grande umilt accetto la nomination per la presidenza degli stati uniti
9154683 a john mccain sta a cuore lamerica il problema che non capisce
9154684 che ciascuno di noi libero di vivere come vuole ma che abbiamo anche lobbligo di trattaci lun laltro con dignit e rispetto
9154685 in quando commander in chief non esiter mai a difendere questa nazione ma invier le truppe solo con una missione chiara e il sacro impegno a fornir loro quanto necessario durante la battaglia e le cure e i benefici che meritano una volta tornati a casa
9154686 sar un presidente ha concluso che guarda al futuro e non al passato ma ricordatevi queste elezioni non sono su di me ma riguardano voi tutti
9154687 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9154688 s al voto di preferenza il giovanile motore del partito
9154689 si propone come motore del partito sul territorio giovani e giovanissimi mettono a disposizione il proprio tempo libero perch credono che questa iniziativa proposta da casini in prima persona possa rafforzare la nostra democrazia in quanto pi autorevole il parlamentare eletto a seguito del voto di preferenza di migliaia di cittadini piuttosto che il parlamentare nominato insindacabile dalle segreterie di partito ridotto troppo spesso di conseguenza al ruolo di yes man
9154690 i gazebo per la raccolta delle firme saranno solo il primo impulso per rodare la macchina del gruppo giovani e raccogliere le prime impressioni delle persone illustrando nel contempo le linee guida del nostro partito che vede giorno dopo giorno premiare la coraggiosa scelta identitaria dello scorso aprile
9154691 del resto aggiunge piersante morandini coordinatore nazionale a margine dellassemblea tenuta in data 25 agosto con i giovani di arezzo lentusiasmo di arezzo contagiante non un caso che proprio ai ragazzi di arezzo richiesto uno sforzo notevole per dare il benvenuto ai giovani di tutta italia alla festa nazionale dellunione di centro che si terr a chianciano terme si dall11 al 14 settembre
9154692 il presidente pierfendinando casini sa di poter trovare nei giovani una locomotiva di entusiasmo e grinta per rinnovare dal basso questa nostra italia
9154693 non certamente casuale la citt sta divenendo sempre pi il capoluogo di tendenza della valdichiana oltre ai numerosi vip che la rendono trendy la citt sta diventando un must anche per i politici italiani indipendentemente dallo schieramento politico naturale quindi che i giovani abbiano scelto una localit cool per mettersi alla prova in vista dellimpegno che li vedr protagonisti a chianciano
9154694 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9154695 i just know that were playing great football we have for five six seven and eight weeks so were more than comfortable with where were at
9154696 theyre playing good footy and we havent got too many injuries and weve managed players time really well
9154697 we were really pleased with it we were hard to play against and we won a heap of the ball and had a lot of entries and we tackled them and it was exactly the last sort of game that youd want before a finals series
9154698 the guys who were on the fringe played really well and that was the big challenge for them shannon byrnes harry taylor brent prismall and ryan gamble all of those guys that people would presume would be first out
9154699 they played a fantastic game and thats all they could do
9154700 he played well he played about 75 per cent of the game and played with speed he had about 33 possessions and i think hes pulled up pretty well
9154701 hes just an outstanding person has outstanding leadership and he demonstrates hes such a team oriented player its great that hes in good form
9154702 well just work with the afl and whoever we end up playing wherever we play whatever day we play its almost irrelevant
9154703 the only thing that youve got to say is that were going to get a lot of votes winning 21 out of 22 matches
9154704 youd probably think that the geelong group of boys will get votes and i think theyll all poll i think jimmy will poll obviously because hes a reigning brownlow medallist and gary will and joel corey will and corey enright had an incredible patch there

9154886 what i will not do is suggest that the senator mccain takes his positions for political purposes because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism the times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook so let us agree that patriotism has no party i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america
9154887 for eighteen long months you have stood up one by one and said enough to the politics of the past
9154888 now let there be no doubt the republican nominee john mccain has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect and next week well also hear about those occasions when hes broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need
9154889 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time
9154890 the truth is on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives on health care and education and the economy senator mccain has been anything but independent
9154891 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know why else would he define middle class as someone making under 5 million a year how else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than 100 million americans how else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax peoples benefits or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college or a plan that would privatize social security and gamble your retirement its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it

9154896 se vorbeste foarte mult despre sistemul educational din romania nu sunt adeptul ideii ca sistemul educational in romania este prost sau este o catastrofa mai ales cum vorbesc unii sistemul educational a inceput sa se reformeze si sistemul universitar a dat mari valori in toate domeniile este un sistem universitar de calitate ma refer la cel public

9154902 the monon bell classic is one of the great college rivalries and we look forward to working with depauw and wabash each fall
9154903 after 114 meetings these two teams are separated by only one victory as a college football fan what more could you as for
9154904 this is a great experience for our players that most other teams in country never get to experience
9154905 the atmosphere of having over 11 000 fans in the stadium and knowing that even more are watching on live television should be tremendous
9154906 i am pleased that hdnet will once again be a part of the monon bell rivalry
9154907 alumni from both schools who are unable to attend the game in person have told us over and over again how much they enjoy gathering across the country to watch the game
9154908 were thrilled with both the quality of the presentation and the growing ubiquity of hdnet
9154909 seeing the game in high definition is the next best thing to standing on the sidelines and the three prior hdnet treatments of our rivalry game in 2003 2006 and 2007 received rave reviews its a great partnership
9154910 my son nolan and i had traveled to this travesty of a border wall built by the bush administration in southern arizona
9154911 most of the objects in this piece are from those abandoned shacks they are the things people left behind as they were fleeing from the border patrol they realized they were carrying too much so they just started throwing stuff away
9154912 we explained what we were doing there and we engaged them in conversation
9154913 turns out that when they find this stuff theyll set them up on rocks in the desert shoot them for target practice and take the ones they hit home as trophies
9154914 so you have these paramilitary guys destroying this stuff that these people were reluctantly giving up at the last minute and only because they were being weighed down by it
9154915 since that experience i have been lured to create sculpture almost exclusively from found objects
9154916 i collect explore and rescue materials the work becomes a celebration of human activity my own and acts previous to mine
9154917 i put these items together not just because theyre the right color or the right texture each object has personal significance each piece a story im reluctant to make that story obvious because i dont want to be too heavy handed about how i guide people through these
9154918 but if people build their own narratives out of these things then im delighted
9154919 the sculptures and photographs are structured on the same artistic concepts so they meld together within the exhibit literally becoming a single sculpture unto itself the visual transition is seamless
9154920 i was wandering around abandoned homesteads farmsteads railroad tracks and places other people tend not to look and i came to realize how beautiful these places are
9154921 the photos became a logical extension of the sculptural work
9154922 this abandoned interior i call clubhouse is a beautiful collection of stuff that i wished i could bring to my studio
9154923 since i couldnt i photographed it just the way i found it you could create a narrative from it in the same way you can the sculptures
9154924 i love the variations in blue blue truck blue pool blue sky the repeated forms
9154925 i was traveling with a friend of mine and as we pulled into this motel i said in the morning theres going to be a shot here i knew it i didnt sleep well that night i was up at 6 in the morning after a half hours time this shadow lowered into the pool and trucks went by even the night before in the dark i could see that shot an epiphany
9154926 what do you need to know about nature to really appreciate it
9154927 what is the relationship between knowledge and appreciation and the contrast between what were comfortable with and the fact the this symmetry and order we try to attribute to nature isnt really there
9154928 you learn things about yourself when you do a show like this
9154929 just this morning i realized for the first time that one of the first pieces completed here has a horse in it and so does the last probably a coincidence
9154930 its a piece about generations good breeding stock what you pass on to your children
9154931 we had to go through my fathers stuff and i learned things i never knew about him at the same time my two sons were home together for the first time in 15 months so we were having all these family conversations
9154932 theres no specific imagery in this piece that would necessarily lead someone to that story in fact i could tell you the story and still you wouldnt guess which piece it was about i like that ambiguity
9154933 you were not there and yet i felt the presence of my father and my son in that gallery

9155004 we wanted to specialize strictly in a service not generally offered by other cpa firms something that business owners really need we determined that selling businesses is a perfect fit for our cpa experience and background
9155005 most business owners have never before sold a business and they know very little about selling their businesses for the most money a majority of business brokers and intermediaries just dont understand the accounting tax and financial concepts involved in maximizing a businesses value
9155006 during my years as a practicing cpa i helped negotiate and structure hundreds of business deals and i was always amazed at how little some business brokers and intermediaries knew about business financial matters
9155007 my goal is to educate business owners so they can prepare their businesses to bring the highest price when the time comes for them to sell

9155065 for this next part of our journey i would like to welcome you into my own soul i know that you dont understand this and perhaps it does not hold the same value as it once did during the height of my civilization but according to my culture this is truly one of the highest honors i can bestow upon you only my late husband and some of my most trusted advisors have ever experienced what you are about to see
9155066 im not certain if any of the people from your time understand this yet but it is actually a huge sphere
9155067 so so surely aidelede the empire all rest on the top of this sphere otherwise they would fall off into nothingness right
9155068 come julian i want to show you my civilization my people the celeteri im not sure if you are quite ready to understand all of the knowledge that we have obtained throughout our extensive legacy so let us begin by starting with something familiar
9155069 this is much better i recognize some of these features the mountains in the southwest the desert over there but some things are very different though for instance i dont recognize that large lake near where aidelede should be and there is no northern forest and hmmm where is renastus
9155070 yes i suppose they must and now we will advance to my peoples capital city lorixinata
9155071 although i could simply will us there i think you will enjoy the experience more if we were to descend down through the heavens
9155072 it it is a city it has to be but its size this is impossible
9155073 this is the end result of thousands of years of ambition the crown jewel in a nation of an ambitious people who strived to master the disciplines of both science and mysticism alike this is was our beloved lorixinata capital of both our splendid nation and once the entire planet
9155074 that will be our vantage point for what i am about to both show you and explain to you
9155075 in our language it is known as xeris ixe axnastus axio or roughly translated issuer of the great ultimatum
9155076 perhaps this platform was meant to be a watchtower or perhaps to hold something
9155077 these people surely would not make such an alteration by accident given their apparent fascination with perfection
9155078 just like it was with your memory of renastus the memory i am showing you of this city is complete with visualizations representing all of the typical activity of my people as best as i can recall it those flashing lights are flying ships no doubt facilitating some form of construction or repair
9155079 no dont worry its perfectly safe sorry about that i suppose you could say that i have a flair for the melodramatic perhaps sometimes to a fault
9155080 you have been so patient with me and for this i thank you now i will explain to you how my illustrious nation came to be how all that you have seen became possible and also how our once great civilization fell from its precipice of glory and power
9155081 from the little we know of the first of mankind we gather they were a nomadic tribe that wandered about the earth in search of food and shelter
9155082 perhaps two thousand years before any developed civilization began keeping written historical records mankind was purported to have been spoken to and possibly physiologically enhanced by a series of divine beings entities we later in our history identified as gods although the people of your time have now assigned them with different names i suspect they are the same eight ones that were once worshipped by both the celeteri and their precursors
9155083 perhaps seeing the potential in man perhaps for their own amusement or perhaps for some other obscure purpose the gods then allegedly decided to grant mankind free access to both their creative and destructive powers theories about their intent differed wildly among philosophers and theologians near the height of the celeteri nation thus even now we can only attempt to speculate the true purpose for the gods making this sudden change to their creation despite what you may have heard from the ravings of lunatics it is my understanding the gods have never truly spoken to us again since their purported initial communication with prehistoric man in ancient times
9155084 but that doesnt seem to be how mysticism works in my world
9155085 foremost not everyone can use magic and even then when one who is able to use it does so the costs are often devastating
9155086 i think that you will understand everything after i finish telling you the story of my people
9155087 although some initially sought only to use the power of the gods destructively they were the exception in general people now dispersed all over the planet due to their increasing numbers collectively tended to use the gods gift to create allowing for the ascension of several great nations to come about over a few thousand years time
9155088 after perhaps centuries of peace following the creation of these concurrent civilizations who for the most part had all taken a liking to a particular deity and thus all became largely monotheistic eventually their borders began to expand to the point where both theological and political tensions began to rise in time these societal differences became unmanageable and they consequently led to a series of confrontations that sparked a full scale theologically fueled world war with each nation fighting under the banner of its chosen patron deity
9155089 and those accursed gods just sat there in the sky and watched it happen
9155090 we won should one choose to refer to the outcome with such a positive word it was long before i personally existed the celeteri were a different people then
9155091 united under the celeteri and their new king enixalaxios all of the former nations began to rebuild as travel between the nations increased lorixinata now effectively the new capital of the world suddenly became a repository for the contributions of mystics philosophers and xanixie literally translated as logics precursors to scientists from every part of the planet this collection of the cumulative knowledge of all humanity then grew exponentially as the rich intellectual aura of the city attracted the greatest minds of the world who then began to make new discoveries as they collaborated their efforts the resulting era of enlightenment is generally credited as having been directly responsible for giving birth to the field of science within our society
9155092 as the field of science began to flourish it quickly gained momentum and became a dominating force within the nation although mysticism and science were conventionally perceived as antipodes the scientists cleverly gained the upper hand by beginning to dissect the principles of magic logically studying it just as if it were any other natural phenomenon against this tactic the mystics had little defense as the sacred texts they held up as proof of their assertions regarding topics such as the meaning of life the plan of the gods for mankind and the proper code of ethics for a society and so forth were written long ago by unknown individuals whose credibility could be neither verified or scholastically defended seeing great potential in the victory of the scientists as he felt it would allow the nation to maintain a more peaceful humanistic existence based on its demystification of the gods and their associated metaphysical energy as well as reduce the meddlesome influence that the mystics exercised over the nations governing bodies enixalaxios famously directed a great deal of the nations wealth over several decades unfairly towards their cause an act that eventually led to the combination of the two specialties into a single scholastically based discipline which was very much more science than it was mysticism as well as the descent of the temple in the nation from a conduit to the gods to little more than a place for people to halfheartedly vent their personal frustrations to anyone willing to listen
9155093 summoning his firstborn son axinethon enixalaxios told the young prince he was to devote his life as the new king of the celeteri towards ending human suffering as he had been a fine ruler the nation mourned for some time over his loss
9155094 and devoted much of the nations resources to advancing science and now by proxy the understanding of magic great wonders were achieved during his reign disease and hunger were completely irradiated and scientists mastered the combination of machinery and magic used to make the flying ship that you saw earlier we have a word for it in our language but there is no way to directly translate it into yours
9155095 i think using a combination of words from your language it would best be dubbed something like technomancy
9155096 although king axinethons efforts were valiant after another two centuries his health also began to suffer greatly thus to his son prince thaxalathri my future husband he issued a challenge that almost seemed unfair he told him that during his reign the celeteri must conquer death thus reaching the terminus of human development and finally severing themselves completely from the will of the gods i remember the look on my then fianc es face as he left that bedroom it was if his father had already passed away
9155097 following the mourning period after axinethons death we worked together feverishly to find a solution to this problem much to the surprise of the royal courtiers we never even bothered to have an official wedding just a swift public ceremony in order to ensure that the rights of succession would be in order we were both so young so ambitious so brilliant we were sure we would find the solution and low and behold after almost a century we finally did
9155098 of course many of the sacred texts contained accounts of it happening for some special purpose designed by the gods but we suspected that our advanced understanding of science and mysticism could help us to reproduce the phenomenon and after a great deal of research we were successful
9155099 that feeling in your stomach is the reason that we had to legislate the process a bit
9155100 thus we made a series of laws that regulated age limits for when couples and families could be reunited after undergoing the procedure these laws were designed to prevent our society from becoming too confusing we also made laws regarding the treatment of chronic suicide cases as well
9155101 in time both i and thaxalathri were beginning to get to the age where we would both soon need to undergo the restoration process
9155102 however there was a problem brewing when the practice of reincarnation first spread throughout the nation it was regarded with a certain awe as a miracle of science and magic combined and it was thus more of a novelty to either be reborn or to accept a twice born child a thrice born child and so forth into ones home thus initially people still continued to have children and raise sizable families much as they had since the dawn of our civilization without much thought about the recent breakthrough the host parents would raise the reincarnated newborns as their own then allow the children to leave or not when and if they chose to but many restored children left as soon as they were legally allowed to do so since caring for a restored child was regarded as a service to the celetari people the host parents were duly compensated by the government for their services however as the procedure became increasingly widespread some people across the nation gradually began to fear death less and less and others became frustrated with having to raise so many restored children before finally getting the opportunity to raise a first born child thus an interesting sociological change rapidly took place everyone simply started having dramatically fewer children and many had none
9155103 although we had some notion that many people began to contemplate waiting a few lifetimes to pursue their dreams before settling down and having a family and many more had become disgusted with the entire system altogether we had no idea how quickly the problem got out of hand
9155104 of course thaxalathri was not the only one who was claimed by this sudden deluge that struck our society thousands of souls were lost in the coming weeks the few remaining mystics prayed to their gods which of course was a fruitless endeavor but the scientists were of no use either for in all of their brilliance they were not able to predict such a simple problem before it occurred and after it did they offered me as i was now the nations leader no feasible solution to remedy it thus i had to make a choice and i did
9155105 and who decided which people were worthy of another lifetime
9155106 we tried our very best to make the selection process as just as possible but of course as time passed and the birth rate continued to remain too low to sustain a stable population many people became upset about the decision some radicals then took to labeling the law as part of an elitist agenda intended to purify our race an accusation which almost caused a civil war although the war was eventually prevented by dispatching both the radicals and their supporters the sentiment these traitors left behind the conspiracy theory about race purification prompted many to refrain from having children in protest which further compounded our problems
9155107 unfortunately i required the procedure right before the height of the ridiculous speculations about race purification came about thus the radicals used my reincarnation to lend greater credence to their lies as thaxalathri and i had no children in my nearly two decade long hiatus from the throne a reagent assumed command of the nation but was eventually assassinated poisoned how dreadfully barbaric which almost caused the civil war i spoke of earlier
9155108 i reassumed the throne early after only eighteen years of being away
9155109 then i had the radicals executed and aside from the unrest derived from many peoples contemporary refusal to bear children a relative state of peace was restored to the nation luckily some of the scientists that had been saved by my restrictions on reincarnation were able to find a way to dramatically extend human life some ten years after i regained power thus rising from the crisis as a sociologically harmonized nation we rejoiced greatly
9155110 unfortunately the fanfare did not last for very long for some
9155111 at the height of the reincarnation crisis many of the mystics had predicted that the end of the world was at hand they claimed the reincarnation crisis was a punishment from the gods fueled by what they referred to as the insatiable zeal of the celeteri nation of course when our scientists saved us with the gift of near immortality the lot of these fools found themselves in a precarious predicament they had lost considerable credibility with their followers in a trade where the only currency the only substance was faith as such it seemed to many that the age of mysticism within the celeteri nation was finally coming to an end and here is the rest of the chapter since it wouldnt all fit in the first portion of the blog personally although i did nothing to accelerate the secularization of the celeteri i initially welcomed it i had never had much regard for the sacred scriptures nor the gods as i felt that the ingenuity and diligence of mankind was all that we needed in order to prevail in secret on account of my position i had in fact always doubted the existence of the gods and had assumed that the metaphysical powers wielded by our people were either a result of some type of non corporeal connection with the world around us or somehow came from within our person in a manner that our scientists had not yet discovered at any rate the mystics bitter over their recent and rather empirical upset when the world was saved by my appointed council of scientists decided they would continue to stir up trouble in our society by openly accusing me of genocide apparently they had gone back and looked through the records detailing whom my emergency council had allowed to undergo reincarnation and had decided that the panel had unfairly blocked the reincarnation requests of some 100 prominent theologians whereas absolutely none of the scientists that had applied for the procedure had been turned down
9155112 at first i couldnt believe it here we were not even a year after i had led our civilization to realize such an amazing achievement and already these impudent fools were spoiling it for everyone so i went back and looked at the records from the reincarnation board myself and it turned out the mystics were right the board had clearly chosen scientists first and mystics last well so what i asked myself obviously they made the right choice because here we all are eventually i decided that the best thing to do was to make a public address about the issue where i would explain that the celeteri had just been through some very trying times and that we now needed to work towards maintaining the unity within our society that contemporarily seemed so prevalent but i never got the chance as it turns out i was so loved by the people that when they caught wind of the accusations about me being made by the mystics they violently rebelled against them and even started to murder a few of the most vocal proponents of the accusations

9155168 demonstrates the ability of its lead molecules to work as effective drugs
9155169 allowed the company to demonstrate that it has assembled all the required pieces of the competitive jigsaw to enable its proprietary phylomer drug discovery platform to compete on the world stage
9155170 world class equivalence and provides significant validation that the phylogica technology can repeatedly and consistently generate high quality hits that are suitable for drug development
9155171 using a combination of standard and in house techniques we have been able to improve the effective potency of some of our lead molecules several hundred fold
9155172 extend circulation time in rats significantly without losing efficacy of the molecule
9155173 these improvements in drug like characteristics of peptides such as phylomers are important for their commercial viability in order to allow a realistic cost of goods per dose and tolerable administration regimes for patients
9155174 jigsaw puzzle for phylogica proving that our drug leads can be easily modified to meet industry standards
9155175 with these validating experiments successfully concluded the company is now well placed to continue to showcase its technology to logical partners
9155176 as more and more drugs undergo patent expiry the pharmaceutical industry is increasingly looking for next generation technologies that can help address rapidly dwindling drug pipelines

9155182 it is going to be a painstaking and lengthy process before the full examination of the house and its surrounds is completed
9155183 in the meantime we will keep an open mind concerning what we may or may not find

9155206 hezbollah succeeded in incorporating the idea of resistance as part of the international anti globalization movements
9155207 through our contacts with these groups we have managed to challenge the idea that hezbollah is a dogmatic terrorist islamist organization and convince part of the international left that we can be a strong partner
9155208 we think of the sacrifices of all the militants in lebanon and palestine and the arab world from islamists to nationalists to arabists or any ideological background they come from
9155209 hezbollah is aware today of the importance of cultivating contacts with the west
9155210 social forums are open spaces of discussion they present an opportunity for a group like hezbollah to participate and give their opinions
9155211 it was a potent symbol that right makes might and that a guerrilla ready to fight for its people can succeed
9155212 some leftist groups refuse to consider what islamist organizations are about their oppressive practices their violations of rights their dogmatic rhetoric
9155213 they are refugees now because they have left their homes they are living in the forests and they should be brought back
9155214 it is the responsibility of the government that these refugees should be brought back and also to send for force if necessary to stop this killing to stop this burning to stop this looting

9155236 the fourth round of talks was delayed twice and is now scheduled for saturday and we are waiting for it to be held

9155240 i have recently written to chief ministers to consider opening up the public stock of buildings of educational institutions of the high school level and above after class hours for those agencies and groups who are engaged in skill development for our youth
9155241 i hope chief ministers will respond positively and agencies that promote skill development in the private and public sector will be able to utilize these new opportunities
9155242 this sector provides employment to over 42 million people it contributes about 45 percent of the total manufacturing output and nearly 40 percent of indias exports

9155280 in view of this i made the decision that i couldnt go ahead with my scheduled meeting with mr nami

9155312 we must stay calm i was completely calm i state the reasons why i couldnt continue discussions i think it was a calm and correct decision when they are ready to truly talk then we will see what to do
9155313 because it is not possible for negotiations to be taking place under such shadows and provocative actions
9155314 for two days i had been preparing to comment discuss and negotiate these issues

9155323 i have a contract with real madrid but as everyone knows talks are taking place
9155324 i always wanted to come back at a time when i can still play rather than at 35 36 when the legs have gone
9155325 to have two promotions and get in the premier league is what dreams are made of and i am really enjoying it
9155326 he is a smart horse and certainly not one you want to be turning down in the big races
9155327 i think the connections are looking forward to getting him back on a right handed track and the softer the ground the better for him
9155328 he has maybe been a bit below par on his last couple of runs and i think he was expected to win the coronation cup but he is still a very nice horse
9155329 the manager has decided to change it and ive got no problem with that
9155330 i enjoyed being captain but it wont affect my performances
9155331 you always need to set you targets high and that is taking points off the top four
9155332 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
9155333 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
9155334 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
9155335 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
9155336 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
9155337 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
9155338 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
9155339 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
9155340 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
9155341 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
9155342 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
9155343 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base

9155348 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
9155349 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
9155350 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

9155359 i arrived at ledra palace at 3pm and after the initial compliments mr zerihoun informed me that he had received a letter from the turkish cypriots informing him that they would deny entry to the kato pyrgos residents for an organised pilgrimage through the limnitis road
9155360 this of course is very sad news it is truly a small hearted and provocative decision
9155361 in view of this i made the decision that i couldnt go ahead with my scheduled meeting with mr nami
9155362 i responded that i was definitely willing to meet whenever he wanted to discuss these issues which not only are a result of todays meeting but also the many others that preceded this one regarding the opening of the limnitis checkpoint
9155363 mr nami was there when i arrived and indeed we started a preliminary discussion but i think mr nami felt the need to inform me of this development so he interrupted and told me about it
9155364 but he did express the hope that this would not affect the talks that will begin on september 3

9155387 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
9155388 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
9155389 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
9155390 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
9155391 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
9155392 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
9155393 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
9155394 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
9155395 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
9155396 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
9155397 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
9155398 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
9155399 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
9155400 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
9155401 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
9155402 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
9155403 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
9155404 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
9155405 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
9155406 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
9155407 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
9155408 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
9155409 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
9155410 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
9155411 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
9155412 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
9155413 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
9155414 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
9155415 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
9155416 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
9155417 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
9155418 who are open to doing something on the production side
9155419 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
9155420 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
9155421 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
9155422 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
9155423 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
9155424 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
9155425 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
9155426 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
9155427 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
9155428 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
9155429 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
9155430 this is unacceptable as government we shall respect and protect religious and customary rights at all times
9155431 i felt extremely vulnerable and it affected my work after i was forced to take off my marriage string for the first time since i got married 23 years ago
9155432 my husband understood that i was forced to do so because of the ruling at work but i felt very uncomfortable about it in the presence of my father in law with whom we live and who waits in the reception area to collect me after work every day
9155433 i believe and respect the red dot as it symbolises the marital status of a hindu woman just as we respect the right of married women to wear their wedding rings we also believe that similar treatment and respect must be accorded to hindu women wearing their powdered dots stick on or liquid
9155434 what is seriously concerning is that we are tolerant and accommodative of women who apply cosmetic powder on the whole face but intolerant when other women exercise their customary and religious rights by placing a powdered dot on their forehead
9155435 only a couple of them have suffered major injuries while others have already been treated and released to the respective wards after small surgeries
9155436 what weve ascertained is that due legal process is not available in colombia because lawyers have no access to justice
9155437 the simple act of exercising the right to seek justice is perceived as a subversive action many of our colleagues have suffered harassment and received death threats
9155438 here in colombia even the minimal international standard for independence of the legal profession is not being met without those requirements there is no rule of law
9155439 we call on the state entities responsible for the protection of civil liberties and human rights to take urgent action to remedy this situation
9155440 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
9155441 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
9155442 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
9155443 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

9155448 the department of state is extremely sensitive to your concerns and we are cognisant of the human rights abuses modi has committed
9155449 we have thoroughly searched department records and located no current non immigrant visa applications for modi however should we receive an application we assure you it will be adjudicated in strict accordance with the immigration and naturalisation act
9155450 the current response from the state department has virtually made narendra modi a persona non grata to the us

9155454 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
9155455 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9155456 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9155457 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
9155458 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
9155459 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
9155460 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
9155461 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9155462 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9155463 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9155464 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
9155465 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
9155466 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
9155467 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
9155468 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9155469 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9155470 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
9155471 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

9155478 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
9155479 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
9155480 it is now more important than ever that those large number of people with different coloured skin join in with british society the problem comes when large numbers of people of all ethnicities are not willing to use the language are abusing our system and demanding that laws are changed to accommodate them
9155481 this is a measure of the extent to which uncontrolled immigration is changing the nature of our society against the wishes of a very large majority
9155482 immigration is now expected to account for 70 percent of our population increase in the next 25 years this means we will have to build a city the size of birmingham every three or four years to sustain the newcomers
9155483 we are now marrying people from different countries and society is becoming more tolerant of different races
9155484 were living in a different population now than we were 20 or 30 years ago the figures show that older generations of black and ethnic minorities who have grown up in this country are now comfortable enough to raise their children here
9155485 the nations population now stands at almost 61 million up two million since 2001 and even if the tide of new arrivals does begin to turn the population will continue to rise the figures show why because established migrants are each on average having more children than british born women and last year they accounted for 23 percent of all births 54 percent of those in london
9155486 the strain placed on schools and hospitals totally unprepared for the influx of migrants since 1997 which by itself has added 1 2 million to the population will be enormous for years to come
9155487 focus on the fall in the number of arrivals from poland and its neighbours

9155489 it is a 90 minute fun filled film with four and a half minutes of animation where the two children take the audience for a joy ride

9155496 fromsms service was inspired by our own needs having customers in many countries and end users all over the world we often encountered issues with sms roaming character encoding and restrictions of so called short numbers as many web applications can benefit from sms messaging interface we decided to make fromsms available for everybody
9155497 the existing services on the market are suitable for sending of bulk sms messages and for premium priced sms services but many web applications dont have those kinds of needs
9155498 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
9155499 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
9155500 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
9155501 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
9155502 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
9155503 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
9155504 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
9155505 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
9155506 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
9155507 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
9155508 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
9155509 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
9155510 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
9155511 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9155512 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
9155513 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
9155514 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
9155515 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
9155516 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
9155517 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
9155518 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
9155519 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
9155520 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
9155521 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9155522 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
9155523 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9155524 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
9155525 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
9155526 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
9155527 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
9155528 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
9155529 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
9155530 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
9155531 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
9155532 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
9155533 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
9155534 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
9155535 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
9155536 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
9155537 it was a big one it lasted several seconds but then everything was fine again
9155538 mondays defeat was an off day and well put it down as a one off local amp nations
9155539 the biggest strength about our squad is that everybody knows everybody elses jobs if they keep each other at the their tasks the depth in the squad will show through
9155540 the most difficult people to keep their feet on the ground is the fans theyll see a table we wont look at until 10 games
9155541 its a great game for us weve got the table toppers with a 100 record something for the fans to see and something for the players to aim at knocking off
9155542 we know its going to be a tough game but if we do our things right then we can win any game
9155543 i thought in pre season we looked difficult to beat wed got rid of the habit of throwing goals away
9155544 i wasnt happy with the colchester game but they werent much better than us we just gave silly goals away
9155545 if we can get to the tempo we did against leyton orient then im sure well get a good performance at home local amp nations
9155546 i saw leeds against crystal palace on tuesday they rotated their side quite a lot from the game at yeovil but they passed the ball well we know what to expect but there are areas we can exploit
9155547 last year we played well there but got nothing so we want to go one better this time although we will need an intense performance to get the better of them
9155548 what could be safer than living next to a cop
9155549 ik maak ook ruzie met mijn vrouw wij kunnen heel goed ruzie maken
9155550 sommigen hebben nooit ruzie met hun partner maar dat geloof ik niet
9155551 wie me ook enorm raakt is mijn dochter ze doet ballet als ze op een podium staat moet ik huilen
9155552 ik ben weinig bezig met mijn uiterlijk ik doe wat gel in mijn haar en drink een actimelleke
9155553 naar de zonnebank doe ik nooit als ik een half uur in de zon loop ben ik al bruin
9155554 ich will nach hause ich habe mit dieser ganzen sache nichts zu tun
9155555 voor ik de bal krijg moet ik al weten waar mijn ploegmaats staan dat vergt tijd
9155556 ik ben niet blij met mijn plaats op de bank maar ik voel me geen slachtoffer van de slechte start
9155557 natuurlijk krijg ik meer kritiek mijn positie is niet te vergelijken met een links of rechtsback

9155560 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
9155561 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
9155562 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
9155563 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9155564 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

9155566 he is a smart horse and certainly not one you want to be turning down in the big races
9155567 i think the connections are looking forward to getting him back on a right handed track and the softer the ground the better for him
9155568 he has maybe been a bit below par on his last couple of runs and i think he was expected to win the coronation cup but he is still a very nice horse
9155569 i have a contract with real madrid but as everyone knows talks are taking place
9155570 i am thrilled to continue to be a part of the sycuan family and after serious discussions with scott woodworth and sean gibbons of sycuan i believe i will have the opportunity to fight antonio margarito joshua clottey or miguel cotto
9155571 the greatest of fighters have suffered losses and have come back stronger than before
9155572 i always wanted to come back at a time when i can still play rather than at 35 36 when the legs have gone
9155573 to have two promotions and get in the premier league is what dreams are made of and i am really enjoying it

9155589 this could not have happened without the knowledge and consent of top leadership of the congress and the government the nation expects sonia gandhi and manmohan singh to break their silence on this unprecedented scandal
9155590 however i would like to warn the congress leaders and the government that any attempt to cover up truth in this scandal as was done by the joint parliamentary committee in the bofors case will not be tolerated by people that happened in 1989 it will happen again in 2009
9155591 nobody not even our critics accused us of having indulged in horse trading to retain power
9155592 dear herr hitler love is the greatest thing in the world so will you accept from me these poems that you may allow the young people of your nation to have them
9155593 whether its the voters list the evms or the voter i cards we have ensured that everything is in place by the middle of the next month
9155594 were pleased they took note and made sure they were properly licensed even if only for a day or week
9155595 well its always though safer in politics to avoid risk to just kind of go along with the status quo but i didnt get into government to do the safe and easy things a ship in harbor is safe but thats not why the ship is built politics isnt just a game of competing interests and clashing parties the people of america expect us to seek public office and to serve for the right reasons
9155596 i see you havent been practicing your piano for a long time huh
9155597 other studies have suggested that there are differences between men and women in response to different antidepressants but the evidence has been conflicting
9155598 this study is large enough and we were able to control for enough complicating factors that we feel confident there is a true difference these results have clear implications for the clinical treatment of depression
9155599 to our knowledge this is the first report of a direct association between childhood abuse and asthma and asthma related outcomes
9155600 we wanted to explore whether exposure to stress and violence is associated with an increased risk of asthma in urban children living in puerto rico
9155601 we already know that there is a high prevalence of asthma in puerto rican children and many studies have linked stress and exposure to violence to health problems in childhood including asthma
9155602 children with a history of abuse had higher frequencies of all outcomes of interest than those without a history of abuse after adjusting for relevant covariates history of abuse was associated with an approximate doubling of the odds of current asthma healthcare use for asthma and allergic rhinitis
9155603 a baby whale mistook a ship vessel for his mum
9155604 we were disappointed not to find a smoking gun that would explain the common association between obesity and asthma
9155605 however this research points us to other possibilities that future research should examine
9155606 we hypothesized that the low grade systemic inflammation present in obesity would augment the inflammation of asthma a synergistic effect
9155607 or alternatively that the inflammation of obesity might affect the airways independently an additive effect perhaps resulting in mixed airway inflammation
9155608 what we found was that although inflammatory cells and other biomarkers of inflammation were increased there was no significant interaction demonstrated between obesity and asthma
9155609 ive been looking forward to this for a while now our team can be really good this year
9155610 this preseason ranking is a great place for us to start our climb
9155611 the senior class experience is strong and they have great leadership

9155623 mccain clearly sees the power of women voters in this election but has just as clearly failed to support any of the issues that they care about
9155624 its basically the equivalent of a midnight raid behind enemy lines
9155625 hillary said she made 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling well mccain just shattered it
9155626 this is one more step in a long march for womens history
9155627 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9155628 demonstrated that he would not get boxed in by convention as he sought to put a woman next in line to the presidency for the first time
9155629 mccain had to protect his reputation as an opponent of status quo washington he had to pick someone with the shortest washington resume he did that he picked someone the right wing is going to be happy about but its a gamble
9155630 the question is what does it do to the argument that obamas not ready
9155631 hes chosen a washington outsider who will be an ally for him in shaking up the way things are done this is someone with solid conservative credentials but solid credentials as a reformer and its clear after watching todays event no one is going to push sarah palin around not barack obama and not joe biden

9155645 ich kann nicht sagen wie gl cklich ich bin coquest racing dieses wochenende helfen zu k nnen und meinen ersten start in der indycar zu absolvieren
9155646 nat rlich wird es f r ihn eine gro e herausforderung sein weil er vor dem rennen nicht so viel zeit im auto verbringen wird aber alex ist sehr erfahren besonders auf stra enkursen und er war hier in der vergangenheit auch schon unterwegs ich denke er wird sich an seine neue umgebung schnell anpassen und es wird sehr interessant sein zu sehen wie er sich dieses wochenende so anstellt
9155647 ich konnte aufgrund meiner linken hand heute nicht alles geben ich kam in die boxen und hatte nur eine hand am lenkrad es war einfach unm glich mein bestes zu geben die strecke ist sehr bucklig und das war f r meine hand einfach zu viel ich verpasse dieses rennen nur ungern aber lieber berlasse ich dieses wochenende alex tagliani das auto um die verletzung nicht noch schlimmer zu machen
9155648 die einzige gerade die es gibt ist auch nicht ganz gerade
9155649 du bist immer am arbeiten und du hast nicht zeit dich auszuruhen wie zum beispiel in hockenheim
9155650 man ist immer sch n besch ftigt es gibt wenig pausen was mir nicht zu schaffen macht im gegenteil da wird einem auf jeden fall nicht langweilig
9155651 ich bin hier schon zwei mal rennen gefahren und hatte noch nie probleme
9155652 die pausen sind etwas k rzer ganz klar aber da man ja nur zwei etwas schnellere kurven hat und der rest berschaubar ist ist das kein problem
9155653 wenn man da runter f hrt ist man jedes mal berrascht wie stark die kompression ist
9155654 das macht viel spa es ist eine tolle kurve sie ist sicher einzigartig in der welt
9155655 so wie eine eau rouge einzigartig ist geh rt diese auch zu den tollsten kurven in der welt
9155656 wenn man da runter f hrt ist man jedes mal berrascht wie stark die kompression ist in einem dtm fahrzeug ist sie sicherlich etwas st rker da mehr gewicht da ist als in einem formelfahrzeug
9155657 es ist ein bisschen wir in einer achterbahn wenn du unter bist sp rst du die g kr fte ein bisschen wie die eau rouge aber nicht so extrem
9155658 das auto setzt richtig auf und man merkt das auch am r cken
9155659 man h rt es im auto und wird richtig reingedr ckt
9155660 paddock hill ist die erste ecke die auf die nackenmuskulatur geht
9155661 im f nften gang ist sie eine der schnellsten kurven die wir im kalender haben
9155662 von au en sieht sie nicht so schwierig aus aber man muss eine gute linie finden wir hatten ein kleines setupproblem mit der aufh ngung aber ich muss auch noch weiter an meiner linie arbeiten am samstag werde ich fr her bremsen und die kurvenausg nge besser treffen ich bin hier um zu lernen danach sehen wir weiter
9155663 war wichtig denn meine leistung dort sollte dar ber entscheiden ob ich auch hier fahren w rde der freitag und samstag waren nicht schlecht aber am sonntag ging meine kupplung kaputt nichtsdestotrotz habe ich viel gelernt und m chte so weitermachen
9155664 wenn man seine ersten trockenen runden auf einem neuen stadtkurs im qualifying f hrt ist das sicherlich nicht optimal unser auto war heute allerdings auch nicht so gut wir haben bis zum rennen noch einiges zu erledigen die strecke ist einfach unheimlich wellig
9155665 das war ein tag zum vergessen mit sehr schwierigen bedingungen wir hatten berhaupt keine zeit ein vern nftiges setup herauszufahren das wird ein hartes rennen f r uns aber wir werden versuchen noch etwas im warm up zu finden dann schauen wir mal was im rennen passiert
9155666 ich konnte leider nicht ganz so viele runden fahren und immer unter verschiedenen bedingungen aber darauf muss ich mich einfach einstellen morgen im warm up wird es trocken sein dann habe ich noch ein paar runden und im rennen ist es dann sowieso immer etwas anderes ich bleibe zuversichtlich
9155667 wenn man einen tag sucht an dem die schwierigsten bedingungen f r unseren r10 tdi herrschen dann war dieser tag genau der richtige wir m gen geraden glatte strecken und viel grip hier haben wir enge kurven eine menge bodenwellen und wegen des regens berhaupt keinen grip auf dieser art von strecke m ssen wir auch viel an der abstimmung arbeiten auch das war wegen des regens nicht m glich wir haben im qualifying getan was wir tun konnten morgen ist ein neuer tag wir haben schon oft gezeigt dass wir im rennen viel st rker sind wir k nnen nur davon profitieren dass mehr riefenabrieb auf die strecke kommt
9155668 das war ein schwieriger tag wir hatten weder zeit ein vern nftiges setup zu machen noch die fahrer an die strecke zu gew hnen ich bin sicher dass noch viel mehr im auto steckt

9155671 but at least in the short term it will shake up the race and leave some asking why senator obama didnt pick senator clinton to be his veep
9155672 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain
9155673 while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9155674 without hillary being the nominee its really quite equally as important
9155675 there are a lot of women who are disaffected by how hillary was treated by the media by how she was treated by the obama campaign not speaking up when sexism raised its ugly head in the media
9155676 the mission is clear the next 67 days im going to take our campaign to every part of our country and our message of reform to every voter of every background in every political party or no party at all
9155677 politics isnt just a game of competing interests and clashing parties
9155678 shes exactly who i need shes exactly who this country needs to help me fight the same old washington politics of me first and country second
9155679 it is yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward governor palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9155680 on the day of bidens announcement the mccain campaign put out a hatchet job statement and television ad before mccain later called to congratulate biden and then the campaign publicized that
9155681 she seems like a compelling person with a terrific personal story
9155682 im sure that she will help make the case for republicans unfortunately the case is more of the same and so ultimately
9155683 wants to take the country in the wrong direction im assuming governor palin agrees with him and his policies
9155684 one more indicator of this country moving forward one more hit against that glass ceiling
9155685 i think that campaigns start getting these hair triggers and the statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments
9155686 wed forgiven him but we have no control over the criminal system
9155687 he refused to fight it he said that he didnt want chemotherapy that he didnt want to put poison in his body
9155688 he helped so many people in his career but didnt ask anybody to help him everybody who knows him is absolutely stunned
9155689 he was well thought of in the department he had an excellent reputation
9155690 he was one of the nicest smartest detectives you could ever meet nobody knew the difference between right and wrong better than him
9155691 shes a fairly articulate spokesperson for the pro drilling view that will provide an interesting contrast to the opposition
9155692 shes taken the ethical high ground and distanced herself from veco
9155693 she also has attempted to reverse the course established by the murkowski administration which was one where the administration directly negotiated with the oil industry in secret
9155694 gov palin certainly showed leadership on the gas line if senator mccain happens to be elected as president that would put a strong representative in the administration in washington thats in favor of an alaska gas line
9155695 many people said that about her in terms of being governor and i think shes done an excellent job
9155696 we had bad fishing year that year so we didnt have any money
9155697 so we decided to spend 35 bucks and go down to the courthouse

9155700 theyre pretty heavy the double headed ones some of my men had to grab them two men at a time
9155701 he removed the tops or he removed the ground pole
9155702 hes been in trouble many times before but never been able to find his way out of it
9155703 hes been arrested so many times but the mother keeps bailing him out
9155704 holy cow im just kind of speechless on the whole thing
9155705 he said make sure you listen to the news from hunting camp i should have put two and two together
9155706 id rather go moose hunting than be involved with politics
9155707 this is a disturbing case in that the defendant is alleged to have invaded his victims privacy in the place she should feel safest her home
9155708 he was in fact booking more speaking engagements and had increased his price
9155709 i never speculate on what ill do until i see a piece of legislation
9155710 but everything theyve done ive given careful consideration to usually they know where we stand before they vote on something not always usually where we stand before they vote is where we come out
9155711 i dont think were going to send him a bill until we know where he stands
9155712 at some point im going to call for a vote

9155809 maar wanneer ik zeg dat het belangrijk is ons in deze deugd te oefenen kijken mensen mij vreemd aan fouten maken gaat vanzelf waarom zouden we ons daar in moeten bekwamen
9155810 dat zegt u nu met een ondertoon van minachting in uw stem maar dit is een clich van belang want in werkelijkheid willen de meesten van ons helemaal geen fouten maken durven ze ook niet te maken en denken ook helemaal niet iets van hun fouten te kunnen leren we leggen zon clich snel op tafel maar leven er niet naar
9155811 omdat we dan ons mensbeeld zouden moeten aanpassen wij geven allemaal graag hoog op van ons mens zijn het loopt als een rode draad door de westerse wijsbegeerte de mens onderscheidt zich van de dieren omdat hij de rede weet te gebruiken hij kan nadenken over welke handelingen hij dient te stellen en eenmaal duidelijk wat er gedaan dient te worden dan zal dat ook gebeuren weet je wat het goede is dan zal je toch niet nalaten om dat te realiseren maar als ik kijk naar echte mensen van vlees en bloed dan zie ik geen hoogrationele wezens ik zie mensen die wel proberen hun best te doen maar toch mislukken denken dat ze het weten maar zich pijnlijk vergissen denken dat ze helpen maar de zaak volkomen in de war sturen als ik aan zon wezen een naam zou moeten toekennen dan zie ik er maar n een prutser
9155812 dat betwijfel ik waar het om gaat is niet zozeer dat mensen prutsers zijn maar dat er ook een besef van is met andere woorden de prutser die weet dat hij een prutser is zal ook accepteren dat hij feilbaar is vraagt u natuurlijk wat schieten we daar mee op
9155813 als we de deugd van het durven fouten maken meer beoefenen en het mensbeeld dat wij prutsers zijn wijd verspreid raakt leidt dit ertoe dat uitzonderlijke prestaties beter op waarde geschat worden dit is een van de redenen dat ik de nachtwacht zo waardeer niet alleen vanwege de intrinsieke waarde of schoonheid van het schilderij maar ook vanwege het besef dat bijna geen mens tot zoiets is in staat is
9155814 licht accentueert het donker altijd maar daar gaat het me nu niet om rembrandt was in zijn dagelijks leven ook vaak een prutser denk aan al de opdrachten die hij is misgelopen zijn huwelijksleven dat niet altijd over rozen ging maar in zijn werk is hij een aantal keer tot uitzonderlijke hoogte gestegen die uitschieters tonen mij dat wij hoezeer wij allen ook prutsers zijn enkele keren in ons leven in staat zijn boven onszelf uit te stijgen u denkt dat wij nooit meer iets maken dat foutloos is als wij accepteren dat wij prutsers zijn naar mijn idee is het precies andersom wij zijn wij vaker in staat iets bijzonders te produceren als wij accepteren dat wij prutsers zijn ik bedoel hiermee niet dat wij prutsers nu altijd een excuus hebben voor stomme fouten de deugd is van oudsher het ultieme midden dat geldt ook voor durven fouten te maken wie een absolute puinhoop maakt van zijn leven ten nadele van anderen en dat vervolgens vergoelijkt met de opmerking dat wij maar prutsers zijn bevindt zich aan het ene uiterste van die lijn zo iemand wordt in economische en ethische literatuur wel omschreven als de vrijbuiter die zich niets aan anderen gelegen laat liggen maar er wel op rekent dat uitgerekend die anderen zich netjes en behoorlijk gedragen hoeveel schade hij ook berokkent hij zal nooit de verantwoordelijkheid voor zijn daden op zich nemen ik stel wel vast dat zowel in de ethiek als in de sociale wetenschappen het probleem van de vrijbuiter eigenlijk als onoplosbaar wordt beschouwd het is dus zeker niet zo dat alleen de prutsende mens heeft af te rekenen met de vrijbuiter
9155815 wanneer hij de deugd van het durven fouten te maken niet beheerst zal hij steeds minder maatwerk afleveren de werkelijke perfectionist die natuurlijk niet gelooft dat wij prutsers zijn leeft in de illusie dat hij volledige controle heeft over zijn omgeving in de laatste bundel van piet meeuse het lied van de ezelin staat een ingenieus en grappig verhaal de wereld volgens ing schneehammer over een ingenieur die de perfectie nastreeft getallen zijn hiertoe de sleutel zijn leer van de perfectie groeit uit tot een heuse religie die nood heeft aan een gebouw het hoofdkwartier nu de perfectie daadwerkelijk moet gerealiseerd worden faalt schneehammer natuurlijk jammerlijk waardoor zijn wereld ineenstort
9155816 tot faalangst en immobiliteit onze tijd kenmerkt zich door onze drang alles te beheersen zelfs het noodlot de rotterdamse filosoof jos de mul noemt dit de domesticatie van het noodlot vroeger accepteerden we dat het noodlot op een dag aan de kleur klopte als een ongeluk een alles verterende jaloezie ziekte of oorlogsgeweld nu willen we zelfs het noodlot temmen en domesticeren je zou die beheersingsdrang bijna een collectieve neurose kunnen noemen en die is begrijpelijk het appelleert aan de diepe menselijke nood een omgeving te beheersen stel je voor dat een stoel de volgende dag een tafel wordt en de tafel een muur met zoveel variabelen valt niet te leven maar we slaan door we willen alles beheersen zelfs de tijd daar zag ik een paar maanden geleden een prachtig illustratief voorbeeld van het betrof een hardloopwedstrijd een honderd meter sprint er zou een electronisch startschot worden gegeven zo zouden valse starts beter kunnen worden opgemerkt dat klopte ook bij de eerste start bleek een van de lopers drieduizendste van een seconde te vroeg vertrokken opnieuw bij de volgende start vertrok een ander drieduizendste van een seconde te vroeg na vijf valse starts hebben ze het het toestel uitgeschakeld waar praat je over over drieduizendste van een seconde een tijdseenheid die zich onttrekt aan de waarnemingssnelheid van de mens wij denken dat datgene wat meetbaar is ons meer controle biedt dit voorbeeld laat zien dat dit een misvatting is niet datgene wat meetbaar is is bruikbaar maar wat meetbaar is n interpreteerbaar anders blijf je met loze cijfers zitten die ons verlammen of een wedstrijd platleggen
9155817 de deugdethiek biedt daar goede mogelijkheden voor naast de deugdethiek bestaat er ook zoiets als de consequentie ethiek waarbij de gevolgen doorslaggevend zijn voor het handelen maar vaak kunnen we die gevolgen helemaal niet goed inschatten waardoor we ons vergissen niet alleen dat vaak zijn we evenmin in staat om gevolgen te voorzien die te veel denkstappen vragen als ik de mens een prutser noem dan zeg ik daarmee dat de mens een wezen is dat grenzen kent ons gezichtsvermogen is beperkt ons gehoor ons loopvermogen zelfs ons brein kent zijn grenzen een van de sterkste kwaliteiten van de mens is zijn vermogen zijn grenzen te leren kennen maar daarvoor zal je fouten moeten durven maken daar is moed voor nodig wie die moed weet op te brengen zal ontdekken hoe verstandig de houding is omdat je alleen zo van je fouten kunt leren deze houding is ook een mogelijk startpunt voor rechtvaardigheid in mij leeft een diepe behoefte mijn medemens te leren kennen en ik neem ook aan dat mijn medemens mij wil leren kennen dat kan door onze daden en door onze fouten
9155818 niet per se als we beseffen dat we allemaal prutsers zijn zullen we iemand die een fout maakt niet onmiddellijk vervolgen en bestraffen we zullen ons terdege afvragen of de ander die iets vreemds gedaan heeft iets ongewoons iets schadelijks zijn daad had kunnen voorzien en als het onmogelijk is dat hij de gevolgen van zijn daad had kunnen voorzien is het onredelijk hem te straffen en omgekeerd hoop ik ook dat mijn medemens zo naar mij zal kijken als ik een fout maak
9155819 ik zou wel graag ooit een heldendaad willen verrichten maar tot nu toe is dat nog steeds niet gebeurd toch kan ik vrij goed omgaan met het inzicht dat een poging van mij volkomen op niets is uitgelopen zonder daarbij de verzuchting te slaken ik moet mijn pogen maar staken

9155824 the oddity of this convention is that its central figure is the ultimate self made man a dazzling mysterious gatsby the palpable apprehension is that the anointed is a stranger a deeply engaging elegant brilliant stranger with whom the democrats had a torrid affair having slowly woken up they see the ring and wonder who exactly they married last night

9155898 we rushed copies to defcon and sold everything we had in two hours with half of those books claimed before we even unpacked the boxes by the following monday morning we were getting emails from readers telling us how helpful they were finding the book i havent seen anything like this demand in years
9155899 were really seeing a lot of people asking for assistance
9155900 just like with other americans folks are looking for bargains and store brands and theyre buying things that go further maybe you havent eaten rice or spaghetti as much as you do now
9155901 you have a number of folks who come into the military and are making more money than they ever thought they would
9155902 the problem is they dont understand how much it is going to cost they dont think in terms of hard economic times they think in terms of how much money they have
9155903 expenses are never solid they move up and down all the time thats where people get into trouble
9155904 what im seeing is young people coming out of their parents home and they have no kind of background for dealing with finances
9155905 everybody wants everything now im seeing that change more all the time its the instant gratification generation they incur debt quickly because we all know how easy it is to get credit
9155906 when financial problems are introduced into an airmens life their mind might be other places and it can affect the mission
9155907 some clients i see have hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt credit card debt judgments it varies
9155908 you need to put that money to something you could use in the future

9155912 military members are lucky because they have relief societies like ours
9155913 we see people everyday for whom something has happened and they dont have the money to pay for it
9155914 just having the piece of mind of having that money in your account is a good way to live
9155915 the servicemember is 100 percent responsible for paying off the balance of the card
9155916 everything a soldier can possibly need the army is going to do its very best to help them

9155918 theyll be no change to the way were trying to play ive been very happy with the way weve been trying to play
9155919 i think the next two games are within our reach especially with them being at home
9155920 if you get a win and results go our way we could be mid table by saturday night
9155921 brentford were the last team to beat us and that defeat is still fresh in the memory local amp nations
9155922 from playing against them last season we know they like their midfielders to arrive late into the box so we will have to be aware of that
9155923 the main things are to not give away cheap goals and to improve our play in the final third

9155956 this coming 12 months will be the most difficult 12 months the labour party has had in a generation quite frankly weve got to rediscover that zeal which won three elections and that is a huge problem for us at the moment people are pissed off with us
9155957 frankly if you had a reshuffle just now i think the public would say who are they anyway you name me a reshuffle that ever made a difference to a government actually im not expecting one imminently i do not think there will be a reshuffle

9155961 theres nothing you can do about it if a player declares himself unfit you have to accept that we would like to have got him back into the run of things he hasnt had enough football in the last year
9155962 he has trained for 10 days with the first team there is no more we can do we gave him the right platform of training programmes and the right tempo of training everything is done in the manner in which we play on a saturday
9155963 when i told people i wanted to be a priest they were shocked and disbelieving some of them thought i should be committed
9155964 now if a youth says he wants to be a priest there is huge discouragement it is seen as a very silly career move
9155965 i was ordained 22 years ago and when i was in the seminary there were a hundred of us just for the dublin diocese
9155966 a woman in the sacristy at a wedding on saturday looked at me and said are you the parish priest
9155967 and its not going to get any easier morale can be low at times you are just working so hard and theres nobody coming behind you

9155970 its the secularisation of ireland the reduction in family size ireland has just caught up with the more secular europe with its more libertarian values good values around freedom and individuality and personal choice
9155971 it really bolsters you buoys you up to see that
9155972 but theres absolutely no need to be they can see it as a sort of competition theyre afraid that if they give people more power theyre going to lose power
9155973 but it isnt like that its a collaborative effort a sharing of responsibility it takes a lot of weight off the priest
9155974 for us to be able to survive we must share the workload said fr mullan
9155975 its quite threatening to the professional identity of the priest when non ordained people come into work in the parish theyre to be paid more than the clergy and perhaps in time their status will be equal to or greater than the clergy
9155976 its up to us to reorganise things and adapt to the change
9155977 we have to recognise whatever god is saying to us about combining the roles of the clergy and the laity
9155978 we have to learn from the missions system the only answer to all this is with lay involvement the co operation of the people is essential
9155979 humanly speaking you might think its going to get worse and worse
9155980 but its gods church and maybe hes putting us to the test to find other ways of stirring people

9156070 hukumnya orang yang mengaku tahu perkara ghaib bahwa ia kafir karena ia adalah orang yang mendustakan allah azza wa jalla allah taala berfirman
9156071 bagaimana mungkin kalian bisa mengetahui sementara nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam tidak mengetahui perkara ghaib apakah kalian lebih mulia ataukah rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam
9156072 kenapa dihalangi disembunyikan bagi beliau perkara ghaib sedang kalian malah bisa tahu padahal allah azza wa jalla sungguh telah berfirman tentang diri nya
9156073 dia adalah tuhan yang mengetahui yang ghaib maka dia tidak memperlihatkan kepada seorangpun tentang yang ghaib itu kecuali kepada rasul yang diridhai nya maka sesungguhnya dia mengadakan penjaga penjaga malaikat di muka dan di belakangnya
9156074 katakanlah aku tidak mengatakan kepadamu bahwa perbendaharaan allah ada padaku dan tidak pula aku mengetahui yang ghaib dan tidak pula aku mengatakan kepadamu bahwa aku seorang malaikat
9156075 maka mereka mempelajari dari kedua malaikat itu apa yang dengan sihir itu mereka dapat menceraikan antara seorang suami dengan isterinya dan mereka itu ahli sihir tidak memberi mudharat dengan sihirnya kepada seorangpun kecuali dengan izin allah dan mereka mempelajari sesuatu yang tidak memberi mudharat kepadanya dan tidak memberi manfaat sesungguhnya mereka telah meyakini bahwa barangsiapa yang menukarnya kitab allah dengan sihir itu tiadalah baginya keuntungan di akhirat dan amat jahatlah perbuatan mereka menjual dirinya dengan sihir kalau mereka mengetahui

9156078 barang siapa yang mendatangi dukun atau arraf peramal lalu membenarkan apa yang ia katakan maka ia telah kafir terhadap apa yang diturunkan kepada muhammad
9156079 hadits ini dengan hadits yang sebelumnya tak ada kontradiksi karena maksudnya orang yang membenarkan dukun jika ia meyakini bahwa si dukun mengetahui perkara ghaib maka ia kafir jika ia meyakini bahwa jin membisikkan kepada si dukun sesuatu yang ia curi dengar dari malaikat dan bahwa hal itu melalui wangsit dari jin lalu ia orang yang datang ke dukun membenarkan dukun dari cara seperti ini maka ia tak kafir
9156080 seorang yang kafir mau masuk islam apakah ia langsung mengucapkan syahadatain ataukah ia berwudhu lebih dahulu

9156105 we have dramatic landscapes we have the sort of hills that you can walk up not just look at we have wide river valleys rolling hills and the brecon beacons we dont have the noise and the mess of a city the pace of life is something thats very relaxing within the county we dont have a single tesco though we have planning permission for one and we dont have m ands perhaps that helps
9156106 theres a lot of lively debate on what is the most appropriate measure this is the first time in britain at least that theres an attempt to take geography into account
9156107 we found well being is closely linked to staying at your current address living in your home for five years boosts happiness
9156108 it means people are less happy than we would expect them to be maybe miserable is the right word
9156109 he has suffered a huge penalty even before he walks into this courtroom
9156110 clearly demonstrates mr camara opening the canvas bag looking inside pausing very reflectively upon seeing its contents and then putting it in his police cruiser
9156111 what he did he shouldnt have done his judgment had to be impaired
9156112 a police officer committing a theft in the course of his duties must receive a criminal conviction
9156113 it is not in societys interest to refrain from criminalizing such behaviour
9156114 the concept of sexual addiction is a controversial one and thats because it is difficult to define
9156115 there are a lot of people who are critical of the concept because we live in a society that tends to over medicalize and which makes every behavior which deviates from the norm an addiction or a disorder
9156116 the internet has provided a level of access to pornography that was previously unavailable so many people have this problem and the internet has driven that
9156117 there is no question the character played by duchovny is sexually compulsive it has destroyed his marriage and the show shows some of the ramifications of the characters sexual behavior upon his daughter which is actually quite realistic
9156118 if you wait until you see the whites of their eyes you will never know what hit you
9156119 i have no statistical analysis but it does seem like they come in waves
9156120 like every spring there are paving scams or charitable solicitation a group may immerse themselves in an area saturate it then move on to another area
9156121 we got a report of suspicious activity three people carrying backpacks
9156122 officer wayne young located her and she said she was selling door to door i arrived and we told her she had no hawkers and peddlers license from the state or the town when officer young asked for her backpack she immediately said she said marijuana in her backpack
9156123 they also had no permits so we brought them to the police station to wait for their ride
9156124 one thing about charitable solicitations people should know is that they have to be registered with our charitable trust unit and there are new hampshire laws regulating how they operate
9156125 once a year they must file a report they are not allowed to engage in unfair practices get as much information about the charity as you can know how much money is used for charity and how much for administrative overhead be suspicious of everyone
9156126 once they have the money and disappear into the night its very hard to get that money back
9156127 thats not the way boston childrens hospital would do a fund raiser
9156128 i gave them a check but when i read the newspaper article i called the bank and canceled it
9156129 of course it cost me 28 at the bank to stop a 49 check they wanted me to buy a book to send to the children in the hospital the guy said he was raising money to go to australia as he was a unh marine biology student
9156130 a portsmouth resident received a call for a chimney cleaning service called up and smoke chimney industries offering a cleaning and inspection for 39 99 when they were there the bill was over 1 500 and she paid them
9156131 if you get a phone call soliciting anything ask them for a number you can call them back at
9156132 ask them to send information in the mail dont give payment up front dont give your credit card over the phone unless you personally know the person and know the business is legitimate reputable people will give you their license and references
9156133 were getting all types of scams into the office that sound so believable callers are giving toll free numbers to verify the offers we tried calling one but we needed a pin to complete the connection
9156134 if it doesnt pass the smell test if sounds too good to be true it generally is
9156135 mccain declared as the pair stood together for the first time at a boisterous rally in ohio just days before the opening of the partys national convention
9156136 im going to take our campaign to every part of our country and our message of reform to every voter of every background in every political party or no party at all
9156137 politics isnt just a game of competing interests and clashing parties
9156138 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9156139 governor palin is a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government
9156140 by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done senator mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington
9156141 we should all be proud of gov sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and sen mccain while their policies would take america in the wrong direction gov palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9156142 he sees sarah governor palin as the future of the party
9156143 these are people hed like to elevate in that regard reformers
9156144 id like to know more about her experience if something happened to him would she be qualified to step into the presidency
9156145 go to the sea ketch and have a blue moon with an orange in it
9156146 the last couple of weeks weve had some good weather so weve been catching up
9156147 the only things were still behind on is paving but well get most of it done before snow flies
9156148 i think its the most powerful thing i have ever experienced
9156149 for the iraqis life among the americans often meant living a double life the one they thought the americans wanted to see and the real one they lived when the americans went home
9156150 the audacity of deceit barack obamas war on american values
9156151 legal representation for the poor has been an issue for a very long time but over the past decade the need for additional support for the poor and working poor has become more acute
9156152 in family court for example something like 75 percent of all cases involve at least one party who does not have an attorney often times these cases have fundamental rights such as custody of children at issue
9156153 well certainly approach the game the same we way we have done the last two or three
9156154 theyll be no change to the way were trying to play ive been very happy with the way weve been trying to play
9156155 brentford were the last team to beat us and that defeat is still fresh in the memory local amp nations
9156156 i think the next two games are within our reach especially with them being at home
9156157 if you get a win and results go our way we could be mid table by saturday night
9156158 50 41 53 53 57 4f 52 44 3d 31 30 38 3b

9156160 henris brain injury has severely affected his ability to filter and process information his ability to take self protective measures his ability to exercise judgment and his short term memory ability
9156161 the accident left henri with major difficulties which are likely to persist for several years if not permanently
9156162 traumatic experience which quite expectedly has short circuited his ability to deal with various emotions
9156163 i think shes a terrific selection and completely outside of the box
9156164 and for someone whos interested in public policy like me shes the perfect pick
9156165 i think it was a good move on johns part because he likes to look at things differently and approach things differently and not fall into the same old mold
9156166 the reason why john mccain has always done so well here is because he has the same core values and beliefs that we do as a state
9156167 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9156168 governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies
9156169 my concern is that the national election has become american idolized in that people are voting on image instead of substance
9156170 palin was not the best choice but she also does have substance for the conservative person
9156171 it makes a lot of sense for his core constituency that he wants to galvanize particularly evangelical women
9156172 theres definitely interest on the part of some workers in relocating but we dont know how many yet
9156173 we are a large employer here and have the support of the governor and state officials
9156174 this was a very difficult but necessary decision for prime as we work to streamline our domestic operations and improve profitability
9156175 like many manufacturing businesses in the u s we have been adversely and negatively affected by unprecedented increases in the cost of energy and chemicals and the general economic slowdown
9156176 these unforeseen developments have hastened our need to eliminate excess costs and overhead and our success as a company depends upon our ability to act decisively to achieve that result
9156177 we continue to believe the very best way to serve our loyal customers is as a stable profitable and consistent supplier and this reorganization will ensure that we continue to meet that objective
9156178 what do you do if your productivity drops to two lines of code a day and you just sit and stare at the code and feel like you dont know how to do it anymore
9156179 whenever i dont feel like programming on something ive had other projects or ive just done something else altogether like reading i think it turns into programmers block only when you feel you have to do something specific and ive been able to avoid that
9156180 why we let people get away with silly things like writers block programmers block i dont know if you called the plumber and he told you he couldnt fix your leaky pipes because he had plumbers block would you be understanding the only cure for programmers block is start programming something anything just as the only cure for writers block is to start writing
9156181 the only way to cure programmers block is a direct infusion of skittles and mountain dew intravenously keeping the brain in an alert and creative state
9156182 i like to make an analogy to meditation as being like defragging the hard drive flushing memory cache and throwing out temporary files
9156183 if i get blocked i usually go do something of an artistic nature like using painter coreldraw or photopaint sometimes even work in 3d studio max or even adobe after effects frequently the problem i was having gets resolved while i am immersed in less stressful things
9156184 i dont call it programmers block i think of it as stagnation
9156185 there are sometimes whole weeks where i dont really write any code although i think i am in the end nothing useful comes out of it my mind is still processing stuff while im idling im learning what its like to use the thing i did in my last burst of productivity
9156186 the real frustrating thing with modern day programming where you try to assemble a bunch of components which should fit together is making the tools work together as gracefully as possible
9156187 say you have a rough outline for assembling a web front end or a visual basic front end with java glue to a database back end two to three to four things that combine together its bad now and going to get worse
9156188 ant build pleasegod dtest john3 16 to have the initial project actually work then it sucks
9156189 turn out to be winners although hes no bargain because he was already considered the best in the world
9156190 chances are good that if hed done only slightly worse they might not really be getting their moneys worth because im sure they were cutting deals based on his potential
9156191 public figures like michael phelps exert a major influence over our youngsters
9156192 ciof believes that celebrities should think twice before choosing to endorse or encourage the consumption of any product which is inherently unhealthful sic to children especially if that product is correlated to obesity diabetes and a myriad of dangerous conditions
9156193 michael embodies the values behind our frosted flakes earn your stripes programme
9156194 as an official sponsor of the 2008 us olympic team and a proud sponsor of phelps it is only fitting that kellogg company feature this world class athlete on its iconic boxes of kelloggs corn flakes and kelloggs frosted flakes cereals
9156195 ive put more aside than i thought but i just dont know how to decide how much is enough
9156196 what i do know is that i would like to have the same annual after tax income in retirement as i have now
9156197 her goal is to retire in two years but she would also like to know the financial implications of working to age 65
9156198 she has no employment pension nor any liabilities she is not wealthy but she can generate additional retirement income
9156199 but she would gain a great deal by working to age 65 three more years of work is not a large sacrifice to make for several decades of comfortable living
9156200 youll get a reluctant glimpse into that dark place in my psyche that just cant get enough of peugeots
9156201 if i truly like all of the crap ive been foisting upon you is there
9156202 if this were a 1973 monte carlo which its not instead of the 1992 volvo wagon that we have i would right now be looking at a dashboard rendered entirely in matte black
9156203 there is so much history but also its kind of small for how big it was you could go anywhere
9156204 even if you take it for seven or eight years when you get to germany you realize its a lot more complicated than you thought
9156205 ive lived with my family my whole life living with another family is completely different
9156206 it was interesting to see how they work with each other
9156207 we send out very good students that really present a positive face on america and dispel a lot of the stereotypes we have
9156208 wahai orang orang yang beriman telah wajib ke atas kamu berpuasa sebagaimana telah diwajibkan ke atas umat umat yang sebelum kamu semuga kamu menjadi orang yang bertakwa
9156209 ya allah tolong abaikan puasa umat muhammad s aw apabila sebelum memasuki bulan ramadhan al mubarak dia tidak melakukan hal hak yang berikut
9156210 apples play for the living room on the future of apple tv and the itunes movie download service
9156211 i didnt want to be a practice squad guy i didnt want to just limit myself to a special teams guy i wanted to beat plax plaxico burress out for his job
9156212 it may sound silly but mom says reach for the stars if you dont make it you land on the moon hopefully it all paid off
9156213 i just didnt think it was fair to the other guys
9156214 im 100 percent and ill be on the practice field on sunday preparing to beat the redskins
9156215 im a purist of the game but with the pressures of other sports having replay and the outcry from the public in favor of it theyre the ones that are paying the ticket prices and buying the souvenirs that keeps baseball going
9156216 but its a slippery slope and when you go down that slope its hard to stop it
9156217 if we feel or if the organization feels that theres enough talent then i dont have a problem with that
9156218 he can take the jersey down form the rafters and put it on his back
9156219 ewing jr will have an opportunity here to compete for a spot on our roster
9156220 he is a solid defensive player and a very good athlete
9156221 i think he could be a good addition to an nba team because hes a glue guy
9156222 coming to the knicks and hopefully being able to contribute means a lot to me it has always been my dream to play for this team
9156223 my goal is to show the coaches that i can play and do all that i can to help the team win some games
9156224 in this game its about opportunities every chance you get youve got to try to take advantage of it and i had 35 chances and i tried my best to take advantage
9156225 i didnt realize i had that many yards until coach told me after the game
9156226 that felt good for all the work put in during the offseason
9156227 just that aroma walking out on the field on sundays is a feeling you cant really describe
9156228 im going to give rodriguez a better way to come
9156229 when he first hit it i thought it was gone
9156230 that was a very very big play for us by murphy a very big play
9156231 that will probably go unnoticed but that might have been the thing that saved us
9156232 i was just thinking i needed to come through right there with a hit and at least tie the ballgame as soon as i saw it i hit it and knew it was gone
9156233 theyre a young fastball hitting team and im a young fastball pitcher
9156234 it hasnt been a good matchup for me for whatever reason i just need to get the ball down in the strike zone against them ive left balls up against them and theyve made me pay for it
9156235 i feel that he actually tries too hard against these guys
9156236 its certainly not his physical stuff i see his ball creep up against these guys when hes throwing down against other people
9156237 as far as the organization is concerned theyre going to do whatever they need to do for the future if im part of the equation so be it if not its just a business decision they make
9156238 after coming back and finally playing in the system ive known for years not being able to compete in camp and have an opportunity to fight for a starting job has been very frustrating
9156239 any time you win a super bowl if youre part of that team you did something right
9156240 but i dont think theres anything in the bank that carries over its the last year of my contract this is my 11th season for me its about making the team just staying ready
9156241 i know i know but ive always wanted to see what it was like to drive on the other side of the road and i didnt expect that to happen
9156242 its so hot here i mean i know were in africa in the summer in the desert but i didnt expect it to be this hot
9156243 its so cold here and no i dont want to wear that mission trip coat
9156244 we got the first goal right off then we got a little rusty
9156245 then we started talking again and started controlling the ball again
9156246 were a young team regardless of their age weve got a bunch of juniors but weve got a young team
9156247 there are a lot of kids who havent seen a lot of varsity time at all
9156248 we wanted to get the season started really fast to score early helped us so much it gave us a lot more confidence
9156249 i guess i saw an opportunity the kid took a big touch i snuck up from behind him and got the ball
9156250 i just tried it a lot in practice and try to go coast to coast and my cross was at the right place at the right time and seth had a great finish
9156251 we worked in practice in changing the field it was just beautiful
9156252 i think well be able to piece together more of an offense this year and i think were able to do that yeah we scored four goals but we increased our chances and that was good to see
9156253 it was almost the exact game we played against them here last year
9156254 kelsey got a goal right around the same time of the game last year the only difference was that we were able to get one very early in overtime but well definitely take the tie tonight
9156255 shes able to get those bouncing balls and always find a way to drill them in the back of the net
9156256 but on the other hand they hit the post a couple times too so to come out of portsmouth with a tie well be more than happy to take it
9156257 you like it when two teams get together like this
9156258 you have two nearby rivals playing a good clean game against each other its great for the kids its great for the game
9156259 ill tell you what we wouldnt have minded a little warm up first
9156260 portsmouth and oyster river right out of the gate is pretty tough on one hand well get to see where we are right off the bat but yeah a couple warm ups would be nice
9156261 what are the elements affected by changes in this version
9156262 to come in here and do my job is all i wanted to do and its better later than never i guess
9156263 you look at what can he do for us in the next month hes 2 0 thats a pretty good start
9156264 but as far as the team goes we have a lot of hard work ahead of us
9156265 its just easier for me to turn the page than wonder what could have been
9156266 when you talk about mo its amazing what he does on a daily basis on a yearly basis
9156267 i didnt even know he was there i just had to refocus again
9156268 we have to win games this is the way we have to do it
9156269 im fine as long as we win its ok we just have to play and win we cant think about somebody else
9156270 i just think that when mike pelfrey is pitching the way he has pitched he can beat anybody
9156271 from where we are now we can ill afford to be mixing and matching we have to go with our best foot forward and hes one of the best we got right now
9156272 teach both you know dont be afraid of information healthy debate is so important and its so valuable in our schools i am a proponent of teaching both
9156273 i dont have any doubts in my mind that its the right decision
9156274 may there be some kinks in it early on possibly but to me its the right decision and i am actually all in favor of it
9156275 i have yet to receive a memo on exactly how it works
9156276 we couldnt bring him back as a starter if we activated him right away because hes not built like that
9156277 i feel fine theres nothing holding me back as far as strength wise
9156278 itll be one more test saturday throwing to hitters and i think that hopefully will be the last one before i get in a game
9156279 other than those 4 300 seats which are going to subsidize everybody else the prices are not
9156280 and remember 24 000 plus seats will have no price increase at all
9156281 legati e imbavagliati mentre cenavano violenza selvaggia e gratuita per pochi spiccioli
9156282 we have to keep playing hard every game counts right now
9156283 the mentality right now is that we cant take anything for granted
9156284 it doesnt matter how far behind we are in the game if we put our effort in we can come back and thats what we did
9156285 that was a big win for us because we appeared lethargic
9156286 we didnt appear to be in a fighting mood offensively i think we should have been a little better
9156287 it looked as if there was a rock or something in the path that made the bicycle break in two
9156288 warning i cant stop playing i bet you cant stop either
9156289 this is not a game of who the free online flash games for gamers
9156290 reflecting on the past doesnt do me any good or the team
9156291 to tell you the truth its just as easy for me to turn the page what it could have been doesnt really matter
9156292 i never look at the past i look at what can he do for us over the next six weeks hes 2 0 for us thats a pretty good start
9156293 i asked for six innings and i got everything i asked for
9156294 we had the bullpen how we wanted it and he did his job
9156295 i walked off the mound thinking that was a big out i was pretty locked in
9156296 the 12 hour fasting is to overcome and ease conflict and suffering in the world and particularly for freedom and justice of the people of tibet and china
9156297 have given assurances that there is absolutely no cause for concern all that he needs is a good rest
9156298 but blake what about all that stuff about post apocalyptic movies you rant on about arent you demanding realism from a narrative there
9156299 mccain declared as the pair stood together for the first time at a boisterous rally in ohio just days before the opening of the partys national convention

9156313 we got a report of suspicious activity three people carrying backpacks
9156314 officer wayne young located her and she said she was selling door to door i arrived and we told her she had no hawkers and peddlers license from the state or the town when officer young asked for her backpack she immediately said she said marijuana in her backpack
9156315 they also had no permits so we brought them to the police station to wait for their ride
9156316 one thing about charitable solicitations people should know is that they have to be registered with our charitable trust unit and there are new hampshire laws regulating how they operate
9156317 once a year they must file a report they are not allowed to engage in unfair practices get as much information about the charity as you can know how much money is used for charity and how much for administrative overhead be suspicious of everyone

9156319 thats not the way boston childrens hospital would do a fund raiser
9156320 i gave them a check but when i read the newspaper article i called the bank and canceled it
9156321 of course it cost me 28 at the bank to stop a 49 check they wanted me to buy a book to send to the children in the hospital the guy said he was raising money to go to australia as he was a unh marine biology student
9156322 a portsmouth resident received a call for a chimney cleaning service called up and smoke chimney industries offering a cleaning and inspection for 39 99 when they were there the bill was over 1 500 and she paid them
9156323 if you get a phone call soliciting anything ask them for a number you can call them back at
9156324 ask them to send information in the mail dont give payment up front dont give your credit card over the phone unless you personally know the person and know the business is legitimate reputable people will give you their license and references
9156325 were getting all types of scams into the office that sound so believable callers are giving toll free numbers to verify the offers we tried calling one but we needed a pin to complete the connection

9156327 most ovarian cancer patients develop recurrent disease that eventually becomes resistant to standard chemotherapy which is associated with apoptosis
9156328 if ginger can cause autophagic cell death in addition to apoptosis it may circumvent resistance to conventional chemotherapy
9156329 this study doesnt mean that people should dash down to the supermarket and stockpile ginger
9156330 chris coleman mentioned him wood and i said forget it hes not for sale said laws
9156331 i dont know where it has come from he is still not for sale
9156332 theres definitely interest on the part of some workers in relocating but we dont know how many yet

9156349 legal representation for the poor has been an issue for a very long time but over the past decade the need for additional support for the poor and working poor has become more acute
9156350 in family court for example something like 75 percent of all cases involve at least one party who does not have an attorney often times these cases have fundamental rights such as custody of children at issue
9156351 i think shes a terrific selection and completely outside of the box
9156352 and for someone whos interested in public policy like me shes the perfect pick
9156353 i think it was a good move on johns part because he likes to look at things differently and approach things differently and not fall into the same old mold
9156354 the reason why john mccain has always done so well here is because he has the same core values and beliefs that we do as a state
9156355 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9156356 governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies
9156357 my concern is that the national election has become american idolized in that people are voting on image instead of substance
9156358 palin was not the best choice but she also does have substance for the conservative person
9156359 it makes a lot of sense for his core constituency that he wants to galvanize particularly evangelical women
9156360 henris brain injury has severely affected his ability to filter and process information his ability to take self protective measures his ability to exercise judgment and his short term memory ability
9156361 the accident left henri with major difficulties which are likely to persist for several years if not permanently
9156362 traumatic experience which quite expectedly has short circuited his ability to deal with various emotions
9156363 it was almost the exact game we played against them here last year
9156364 kelsey got a goal right around the same time of the game last year the only difference was that we were able to get one very early in overtime but well definitely take the tie tonight
9156365 shes able to get those bouncing balls and always find a way to drill them in the back of the net
9156366 but on the other hand they hit the post a couple times too so to come out of portsmouth with a tie well be more than happy to take it
9156367 you like it when two teams get together like this
9156368 you have two nearby rivals playing a good clean game against each other its great for the kids its great for the game
9156369 ill tell you what we wouldnt have minded a little warm up first
9156370 portsmouth and oyster river right out of the gate is pretty tough on one hand well get to see where we are right off the bat but yeah a couple warm ups would be nice
9156371 concentrate on the sick and elderly and the young people and youll get to meet and know the congregation
9156372 we got the first goal right off then we got a little rusty
9156373 then we started talking again and started controlling the ball again
9156374 were a young team regardless of their age weve got a bunch of juniors but weve got a young team
9156375 there are a lot of kids who havent seen a lot of varsity time at all
9156376 we wanted to get the season started really fast to score early helped us so much it gave us a lot more confidence
9156377 i guess i saw an opportunity the kid took a big touch i snuck up from behind him and got the ball
9156378 i just tried it a lot in practice and try to go coast to coast and my cross was at the right place at the right time and seth had a great finish
9156379 we worked in practice in changing the field it was just beautiful
9156380 i think well be able to piece together more of an offense this year and i think were able to do that yeah we scored four goals but we increased our chances and that was good to see
9156381 weve been in this building for more than 15 years
9156382 the landlord has been great to us but we have grown thats not necessarily a good thing but its fact we would like a place where we are more inviting and have quiet spaces to offer our clients
9156383 lots of people think they dont have the ability to engineer change
9156384 they can they can become empowered by just using compostable cups and so on all the little things really add up
9156385 it is shameful that milf has chosen to look the other way when its members committed unspeakable atrocities
9156386 the attacks on military and police outposts and even innocent civilians albeit on a smaller scale have been going on even before
9156387 you managed to stay sober despite the tremendous pressure from some sectors crying for blood
9156388 i would press the government not to continue the fighting even especially at the ramadan time
9156389 the omani ship held for six months was released last night
9156390 i think a ransom was paid but i do not know the exact amount
9156391 for the safety of the crew we cannot disclose too much but we call on the un and the international community to take urgent steps and stop the worsening security situation in these waters
9156392 we are very concerned with the current situation we have been warning seafarers plying these waters on a regular basis as attacks are escalating
9156393 filipino crew by their contract should not be allowed to be on ships vulnerable to pirates and raiders
9156394 restricted by contract to the safe sea lanes identified and certified by the coalition of naval forces operating in the area
9156395 its time for us to propose ways that the sea based workers not go to dangerous areas
9156396 while equity investors are willing to look out toward better times the bond market has concluded that loans will cost more and that fixed income securities held as collateral at many financial institutions are worth less
9156397 we are inclined to believe that the fixed income market may be a little more prescient in this case and that the stock market is going to continue to bounce along at relatively low levels for a while
9156398 the comparisons of year on year earnings are getting easier because the third quarter of 2007 was a disaster and youd think firms would be able to beat them but theyre not going to
9156399 if you look at gdp youre led to believe the economy is solid
9156400 but if you look at the variables employment industrial production and personal income the economy does not look solid but weak
9156401 but i think were in the process of bottoming investors are trying to look beyond the valley of myriad problems to better times ahead
9156402 too many people think its a v shaped situation where you hit rock bottom and then everything is suddenly great
9156403 i think there are more hurdles to come the bottoming process takes time
9156404 think of the kids i cant believe youre sending me down for this for a 10 wrap
9156405 my client has been a drug addict for 20 years and has a long standing problem which has led to him committing a vast quantity of crime
9156406 the most serious was conspiracy to supply heroin this was a wide scale drugs operation led by brian bimbo oneil
9156407 mr dalzell was a street dealer and would go out and sell and get a wrap free for himself this is the first time my client has been back in court for a while hes been offence free for about eight or nine months
9156408 he received no help inside for his addiction and now he is on a methadone programme
9156409 on the day he was caught hed been sick and thought the methadone wouldnt work so he decided to buy some heroin until he could get his methadone the following day
9156410 he has a long standing partner and three children who he separated from after his last time in custody

9156416 chess goes the entire range when i go to tournaments you can pretty much guarantee that there will be at least one 10 year old but at 60 i am nowhere near the oldest either
9156417 chess really keeps your mind active and there is all kinds of evidence that if you play chess you wont come down with alzheimers so really its the worlds greatest hobby for everybody because its both cheap and it keeps you sharp
9156418 you cant really understand until you have competed the intensity of this tournament
9156419 there is just something about playing competitive chess that is quite intense and there is just so much adrenaline because if you slip once you know you are going to waste four hours of your time so everyone here generally does there best to stay on the top of their game

9156439 if flip flopping is a sin im a sinner as you know i once said i dont see how i could ever come to support john mccain
9156440 i never thought mccain could do anything that could get this cynical old conservative to care about his election sarah palin is unbelievably good i first met her years ago as a solid limited government socially conservative activist and she hasnt changed a bit since
9156441 after the great success of the democratic convention the choice of sarah palin is surely a hail mary pass
9156442 otegi got out at 7 25 am 0525 gmt and there are lots of people outside
9156443 unfortunately there is a basic political problem in this basque country
9156444 personally i believe that this problem will only be resolved through dialogue and negotiation
9156445 through dialogue and negotiation this country will know peace and democracy that will allow it to take a decision on its future and lead to the release of all

9156455 its a continuation of the theme of the lost american tour when most of the reviews where phrased very funny it was called something like
9156456 it was almost the exact game we played against them here last year
9156457 kelsey got a goal right around the same time of the game last year the only difference was that we were able to get one very early in overtime but well definitely take the tie tonight

9156467 im stunned this choice suggests mccain thinks he has an uphill climb to win this election
9156468 on his 72nd birthday is this really the one heartbeat away he wants to put in the white house
9156469 it is almost impossible to exaggerate how important that is to the conservative faith community
9156470 this is a choice that allows mccain to keep the base happy but it also allows him to reinforce his image as a maverick
9156471 you could see by the way second baseman jeff kent reacted that it was off to the right it looked like he just lost his grip
9156472 maybe with the on base percentage of russell it will give them a little different look at the plate
9156473 matty has just been anxious and its not a punishment to hit him fifth
9156474 you never know but right now relieving is my job and ill do whatever it takes to give this team a chance to win
9156475 because once he thinks girls are cute hell change his ways and his underwear
9156476 quite a few guys have come through the academy and are thankful for chances that are maybe not given elsewhere
9156477 others like hugh gustafson and martyn thomas have come to us from welsh regions its then up to us youngsters to seize the chance and keep the place
9156478 its been great playing 15 plus games a season with the dragons
9156479 last season i was facing the likes of perpignan and london irish in the heineken cup
9156480 thats what you want to be doing playing on the best stages its fantastic for future development
9156481 that will only develop welsh rugby as a whole the main aim of everyone here
9156482 weve made quite a few new signings and we hope theyll have a positive effect
9156483 were always called underdogs and that boosts the team mentality were a very close group on and off the pitch
9156484 but we dont feel that the underdog tag is totally deserved we think we can prove a few people wrong this year
9156485 like everyone well be targeting the quarter finals of the heineken cup and seeing where we can go from there and we want to improve on last seasons eighth spot in the magners league

9156564 nosotros hemos repudiado tremendamente este acto y vamos a aplicar con rigor la ley pero tambi n con la sensatez de no prejuzgar de no partir haciendo cosas locas por manos individuales sino que respetando la institucionalidad que este pa s tiene
9156565 se est trabajando con la canciller a se ha estado trabajando en una especie de acuerdo con el gobierno paname o
9156566 llamamos al gobierno a promulgar y depositar el convenio 169 de la oit sobre pueblos ind genas el que fuera aprobado por el congreso en marzo pasado y permanece inexplicablemente en el escritorio de la presidenta esperando su firma ello a pesar de que el ejecutivo conoce los procedimientos que este convenio establece para la resoluci n de conflictos por tierras como los que afectan a la comunidad de temucuicui
9156567 intercambio de informaci n para una mayor operatividad en la regi n de la araucan a fue el objetivo de la reuni n de seguridad que convoc el ministerio del interior y que tuvo la participaci n de la polic a civil carabineros la agencia nacional de inteligencia y un representante del fiscal nacional sabas chahu n quien no estuvo presente
9156568 en la octava y novena regi n son 1 500 comunidades mapuches
9156569 hay que mirarlo en su justa medida hay que darle la oportunidad a las polic as que trabajen tranquilas porque esta es una investigaci n de largo aliento no son investigaciones de un d a para otro para tener un resultado hay que tener paciencia
9156570 estamos tratando de obtener la mayor informaci n y yo he reforzado la cantidad de funcionarios para ver si podemos detener a las personas que corresponden de acuerdo a las instrucciones de los fiscales
9156571 frankly if you had a reshuffle just now i think the public would say who are they anyway you name me a reshuffle that ever made a difference to a government actually
9156572 and you cant be chopping and changing people that often i mean undoubtedly at some stage before the end of the parliament he will want to do a reshuffle but im not expecting one imminently i do not think there will be a reshuffle
9156573 i believe that anyone can speak of the spirit and the ethos of a united world college but the true challenge arises when one must step outside the open minded and culturally accepting community of a united world college to the wider world which unfortunately is not as accepting and still remain firm in the belief of the idea and possibility of unity in diversity
9156574 for years i chose not to engage in party politics at this time however changing that posture feels like the responsible thing to do
9156575 p rez yoma rechaz duramente el ultim tum de agricultores de la araucan a

9156577 la escuela en un alto grado es una fuente de cultivo para el racismo la discriminaci n la negaci n de todo lo mapuche
9156578 los derechos educativos y ling sticos son parte importante de los derechos colectivos de nuestro pueblo naci n mapuche reconocidos por la legislaci n internacional en varios instrumentos convenio 169 oit convenci n de los derechos del ni o declaraci n de diversidad cultural unesco declaraci n de la onu derechos pueblos ind genas y que en el proyecto lge del gobierno no son expresados reflejando una vez mas la sistem tica pol tica de violaci n a nuestros derechos pol ticos como pueblo naci n mapuche por parte de la institucionalidad racista del estado chileno
9156579 disminuye la cantidad de hablantes y se interrumpe el aprendizaje por las nuevas ge ne ra ciones

9156581 la agitaci n para el uso de la violencia institucional de parte del senador alberto espina
9156582 en todo momento los carabineros preguntaban por armamento y el paradero de los pe i que est n requeridos por la justicia nuestros luchadores sociales mapuche se nos interroga por armas que jam s han encontrado ni jam s encontrar n porque no existen
9156583 asombra la facilidad con que se estigmatiza a todo el pueblo mapuche
9156584 me asombra la facilidad con la cual a partir de estos hechos se estigmatiza al pueblo mapuche como un todo cuando quienes vivimos en la regi n de la araucan a y conocemos al campesino de esta etnia sabemos que se trata de personas emprendedoras cuya principal preocupaci n radica en sacar adelante a sus familias y en poder trabajar para conseguirlo tal como cualquier chileno
9156585 conozco al pueblo mapuche he visto como se desconocen sus derechos ancestrales he compartido con l desde mi primera infancia he alojado en sus comunidades y s que son los chilenos a los cuales la sociedad otorga menos oportunidades y de los cuales m s se abusa esto llega al punto de que cuando el estado les asigna recursos como ocurre con el programa or genes hay una corte de intermediarios y consultoras de partidos pol ticos que tienen como conducta permanente aprovechar en propio beneficio los dineros que se destinan al pueblo mapuche
9156586 mientras hay subsidio para plantar rboles en los campos de la araucan a y as desplazar a las ciudades al mapuche no hay subsidio para que estos campesinos puedan siquiera mantener una agricultura de subsistencia ello es inducido por las pol ticas de gobierno para expulsar al mapuche de sus tierras y fr amente desruralizar la araucan a
9156587 la injusta estigmatizaci n que cierta prensa hace del pueblo mapuche el aprovechamiento de ciertos pol ticos de los recursos que la ley destina al pueblo mapuche y la desruralizaci n impulsada desde el estado forman parte del clima contrario a la generaci n de paz social que nuestra araucan a necesita para dejar de ser la m s pobre del pa s y ser la regi n perdedora de la cual hablan los organismos internacionales
9156588 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
9156589 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
9156590 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas
9156591 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
9156592 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
9156593 es un conflicto que el estado le ha instalado a la comunidad paichil antriao
9156594 el estado ha ido de alg n modo violentando permanentemente el derecho a la consulta y participaci n de la comunidad
9156595 el conflicto no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas
9156596 el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas
9156597 la m s importante que haya habido en el pa s por cierto la m s sangrienta
9156598 de modo incomprensible el gobierno se demor m s de 90 d as en dar respuesta a la huelga de hambre de patricia troncoso que la prensa tambi n acall
9156599 no fue porque exista una conspiraci n del silencio lo que hay es una autorrepresi n psicol gica en la sociedad chilena frente al conflicto con el pueblo mapuche creemos que si no lo vemos desaparece
9156600 neruda sol a viajar desde temuco a puerto saavedra pues all un colono de apellido winter le prestaba libros en ese tiempo el poeta escribi sus primeras obras los borradores de los veinte poemas de amor pero en todos ellos no hay un solo indio neruda no los vio y eso que en puerto saavedra no hay m s que arena olas y mapuches
9156601 sacar el conflicto mapuche del mbito policial y reconocerle su condici n de problema pol tico
9156602 la clave del problema es que nos hemos negado a reconocerles su condici n de pueblo aceptaremos ahora que en el estado de chile puede coexistir m s de un pueblo
9156603 esta es una vieja historia cargada de decepci n y frustraciones

9156607 nosotros reconocemos en los mapuches a nuestros ancestros pero andar pregonando que uno ha matado al padre es feo

9156609 este es un fen meno com n a am rica latina
9156610 el primer gran desaf o que enfrent la conadi fue pronunciarse respecto del proyecto de construcci n de la central hidroel ctrica ralco que requer a aprobar la permuta de terrenos ind genas como los delegados del presidente en dicha organizaci n votaron en contra frei los cambi as la conadi perdi su legitimidad cuando se estrenaba en sociedad
9156611 el informe qued archivado en alg n escritorio en la moneda de donde no volvi a salir
9156612 no les parec a que los delitos calificaran de terrorismo pero el gobierno insisti ante la corte suprema contratando los servicios de un prominente abogado amigo y profesor de los jueces que deb an resolver
9156613 y el tema desapareci de la agenda de gobierno esta administraci n nunca tuvo realmente una pol tica para enfrentar el conflicto mapuche
9156614 estamos dispuestos a aceptar al mapuche folcl rico aquel que baila con sus trajes t picos y es amable pero no al joven que se viste con chaqueta de cuero y que se nos para de igual a igual exigiendo respeto a sus derechos
9156615 pero se equivocaron quienes creyeron que este asistencialismo iba a desindigenizar a los j venes mapuches al contrario el acceso al conocimiento y a los derechos que hoy se les reconocen internacionalmente a los pueblos ind genas han alentado sus demandas
9156616 el gobierno se enfrenta hoy a una intifada mapuche y ya se dio cuenta de que el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas pero es dif cil saber hasta d nde se va a llegar el problema de fondo sigue siendo el reconocimiento pol tico la existencia de un pueblo y el derecho a la tierra porque como ha demostrado el conflicto palestino israel no hay cultura sin territorio
9156617 all en per hay un mejor clima laboral y un mejor control contra la violencia le est haciendo muy mal a chile esta idea de que a trav s de la violencia y de la ilegalidad los grupos de presi n pueden satisfacer sus demandas
9156618 ya quisiera alg n partido u ong tener tanta influencia
9156619 los pueblos ind genas no se oponen al desarrollo sino que quieren ser incluidos en sus propios t rminos y esto no comprende el gobierno

9156765 and barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation because we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them

9156772 so tonight in honor of my fathers memory and my daughters future out of gratitude to those whose triumphs we mark this week and those whose everyday sacrifices have brought us to this moment let us devote ourselves to finishing their work let us work together to fulfill their hopes and let us stand together to elect barack obama president of the united states of america

9157131 does not factor in the possible transfer of responsibilities that may take place in the coming years between the french state fp
9157132 any deviance from the current strategy of fiscal consolidation and structural adjustments could put the rating under pressure any slippage in borrowing needs beyond our expectations could also pressure the rating
9157133 this risk could materialize if current economic conditions worsen further and result in more operating margin reduction or if fp enters a new phase of political instability
9157134 after capital expenditures below approximately 7 percent of total revenues
9157135 growing rigidity in operating costs weakened management capacities and significant off balance sheet exposure
9157136 recent history of chronic political instability does not suggest that the current government will last
9157137 the long term prospect of a smooth decrease in financial transfers from the state is putting fps economic model into question while global economic trends are weakening its economic situation
9157138 this rating action hinges on reinforced institutional political and financial support from the french government to the polynesian government in its endeavor to rationalize public institutions to curb public spending and to engage in structural reforms
9157139 continuous deterioration in the operating margin to an estimated 7 percent of operation revenues in 2008 from 18 percent in 2005
9157140 allocated to operating revenues and more importantly increasingly flat tax revenues
9157141 growing investment to boost the economy should amplify fps recourse to debt in the coming years borrowings should however remain moderate thanks to sizable state investment subsidies and a significant cumulated surplus
9157142 direct debt represented 60 percent of operating revenues at year end 2007 or 13 percent of gdp standard amp poors estimates consolidated debt to represent about 18 of gdp massive and continued state transfers that together with fps spending account for about two thirds of gdp account for french polynesias high standard of living for the region
9157143 is handicapped by its very small size an young and growing population
9157144 after a flat year in 2006 real gdp growth caught up somewhat in 2007 but remained insufficient to stabilize unemployment

9157149 world heritage area would not be sustainable in the long term in png and would likely fail it would be unmanageable and landowners would not accept quarantining of their land without a sustained compensation package a failed wha will leave png with a major problem as the country will not be able to rescind the declaration and will lose prestige
9157150 as you know we thought deeply about the expropriation bill and we after serious considerations felt that it would not be the correct instrument to speed up the acquisition of land it became clear for us that market values and the encouragement of co operation help and advice from the state would be a better way of promoting the acquisition of land
9157151 we anc said in polokwane we are a caring organisation we dont want to move forward like a guerrilla and say we know it all and our word is final the anc is listening to more voices on this matter to find a solution which does not unnecessarily undermine the property values of this country
9157152 during the whole process of entering government there are a lot of skills which left the public sector and mainly white skills
9157153 at the moment we have the money but we have a problem with the skills levels in the public sector we need to increase the capacity of the state to deliver
9157154 theres no such thing as white poverty the problem of poverty and unemployment must be addressed holistically by government working with the private sector and ngos and other stakeholders together we must find ways of ensuring that when land moves from white hands to black hands that theres skills transfer to the new owners so that productivity continues
9157155 the fact that the anc is brave enough to say these things about skills lost and the expropriation bill is positive this is not a racial argument its a management argument up until now it has also been politically incorrect to talk about white poverty because people think it doesnt exist
9157156 it went very well it has definitely achieved what we wanted
9157157 we cant say they are all carried out by a syndicate in terms of the polices definition of a syndicate but they are definitely organised
9157158 the fact that house burglaries are on the decrease and robberies are on the increase shows that criminals are becoming more brazen and willing to attack when people could confront them
9157159 even though house burglaries have decreased over the past six years they are still a huge concern
9157160 we have seen it with atm bombings in 2006 there was a surge in cash in transit heists but as soon as the police target hardened and put huge support behind beating the crime with intelligence and security improvements the criminals changed their focus to atms
9157161 in the past criminals would steal big things like clothing and bedding
9157162 now criminals are stealing valuable items that they can easily get rid of and that will fetch them a high price and attract the least attention
9157163 as people protect their homes more it has motivated criminals to change how they carry out the attacks
9157164 it is easy to surprise you in your house and force you to switch off the alarm and hand over the valuables and your bank pins it is more lucrative
9157165 we have allowed criminals to take the lead in crime we respond to what criminals do and they innovate based on that
9157166 the more we spend on private security the more they innovate
9157167 they expect resistance they come in groups and they organise they are prepared to meet fire with fire
9157168 before we had armed responses they could break in when we were not there now that we have private security they have to come when we are there
9157169 people who would have indulged in opportunistic crime now arrive armed and expecting a violent confrontation
9157170 private security can only reduce crime it can only displace it
9157171 we should be thinking of constructive crime prevention methods and community building interventions

9157173 the only new but absurd suggestion from the mdc was that the cabinet be co chaired by president mugabe and tsvangirai

9157175 i am not at liberty to outline any of our positions until i get the green light from my authorities
9157176 it zanu pf said from its perspective all that remained was for the mdc to append its signature to the document or withhold it for as long as it likes knowing fully well that the process of forming a government would proceed unhindered

9157222 it is hard to think of a more cynical and contemptuous political act this year than john mccains selection of sarah palin as his vice presidential running mate
9157223 palin is the epitome of tokenism exactly what conservative republicans have always claimed to scorn until today as the politics of quotas and political correctness even rush limbaugh is a feminazi now at least until election day
9157224 but if palins r sum is limited to put it politely she possesses the only two qualities that mccain now seems to consider essential she is a right wing religious ideologue with female gender characteristics
9157225 when cnn political correspondent dana bash interviewed mccain last april she mentioned his joke that one of the two main tasks of the vice president is to check on the presidents health every day a job of particular importance in his case
9157226 i think about whether that person who i select would be most prepared to take my place and that would be the key criteria sic
9157227 sometime between then and now a focus group must have told mccain and his handlers that the experience argument wasnt cutting against barack obama that the nomination of joe biden as obamas running mate had eviscerated it completely and that instead he and his consultants had better find a way to corral disgruntled hillary clinton supporters or forget about winning come november
9157228 clearly nobody in the republican camp is concerned that palin would be clueless in a national security crisis should a 72 year old or older president mccain abruptly die or become disabled
9157229 even as a political tactic choosing palin may well backfire
9157230 i believe that someday we are going to have a woman president possibly during my life and ive often thought the best way to pave the way for this was to first nominate and elect a woman as vice president but i think mondale made a serious mistake when he picked geraldine ferraro as his running mate in my view he guessed wrong in deciding to take a congresswoman that almost nobody had ever heard of and try to put her in line for the presidency i dont know who among the democrats might have been a better choice but it was obvious mondale picked geraldine ferraro simply because he believed there was a gender gap where i was concerned and she was a woman

9157251 he would not africanize america for america has too much to teach the world and africa

9157253 i ran for the presidency despite hopeless odds to demonstrate the sheer will and refusal to accept the status quo
9157254 the next time a woman runs or a black or a jew or anyone from a group that the country is not ready to elect to its highest office i believe that he or she will be taken seriously from the start in this country everybody is supposed to be able to run for president but that has never really been true
9157255 the united states government made the negro a citizen will it protect him as a citizen this is the problem
9157256 it made him a soldier will it honor him as a patriot this is the problem it made him a voter will it defend his right to vote this i say is more a problem for the nation than the negro and this is the side of the question far more than the other which should be kept in view by the american people

9157262 svendita ad air france che il governo prodi intendeva realizzare
9157263 creare una alitalia nuova una compagnia aerea pi efficiente finanziariamente in equilibrio tecnologicamente avanzata
9157264 almeno allinizio ci sono da fare dei sacrifici perch le passate gestioni dellalitalia non possono essere cancellate con un colpo di bacchetta magica
9157265 si deve procedere a un ridimensionamento del personale il cui numero attuale non compatibile con una gestione economicamente sana dellazienda
9157266 il personale in eccedenza si trover in una situazione su cui riteniamo di dovere noi intervenire non sar certo abbandonato perch non giusto che siano i singoli a pagare gli errori delle gestioni del passato e non saranno abbandonati neppure i piccoli risparmiatori che in alitalia hanno creduto investendo in titoli azionari ed obbligazionari della compagnia
9157267 se la nuova compagnia aerea dovesse ritenere utile allearsi con una compagnia straniera questa potr entrare solo come socio di minoranza
9157268 in condizioni meno favorevoli per litalia per i lavoratori i consumatori e gli azionisti
9157269 e facile fare i miracoli con i soldi degli italiani scaricando il buco dellalitalia sulle spalle dei cittadini
9157270 per valutare limpatto che il nuovo piano di ristrutturazione di alitalia avr sulla citt di roma

9157286 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9157287 s al voto di preferenza il giovanile motore del partito
9157288 si propone come motore del partito sul territorio giovani e giovanissimi mettono a disposizione il proprio tempo libero perch credono che questa iniziativa proposta da casini in prima persona possa rafforzare la nostra democrazia in quanto pi autorevole il parlamentare eletto a seguito del voto di preferenza di migliaia di cittadini piuttosto che il parlamentare nominato insindacabile dalle segreterie di partito ridotto troppo spesso di conseguenza al ruolo di yes man
9157289 i gazebo per la raccolta delle firme saranno solo il primo impulso per rodare la macchina del gruppo giovani e raccogliere le prime impressioni delle persone illustrando nel contempo le linee guida del nostro partito che vede giorno dopo giorno premiare la coraggiosa scelta identitaria dello scorso aprile
9157290 del resto aggiunge piersante morandini coordinatore nazionale a margine dellassemblea tenuta in data 25 agosto con i giovani di arezzo lentusiasmo di arezzo contagiante non un caso che proprio ai ragazzi di arezzo richiesto uno sforzo notevole per dare il benvenuto ai giovani di tutta italia alla festa nazionale dellunione di centro che si terr a chianciano terme si dall11 al 14 settembre
9157291 il presidente pierfendinando casini sa di poter trovare nei giovani una locomotiva di entusiasmo e grinta per rinnovare dal basso questa nostra italia
9157292 non certamente casuale la citt sta divenendo sempre pi il capoluogo di tendenza della valdichiana oltre ai numerosi vip che la rendono trendy la citt sta diventando un must anche per i politici italiani indipendentemente dallo schieramento politico naturale quindi che i giovani abbiano scelto una localit cool per mettersi alla prova in vista dellimpegno che li vedr protagonisti a chianciano
9157293 fanculo agli altri fottuti cani che abbaiano sempre io ottengo quello che voglio solo con lo sguardo

9157299 sar un presidente ha detto che guarda al futuro e non al passato ma ricordatevi queste elezioni non sono su di me ma riguardano voi tutti
9157300 vista la grande enfasi e nello stesso tempo linconsistenza dei fatti a me attribuiti da panorama dice lex presidente del consiglio che parla subito dopo lintervento in proposito del premier silvio berlusconi non vorrei che lartificiale creazione di questo caso politico alimentasse il tentativo o la tentazione di dare vita nel tempo pi breve possibile ad una legge sulle intercettazioni telefoniche che possa sottrarre alla magistratura uno strumento che in molti casi si dimostrato indispensabile per portare in luce azioni o accadimenti utili allo svolgimento delle funzioni che le sono proprie da parte mia conclude prodi non ho alcuna contrariet al fatto che tutte le mie telefonate siano rese pubbliche
9157301 la pubblicazione di intercettazioni telefoniche riguardanti romano prodi a cui va la mia assoluta solidariet non che lennesima ripetizione di un copione gi visto e grave che ci accada e il parlamento deve sollecitamente intervenire per evitare il perpetuarsi di tali abusi che tanto profondamente incidono sulla vita dei cittadini e sulle libert fondamentali
9157302 sar un presidente ha detto che guarda al futuro e non al passato ma ricordatevi queste elezioni non sono su di me ma riguardano voi tutti
9157303 no a ingresso nel pdl con pd dialogo e non intese
9157304 se lofferta quella di entrare nel pdl noi rispondiamo di no perch ci saremmo gi entrati qualche mese prima delle elezioni e con veltroni dialogo in parlamento punto e basta senza equivoci di natura politica
9157305 e comunque facile prevedere precisa che nella gran parte dei casi sar fisiologico una conferma delle alleanze locali con le forze di centrodestra con le quali c un rapporto che dura da pi di 10 anni
9157306 proprio per questo dice cesa teniamo una posizione distinta dal partito democratico evitando di sovrapporre la collaborazione istituzionale tra le forze dellopposizione con lintese politiche che non ci sono
9157307 rafforzare unarea autonoma e centrale della politica italiana larea occupata finora dalludc e che attraverso la fase costituente si allargher a nuovi soggetti
9157308 quando il governo ci ha prospettato in parlamento alcune questioni che noi ritenevamo utili agli italiani sottolinea cesa abbiamo tenuto un atteggiamento positivo quando invece si trattato di opporci come e accaduto per il dpef abbiamo assunto una posizione critica
9157309 una riforma organica che non sia rivolta contro qualcuno ma guardi agli interessi dei cittadini
9157310 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9157311 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9157312 marted scorso sono venuto ad arezzo con lunica premura di aver invitato tutti i membri del comitato provinciale uscente per ringraziarli del lavoro svolto durante le elezioni ai presenti ho illustrato il programma dibattuto nellultima direzione nazionale udc
9157313 la linea politica del partito prosegue quella del segretario cesa e di pier ferdinando casini che ci pone alternativi alla sinistra e non annessi al pdl sicuri di esser la spina dorsale del partito popolare europeo in italia il mio compito come commissario quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale affinch gli organi dinformazione possano porre lattenzione su di unazione politica importante senza dar adito a polemiche strumentali che interessano solo chi le alimenta
9157314 in tal senso spiega abbiamo gi attivato nelle maggiori citt della provincia lapertura dei gazebo per la raccolta delle firme per la reintroduzione del voto di preferenza nella legge elettorale avremo poi la festa nazionale di chianciano terme 11 14 settembre p v che ci vedr protagonisti vista la vicinanza geografica dopodich avvieremo una seria verifica con gli iscritti al fine di giungere alle scadenze elettorali 2009 con una definita compagine politico amministrativa
9157315 non possiamo dunque accettare che qualcuno parli sin dora di alleanze con chicchessia chiarisce pur senza dimenticare che la nostra storia ci vede da sempre in provincia di arezzo alternativi alla sinistra in qualsivoglia amministrazione
9157316 ludc valuta positivamente le aperture che ci vengono a livello locale e regionale dagli esponenti del centro destra ma al di l di quelle non vi sono stati ancora incontri ufficiali giudico prematuro e fuorviante parlare di alleanze politiche in questo momento chi ha voglia di impegnarsi nelludc ha la possibilit di farlo sia nel partito sia nelle amministrazioni locali alla ricerca del bene comune e dellinteresse generale
9157317 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale

9157350 put on your sunday clothes theres lots of world out there
9157351 c voglia di tornare a vincere anche se difficile ripertersi
9157352 me lo sentivo lavevo detto a mia moglie e anche ad alcune persone qui al club era destino
9157353 ancora nulla gi non mi piace giocare contro le squadre italiane figuriamoci con la juventus mi hanno dato la possibilit di vincere due scudetti che nonostante tutto continuo a sentire miei lopportunit di tornare a livelli importanti mi dispiaciuto andar via cos ma dopo il mondiale dissi al club che se in a sarei rimasto anche a 50 con la retrocessione in b se fosse arrivata unofferta dallestero avrei preferito andar via
9157354 la stessa che hanno ricevuto gli altri che se ne sono andati io i tifosi li capisco loro vanno allo stadio tutte le domeniche e hanno il diritto di pensare e dire ci che credono accetter il verdetto con serenit perch quando ero li mi hanno trattato non bene di pi lasciarsi sempre brutto ma ci tengo a ribadire che io prima di andarmene ci ho pensato e ripensato e alla fine ho preso la mia decisione molto molto a malincuore lasciandomi alle spalle grandi ricordi
9157355 sono storie diverse motivazioni differenti per penso di poter dire che torniamo tutti con grande piacere personalmente una gioia vedere i miei ex compagni di nuovo in champions cosa impensabile solo due anni fa
9157356 decisamente negli altri ci sono due squadre forti e due pi abbordabili noi abbiamo grandi club come real e juve e lincognita zenit duro
9157357 non lo so bisognerebbe chiederlo alla societ abbiamo dimostrato di poter fare bene in liga siamo un gran gruppo abbiamo continuit siamo tosti per sicuramente per vincere la champions c bisogno di qualcosa in pi probabilmente lo cercavano in qualche giocatore che purtroppo non venuto in ogni caso ce la giochiamo
9157358 le quattro inglesi davanti per organizzazione forza abitudine a lottare poi spagnole e italiane in spagna real e barcellona atletico e villarreal pi indietro valencia e siviglia in italia alla pari juve milan e inter che ha la complicazione del cambio di allenatore la roma penser pi alla champions visto che ha la finale in casa
9157359 in champions lo zenit se passa il turno pu andare lontano in liga vorrei che non ce ne fossero in italia spero il napoli la cosa importante che in serie a finalmente si tornati ad essere competitivi oltre alle squadre gi citate ci sono fiorentina udinese palermo sampdoria il livello ottimo
9157360 si per diverse ragioni un gran giocatore cambiare aria aiuta a ritrovare stimoli e voglia e poi in questi giorni gli ho visto fare dei test di velocit non penso li abbia mai fatti in 5 anni di barcellona
9157361 discorso pi complicato stato via due anni e ha parecchie cose da dimostrare non sar facile
9157362 a roberto dico grazie ha fatto un gran lavoro e non era semplice a lippi non c molto da dire sa quanto complicato ripetersi ma da parte di tutti noi c una enorme voglia di tornare a vincere

9157367 benissimo julio un gran professionista garantisce un ottimo rendimento ha qualit forza stato un ottimo ottimo acquisto
9157368 siamo qui che aspettiamo mancano ancora tre giorni il punto che quando uno vuole andar via non deve fare dichiarazioni sui giornali non mai una cosa positiva meglio parlare con la societ cercare di trovare una soluzione senza sollevare un polverone cos comunque lha capito anche lui e io spero che resti robinho un ragazzo eccezionale sempre positivo sorridente se rester non ci saranno problemi anzi
9157369 non lho vista leuropeo iniziato male ed finito peggio io ci tenevo tantissimo era lultimo per me e mi ero preparato bene stato duro guardare i miei compagni senza poter giocare senza allenarmi
9157370 no sanno benissimo che contro litalia la spagna ha sofferto non hanno vinto non hanno segnato le occasioni migliori le abbiamo avute noi loro hanno fatto giusto qualche tiro da fuori gli abbiamo lasciato il possesso ma non granch e poi non perdo loccasione di ricordare loro che i campioni del mondo continuiamo ad essere noi

9157637 un partido as de igualado depende de dos o tres puntos y el que los ganas se lleva el partido y l hoy los ha jugado mejor que yo
9157638 el se ha puesto a sacar bien y pese a todo he tenido oportunidades en todos los sets de irme adelante y a este nivel si no las aprovechas acabas perdiendo ha sido un partido igualado que pod a ir a un lado u otro pero en los puntos m s importantes l ha jugado mejor
9157639 ha habido un juego clave en el segundo set con tres iguales y 40 40 he tenido punto f cil para ganar y no he definido bien el ha ganado ese juego y se ha ido arriba definitivamente igualmente en el tercero tambi n he tenido varios puntos de break y no los he aprovechado
9157640 el p blico ha estado incre ble muy involucrado y as disfrutas jugando aunque si ganas todav a m s
9157641 vale la pena esforzarse para terminar lo m s arriba posible
9157642 el a o pasado termin el 26 y fue el mejor de mi carrera y ste creo que aunque no jugara m s partidos acabar a entre el 15 y el 18 vale la pena hacer un esfuerzo lo que queda de este final de temporada para tratar de terminar lo m s arriba posible y si es posible en shanghai
9157643 nunca lo hab a visto jugar y pregunt un poco por ah me dijeron que de fondo no ten a ning n golpe que era normalito y ha entrado al partido y me ha hecho un ventilador
9157644 luego hablar con las personas que me lo han dicho y se lo dir
9157645 me ha sorprendido mucho el nivel con el que ha jugado desde dentro era un locura cuando no le apretaba y le hac a algo dif cil l me devolv a golpes ganadores no entend a como l estaba jugando tan bien el juego que ha tenido hoy no se corresponde con su r nking hab a momentos en los que ya no sab a qu hacer en la pista

9157648 ltimamente ven a jugando bien pero los resultados no acompa aban pero hoy creo que ha sido un partido muy completo y me voy contento porque cuando entrenas bien y los resultados no salen est s un poco fastidiado

9157668 kalau dengan ketokohannya dia bisa turun ke bawah melihat masyarakat mengambil aspirasinya dan selanjutnya akan diperjuangkan di dewan swetelah duduk saya kira tidak susah
9157669 15 persen adalah mekanisme partai yang harus dijalankan tetapi kalau memang tidak ada yang mencapai 15 persen memang dia tidak layak duduk sebagai anggota dewan karena tidak mendapat dukungan dari masyarakat tetapi kalau di atas 15 persen saya kira layak duduk jadi yang saya maksud kalau duduk ia benar benar keterwakilan masyarakat bukan keterwakilan golongan atau kelompok lain untuk itulah kita mengkombinasikan antara uu nomor 10 dengan mekanisme partai 15 persen
9157670 yang menjadi patokan adalah bagaimana bekerja dan bagaimana mendekati masyarakat serta mengambil hati masyarakat untuk diperjuangkan kepentingannya jika nanti duduk harus melihat kepentingan masyarakat itulah program pdi perjuangan yang harus diperjuangkan
9157671 kami juga akan gencar mensosialisasikan ketua umum pdi perjuangan sebagai presiden mendatang
9157672 dalam safari ramadan nanti kami akan turun dengan h ahmad jefri rantung mba yang menamatkan pendidikan s1 dan s2 nya di amerika serikat sebagai caleg nomor urut satu untuk dpr ri dan mensosialisasikan caleg lain intinya bagaimana mengambil simpati masyarakat untuk kemenangan pdi perjuangan dan megawati soekarnoputri sebagai presiden
9157673 dan setelah kita amati target yang diberikan dpp sangat wajar dan kami optimis akan mencapainya
9157674 dengan kekuatan dan simpatisan serta tokoh tokoh partai yang turun ke bawah mensosialisasi program partai dan ibu megawati saya optimis target itu bisa tercapai

9157691 ma nellimperfetto mondo che ci tocca vivere oggi wordpress una piattaforma per smanettoni che assaporano con gioia ogni singolo minuto dedicato ai numerosi e frequenti troppo numerosi troppo frequenti compiti amministrativi
9157692 mi pare inoltre che il codice html stia rapidamente perdendo importanza a favore dellxml per cui alla fin fine qualsiasi piattaforma vale laltra se in grado di produrre un feed rss decente
9157693 la qualit dei contenuti di un blog accresce notevolmentese il layout graficamente originale dimpatto e semplice da navigare
9157694 questa ovviamente la mia personale opinione spero che tu non sia daccordo e ti prego di dissentire vigorosamente
9157695 inoltre mi sembra degna di nota la conversazione nata dal post di gianandrea piu di 20 commenti uno meglio dellaltro
9157696 fin quando riesco ad associare una storia ad ognuno di loro
9157697 se non voglio che tu mi segua per qualunque motivo semplicemente basta che ti tolgo dai followers e automaticamente mi dovrai chiedere di poter essere mio following e io ti dovr accettare o meno

9157756 the whole tournament they penalty corners werent good for me now it was the right time to make the goal fortunately we made it
9157757 we work as one team there are no individual players i think that was the key everybody fighting for the other teammates
9157758 we knew what we had to do when germany were over us
9157759 i think always when you are not good on penalty corners you lose we had enough corners today to score
9157760 i dont know how often it happens that you play a big country like spain and for them to not score
9157761 we could not find solutions to score goals around their defense and we did the same mistakes as we did in the last game
9157762 but we tried until the end we all fought to the end

9157779 ik was precies het ocmw deze week heel wat spelers kwamen bij mij klagen vooral over wat in de pers is verschenen of volgens hen uit de context is gerukt gillet hoopt dat zin uitspraken over de olympische ploeg die hem door de journalisten in de mand zijn gelegd niet zijn plaats bij de rode duivels gekost hebben losada zegt dat hij nooit heeft verklaard dar hij ongelukkig is bij anderlecht met zijn huidige situatie maar weet ook hoe moeilijk het is om over te stappen naar een topclub
9157780 will sunday be strange i am 100 per cent for villa thats all ill be doing that wont be strange at all ive spoken to the manager and ive no problem giving 100 per cent for aston villa and that will be starting against liverpool on sunday
9157781 all i can do is give 100 per cent for the club that is all the fans will want to see anyway i am sure that will be enough
9157782 am i here for the long haul i always take things a season at a time this speculation happened at the end of last season and it has been decided ill be staying at villa ill take this season now
9157783 concentrate on that and hopefully we can improve on last season
9157784 do i feel hung out to dry over what has happened that is what the football business is all about i am contracted to villa they set a fee and it wasnt matched rules are rules
9157785 the manager knows i will be giving 100 per cent for himself and the club and that will be fine for everyone its also nice hearing team mates want you to stay we have a great dressing room you want everyone to stay really but i would have been disappointed if they wanted me to leave
9157786 the manager decided to change the captaincy and ive got no problem with that nigel reo coker has done it and martin laursen has done it i enjoyed being captain but it wont affect my performances
9157787 i feel i am getting back to my best it is going to take a while it wasnt the ideal pre season for me the games are always the best thing it was a nice run out even if it was at left back
9157788 how far am i away from my peak i dont know i suppose everyone will wait for top performances and then say im fit so i suppose ill have to start producing some of those
9157789 qpr have always had good entertaining showman type players and that is what their fans demand
9157790 the little argentinian is certainly one of them and we have to be well aware of him
9157791 he likes to come in off the right and smack the ball and is certainly one of their dangerous players
9157792 qpr have brought some very very good footballers over the summer and they will be there or thereabouts come the end of the season
9157793 we were disappointed not to beat derby at home after a really solid first half performance
9157794 that we are disappointed to have drawn with a team that was in the premiership last year shows how far we have come over the last 12 months
9157795 we want to make ashton gate a place where we get the majority of our points because that is where they have to come
9157796 we were disappointed with what happened at crewe but we have to bounce back
9157797 we need to get more quality crosses in and shots on goal because that was something that was poor the other night
9157798 it will be a great footballing game and we have to make sure that we dont play in a way that suits them
9157799 they are very good when they have the ball but so are we
9157800 it will be up to us to try and wrestle the ball away from them and create opportunities and do better with them than we did at crewe
9157801 sometimes teams who lose the play off final can find the following season something of a hangover but i cant see that happening with city
9157802 gary johnson was my manager at cambridge and i know he isnt someone to dwell on the past
9157803 city are a footballing side and theyre a well supported club with the potential to be a massive force
9157804 they beat coventry who had won all their games up to then and although they lost in the carling cup at crewe i know they rested some key players so well certainly be showing them respect
9157805 we should have won at ashton gate last season so we want to put that right this time and although i think a point would be a good result well be going there for all three
9157806 we want to play at the highest possible level with the best possible facilities and thats what im going to work towards and thats what gary johnson is going to work towards as well
9157807 we have our own plan of how we go about doing things thats not going to change we go about our job quietly but efficiently if you look at the record over the last however many years theres been constant investment in the football club and thats all you can ask for
9157808 we are working on opportunities to take the club forward and were there to compete with the likes of qpr
9157809 the stadium is progressing satisfactorily its a long process so there are no sudden announcements to make its on target at the moment and thats all i can really say there are lots of difficult decisions to be made and we are working our way through those
9157810 we knew qpr would spend some money in the summer and bring in some good foreign players
9157811 with their italian links theyve been able to get in a few from the italian league and theyve got the lad from real madrid those players wouldnt normally be coming to the championship if it wasnt for finances of qpr
9157812 it happens in other places at liverpool rafael benitez has brought in spaniards as has roberto martinez at swansea arsene wenger brought a french influence to arsenal and weve brought a yeovil influence to bristol city ive been very happy with that by the way
9157813 weve also been spreading the net ourselves and believe we know whats out there at the right time well do the right thing
9157814 at the moment were third in the league and want to stay up there we have to produce the kind of performance we did in the first half against derby for both halves tomorrow
9157815 we had worked very hard on saturday and maybe i should have made some changes but we wanted to keep the continuity
9157816 nobody wanted to be rested but our mental game wasnt good and the quality wasnt there we let crewe dictate and when that happens you get beat
9157817 jornada 1 atl tico de madrid v m laga cf
9157818 we feel the americans have no intention of building the stadium
9157819 there is a lot of anger it does not just affect the liverpool fans but also the wider community regeneration is linked to the new stadium the best thing they could do is step aside for new owners to come in
9157820 it the stadium is not good news but we cannot change things
9157821 i understand very well our fans and what they may think but they will understand that i must concentrate on the next match
9157822 our commitment to building a new world class lfc stadium is undiminished
9157823 we will use this period productively and revisit the plans for the stadium to increase its capacity to 73 000 seats

9157830 a man should not let his intimidation by people prevent him from speaking the truth if he knows it witnesses it or hears it
9157831 if it is said that the one who has haya is shy to speak the truth causing him to leave off commanding the good and forbidding the bad and that his haya leads him to shortcomings in fulfilling some obligations as is normally the case i say that this is not true haya rather it is incompetence and weakness and subjugation and it is referred to as haya simply by way of likeness and simile true haya is only when the thing he has haya of doing is truly bad and there is no consideration for what the people consider to be bad when it is in fact something good or vice versa and it is established that the prophet had more haya than a virgin in the innermost portion of her home and he is an example for us in this with this there was nothing to prevent his anger if the limits of allah were violated
9157832 you were the last person who i feared would be overpowered by women i will not eat from your food or enter your homes
9157833 out of respect for the hadith that was narrated to us from the prophet
9157834 i heard mubarak bin fudalah say that he heard from al hasan that the messenger of allah said
9157835 whoever loves that the people stand up for him should prepare his seat in hell
9157836 yes ask me what you want as i have made a pact with allah at the maqam of ibrahim that i would do three things i i will speak the truth if i am asked a question ii i will remain patient if i am tested and iii i will be thankful if i am spared
9157837 you are from the enemies of allah on earth you violate honor and kill based on suspicion
9157838 what do you say about abd al malik bin marwan
9157839 he is worse than you and you are simply one of his many mistakes
9157840 let him go and throw him out into the marketplace
9157841 i will not leave until you all come out to the prayer
9157842 i am carrying al baqarah in my chest either politely be quiet or get out
9157843 whenever i see something that i should speak up about and fail to do so i urinate blood
9157844 i performed the hajj with sufyan and he would come and go with his tongue never ceasing to command the good and forbid the evil
9157845 o aba abdillah this is my ring work for this nation according to the quran and the sunnah
9157846 do you permit me to speak o commander of the believers can i speak with your promise not to harm me
9157847 do not send for me again until i come to you myself and do not give me anything unless i ask you for something
9157848 what made you refuse he only asked you to work according to the quran and sunnah
9157849 i was unable to look at sufyan out of haya and intimidation from him
9157850 fear allah you are in this position and have this power due to the swords of the muhajirin and ansar and their sons are dying of hunger umar made the hajj and spent only fifteen dinar s and he used to shade himself under the trees
9157851 no just be below what you are and above what i am
9157852 i never saw anyone with a more confrontational face for the sake of allah than sufyan
9157853 now has come the time for us to attack them and they will no longer attack us from now on it is we who will march onto them bukhari
9157854 the best of the people are my generation then those who come after them then those who come after them

9157872 it is important to show that stalin acted in a completely rational way as the protector of the system and as a consistent supporter of the transformation of the country into an industrial society administered from a single center as the leader of a country which was threatened with a big war in the most immediate future
9157873 terror was put to the service of the tasks of industrial development
9157874 needed for the solution of defense and other tasks to the far east and to siberia
9157875 the terror was transformed into a pragmatic instrument for the solution of economic tasks

9157877 someone out in a blizzard dressed in the lightest summer clothes is not as exposed as one who wills to be a solitary human being in a world where everything is alliance and accordingly with the selfishness of the alliance demands that one ally oneself with it until the individual protects himself against several alliances by becoming a member of one alliance whereas the solitary as soon as it has become obvious that he does not wish to enter into alliance with anyone has all the alliances joined together as one a grandiose alliance against him

9157902 owen will not be ready as he needs recovery time
9157903 anyone could play against andorra but croatia is different you need players who are 100
9157904 we sent owen to the right specialist and he had the right treatment so it is just a matter of him getting on with it now
9157905 it has not been easy for him having tendinitis can be irritating for a player
9157906 but he has trained for 10 days and it is now important to give him some minutes on the pitch
9157907 i think it the england games will be too early for him he is not ready for that
9157908 they had some players that were dangerous and some guys who did well up top the outside midfielders were strong players for them we saw the game out far too much and sometimes when that happens youre going to get bit and thats what happened to us tonight
9157909 we started to become very predictable just knocking balls forward it was never our intention to sit back and sit the game out but for one reason or another the group did that in the second half
9157910 we had some younger guys i didnt think really found their legs until the middle of the first half it was a choppy game i dont think we were at our best i dont think they were at their best its going to take some time to round into form
9157911 we were comfortable with the one zero lead and in soccer you cant do that one zero even two zero you cant do that ever the guys were tired we had maybe ten minutes left and guys were just trying to see the game out and a lot of times when you do that you end up getting scored on
9157912 i was pretty angry i was just wondering where our team is i didnt even go for it im kind of disappointed in myself more than anything
9157913 i dont think a lot of people are going to expect a lot of us which i can understand we lost a few people fourteen is a pretty generous ranking i believe but i think were going to surprise some people because every game is going to be like this were not going to be an easy team to beat
9157914 they had that one moment where we wont prepared and thats what it came down too
9157915 he trained in the stadium last night said uniteds manager sir alex ferguson of hargreaves
9157916 there is no more we could do we gave him the right platform the right training program and the right tempo so thats a disappointment
9157917 he said he felt his knee he said he wasnt fit enough to play so theres nothing we can do about it if a player declares himself unfit you have to accept that
9157918 he called me and we spoke about steves operation and how long it would be benitez said
9157919 everything was really positive if wed delayed it then he might have been out for even longer fabio capello understands this
9157920 our doctor is in contact with doctors of the national team but the decision is our decision steven couldnt play and was struggling with the problem he had and was always in pain
9157921 if you talk to our foreign players they also find it strange that they get so much time and space when they play england said storrie who has players such as croatias niko kranjcar at portsmouth
9157922 we allow them to knock the ball about especially at wembley
9157923 very happy at the club despite rumours linking him with west ham
9157924 they are here but that is all you can say about them
9157925 this is a continuation of the efforts made by the city to ensure that the neighbourhood is cleaned up and restored to safety
9157926 its very important we act now we simply cant wait
9157927 to date sunrise hasnt done anything to clean up the site
9157928 the owners of sunrise offered to have the experts attend on the site for the purpose of developing a plan to remove the tanks however the conditions imposed on getting access to the site were such that it was impossible for the experts do to what they were prepared to do it now appears that the city has retained the very experts that sunrise was going to use to do the very same job
9157929 at least they could then react quickly if there was an attack
9157930 the russian forces had to operate in an environment of technical inferiority
9157931 the russian army has shown that it is far more deployable than in the 90s able to get frontline troops in and out in a short space of time
9157932 the greatest evil is not done now in those sordid dens of rime that dickens loved to paint it is not even done in concentration camps and labor camps in those we see its final result but it is conceived and ordered moved seconded carried and minuted in clean carpeted warmed and well lighted offices by quiet men with white collars and cut fingernails and smooth shaven cheeks who do not need to raise their voices
9157933 im not ive never im just me you know ill never do anything amazing for humanity except this

9157982 i have recently written to chief ministers to consider opening up the public stock of buildings of educational institutions of the high school level and above after class hours for those agencies and groups who are engaged in skill development for our youth
9157983 i hope chief ministers will respond positively and agencies that promote skill development in the private and public sector will be able to utilize these new opportunities
9157984 this sector provides employment to over 42 million people it contributes about 45 percent of the total manufacturing output and nearly 40 percent of indias exports

9158037 dear friends the textbook you are holding in your hands is dedicated to the history of our motherland from the end of the great patriotic war to our days we will trace the journey of the soviet union from its greatest historical triumph to its tragic disintegration
9158038 was not a democracy but it was an example for millions of people around the world of the best and fairest society
9158039 a gigantic superpower which managed a social revolution and won the most cruel of wars
9158040 we cant allow anyone to impose a sense of guilt on us
9158041 the domestic politics of the soviet union after the war fulfilled the tasks of mobilisation which the government set in the circumstances of the cold war democratisation was not an option for stalin
9158042 set a task for moscow to pursue a more ambitious foreign policy in the post soviet space
9158043 we thought that if solzhenitsyns gulag archipelago was published the world would turn upside down
9158044 but then an extraordinary thing happened it was published and remained unread
9158045 stalins empire the sphere of influence of the ussr was greater than all eurasian powers of the past even the empire of genghis khan
9158046 when we look one another in the face were neither of us just looking at a face we hate no we are gazing into a mirror thats the tragedy of our age do you really not recognise yourselves in us yourselves and the strength of your will you may think you hate us but what you really hate is yourselves in us our victory will be your victory and if you should conquer then we shall perish only to live in your victory
9158047 this doctrine that equates the soviet union and hitlers germany was and remains a weapon of ideological war not a tool of knowledge the ideology of nazi germany and the ideology of soviet russia had nothing in common

9158063 alcohol taxes have been cut private imports have increased the number of restaurant alcohol licences has increased and opening hours have been extended at both restaurants and state liquor stores
9158064 it is well known that the concentration of licences premises and opening hours have a significant effect on violence and other alcohol related problems
9158065 a historical parallel can be drawn to when the ration book was abolished among those that already drank a lot the greater access led to significantly greater consumption than among other consumers

9158069 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy

9158075 since price has been an omnipresent factor in most markets companies are reticent to consider that it may not be a relevant order winer this misunderstanding often stems from the fact that price comparisons with alternatives will tipically form part of a customers evaluation of a product however for price to be an order winner margins must be low only in such situations will low cost manufacturing be a priority where margins are high price is not an order winner in these types of market customers will compare one price to another not to seek the lowest price but to check that the quoted price is within an acceptable range therefore companies need to recognize the key difference between being price competitive a qualifier and competing on price an order winner
9158076 qualifiers get a company into and maintain it within a market as such they do not win orders but are essential prerequisites for a company to be considered as a potential supplier

9158078 this coming 12 months will be the most difficult 12 months the labour party has had in a generation quite frankly weve got to rediscover that zeal which won three elections and that is a huge problem for us at the moment people are pissed off with us
9158079 we really have to make our minds up are we ready to try and persuade this country to support us for another term because the next 12 months are critical its still there to play for but weve got a hell of a lot to do we patently have not been able to get across what we are for and what we are about

9158091 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
9158092 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
9158093 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
9158094 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
9158095 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
9158096 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
9158097 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9158098 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9158099 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9158100 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
9158101 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

9158164 i have been working as a chartered environmentalist and wildlife photographer in the field of conservation and land management for 30 years within the northern uplands of britain during this time i have developed a passion for the very special nature of islay which has inspired me to portray photographically islays intricate mosaic of habitats and associated wildlife of european importance every year i spend a significant amount of time on islay as i have connections there this has given me an opportunity over many years throughout all the seasons and weather conditions to invest endless hours in the field with my camera seeking interesting wildlife behaviour coinciding with optimum lighting conditions islay is a truly tremendous location to witness nature at its very best especially with the annual migration of birds i launched islay wildscapes in 2007 with the intention of sharing photographically the interrelationships between habitats wildlife seasonal changes and weather conditions on islay the first series of images are islay seasonwatch to convey and pictorially reflect islays constantly changing seasons i have been developing the islay wildscapes website and online shop myself www islaywildscapes co uk where you can see my work for christmas 2008 there is a new stunning range of christmas card images for islay all islay wildscapes images are taken by myself no colour filters have been used and none are digitally faked over the coming months i will be developing the islay wildlife and habitats online resource for wildlife and habitats on islay which will enable people to understand and enjoy more fully the tremendous biodiversity of the island

9158179 my personal experience is that people around here are very conservative with water especially when they have to pay for it
9158180 the ones that do id assume would be the older wells under 50 feet deep that depend on runoff
9158181 with that being said id still encourage people not to waste water
9158182 we prefer to present this special facility to the public when there is some grass and landscaping and when it better resembles a park
9158183 the town council took the unusual step of requesting a meeting between staff developer and residents of the neighborhood to attempt to negotiate a settlement of the case

9158185 we are investigating whether he is operating a business out of a residential property a location not zoned for commercial retail sales
9158186 what it comes down to in this particular case is is it artwork or commercial sales if he wants them to be art as weve currently classified them they cannot be offered for sale
9158187 well art is art and how many pieces of art arent sold everyday
9158188 ive tried to amend everything i can to jump through hoops

9158196 the price of metals has gone through the roof weve always had problems with copper but its really picked up over the last year weve had thieves strip the copper wiring out of houses under construction

9158198 i dont know how to do it its too much for me
9158199 for young kids and teenagers it seems like most parents are getting them unlimited texting it seems like they dont even talk to each other they just text

9158249 gonintendo end of day thoughts checking in on the earthbound marathon
9158250 i guess the main concern for us is andrews commitment to playing for this team and in my opinion you need to be committed 100
9158251 thats all facets of being an international cricketer and we believe for the best interests of this team for the best interests of andrew symonds to have some time away from the game and lets try and get him right as soon as possible to have him back in our team
9158252 andrew was very disappointed but he accepts our decision and i know andrew pretty well and i hope he goes away from this and gets himself right and gets himself back into our team because hes a very important player and we certainly want him as part of our squad
9158253 its so hard to play for this team in my opinion we are the greatest sporting team in the world so we have standards and they might be higher than other teams but if you dont fulfil those standards unfortunately youre not going to be a part of our squad
9158254 i hope he doesnt take it personally because andrew and i are very good friends andrews one of my best friends closest mates so its certainly not personal and i guess thats why weve made this decision because we want andrew back in our team
9158255 we want andrew part of the australian team for as long as he wants to be a part but right now for the best interests of the team and for the best interests of my friend andrew symonds i believe weve made the right decision
9158256 i certainly believe at the moment when weve got such young impressionable faces in our team we need to make sure our senior blokes are 100 spot on to the way they go about presenting themselves and that was an issue that wasnt being carried out with andrew
9158257 hes as close exactly as the words james sutherland used three years ago one more indiscretion and james will tear up his contract
9158258 we need to be clear andrew has committed no serious offence here that in the interests of andrew its about getting the most positive outcome for andrew for the team and for all involved and thats where were headed
9158259 we could have been swept away had it not been for the wedding

9158342 it would obviously be an honour for me to serve the country and for alaskas sake too it would be very good for our future for an alaskan to be serving nationally
9158343 there is little love lost between me and the state party
9158344 sure i have lost the support of the party establishment here
9158345 i was in the kitchen on the phone while martin and tierna and our grandson lewis were in the living room
9158346 the first i heard was all this shouting and tierna screaming one of them picked her up and flung her into the hallway i ran out of the kitchen and there was one of them in hallway pointing the gun at tierna the gun was shaking in his hand i was scared he was going to panic and shoot us both
9158347 i could hear martin pleading for them not to shoot him in front of the children then all i heard was bang bang bang bang one of them was shouting give him another one give him another one
9158348 last year the police raided the house for drugs and two weeks later our house was shot up two weeks ago the psni raided the house again and i told the policemen then that someone would shoot up the house once again once they left
9158349 i pleaded with him so much that he left a note to say there were no drugs found in the house no matter what i told people the word went round this area that 50 000 of cocaine had been found in the house
9158350 someone has a personal vendetta against martin last year they shot up his car and poured acid all over it
9158351 he has no convictions for drugs and has never been in jail but he is being put down as a drug dealer even before this tierna couldnt sleep because she was having nightmares that someone was going to shoot her daddy she cant settle at school because she thinks martin is going to be shot dead if she leaves him alone in the house
9158352 it is absolutely incredible that things have been allowed to get to this level i would find it amazing if civil servants were not pointing out the difficulties that is their job were they instructed not to say anything and if so by who
9158353 who surely should have advised murphy against this malevolent political action
9158354 the depth and breadth of the problems is now clear for everyone to see if the executive is serious about serving with the best interests of the public then they should take a step back from this brinkmanship
9158355 i view this deliberate attempt to subvert the executive as an act of the utmost bad faith
9158356 aside from the fact that peter robinson has no authority to write any letter on any subject on behalf of ofmdfm without the agreement of sinn f in people will be amazed that at a time when there are real outstanding issues to resolve mr robinson has the time to play petty politics the pattern seems to be jim allister raises an issue and it becomes a dup priority
9158357 tottenham offered 16m and thats not enough so thats the end of it
9158358 they tottenham had several weeks of time to buy him and they did not offer 22m like everybody has been writing but just 16m
9158359 none of us expected this it sounds funny to say because he was only 12 but he lived life to the full
9158360 ive never heard anyone say a bad word about him he was so active he was into everything from quad biking to jet skis boxing and he was a great wee gaelic footballer
9158361 stephen was a great son who was a much loved person round here he had asthma but never let that stop him from doing things
9158362 he played gaelic football with his inhaler in his sock everyone round here and up in crumlin where we live has given us their support and we are very grateful
9158363 he was the happiest person he never had a sad face
9158364 when we heard the news i just couldnt believe it he was so loveable when i heard i said thats not stephen but it was
9158365 he had a newspaper round and played out with the other kids im very close to his granny mary and she just cannot believe it
9158366 stephen was just a boy and his death is a wake up call for the government that more needs to be done to prevent this happening again
9158367 the stewarts are a loving caring family and now they have joined the list of families who are suffering in this way how many wake up calls do the giovernment need
9158368 they need to get their act together and start putting proper funding into programmes that prevent suicide the problem is not going away and for someone of 12 to take his own life is devastating young people need support and somewhere to talk about their concerns and problems
9158369 it was an an impromptu visit to the area because we heard there were a lot of people who were very upset
9158370 stephen was just a typical lad who seemed to be coping well it was so hard to see him in the coffin and comprehend how it all happened
9158371 migrant birds are arriving up to a week earlier now than 35 years ago and a number of species have been observed to be breeding here for the first time
9158372 in addition to these gradual trends we will witness more extreme weather events which are the most difficult to predict and yet likely to have the most devastating effects
9158373 the recent flooding and landslide in the smearlagh and feale river areas have decimated the salmon and sea trout stocks in the area the full impact of which is not yet known highlighting the unpredictability of current weather
9158374 whilst the historical trend has been for habitat and changing land uses to have the biggest impact on biodiversity the statement and recent events show that climate change is increasingly affecting many aspects of biodiversity including individual organisms populations and species as well as the composition and functions of ecosystems
9158375 i feel he was let down by the system he had adapted well to dealing with diabetes

9158378 wildlife forms an important part of our natural heritage and we dont intend to tolerate incidents such as this anyone with information should come forward as doing so will help make sure those responsible go before the courts

9158384 those who are net savvy can already bypass the ban anyway
9158385 the existence of the ban may give parents a false sense of security when the reality is that the 100 websites are merely symbolic
9158386 in our focus group discussions with parents and educators aims found that parents and teachers were under the impression that the list of blocked sites had more than the 100 sites and that it provides enough protection for their children though there is some merit in symbolism it would be counter productive if the ban causes such confusion and gives parents a false sense of security
9158387 is not a public chore to be gotten over with
9158388 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
9158389 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
9158390 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
9158391 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
9158392 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
9158393 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9158394 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9158395 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
9158396 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
9158397 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
9158398 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
9158399 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
9158400 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
9158401 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

9158413 this of course is very sad news it is truly a small hearted and provocative decision
9158414 in view of this i made the decision that i couldnt go ahead with my scheduled meeting with mr nami
9158415 i responded that i was definitely willing to meet whenever he wanted to discuss these issues which not only are a result of todays meeting but also the many others that preceded this one regarding the opening of the limnitis checkpoint
9158416 mr nami was there when i arrived and indeed we started a preliminary discussion but i think mr nami felt the need to inform me of this development so he interrupted and told me about it
9158417 but he did express the hope that this would not affect the talks that will begin on september 3
9158418 we must stay calm i was completely calm i state the reasons why i couldnt continue discussions i think it was a calm and correct decision when they are ready to truly talk then we will see what to do
9158419 because it is not possible for negotiations to be taking place under such shadows and provocative actions

9158432 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
9158433 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
9158434 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
9158435 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
9158436 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9158437 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9158438 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
9158439 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

9158458 it is a requirement for boats to have a current certificate and registration number while on the waterways
9158459 it is an offence not to display a current boat certificate and registration number at all times but it also takes up a lot of our time to run checks
9158460 if boaters display their registration numbers it will save us time and we can concentrate on finding those who do not have a licence

9158483 hezbollah succeeded in incorporating the idea of resistance as part of the international anti globalization movements
9158484 through our contacts with these groups we have managed to challenge the idea that hezbollah is a dogmatic terrorist islamist organization and convince part of the international left that we can be a strong partner
9158485 we think of the sacrifices of all the militants in lebanon and palestine and the arab world from islamists to nationalists to arabists or any ideological background they come from
9158486 hezbollah is aware today of the importance of cultivating contacts with the west
9158487 social forums are open spaces of discussion they present an opportunity for a group like hezbollah to participate and give their opinions
9158488 it was a potent symbol that right makes might and that a guerrilla ready to fight for its people can succeed
9158489 some leftist groups refuse to consider what islamist organizations are about their oppressive practices their violations of rights their dogmatic rhetoric

9158491 the only new but absurd suggestion from the mdc was that the cabinet be co chaired by president mugabe and tsvangirai

9158493 i am not at liberty to outline any of our positions until i get the green light from my authorities
9158494 it zanu pf said from its perspective all that remained was for the mdc to append its signature to the document or withhold it for as long as it likes knowing fully well that the process of forming a government would proceed unhindered
9158495 im very confident that there will be an absolute clearance for mr peters in a relatively short period of time
9158496 they are refugees now because they have left their homes they are living in the forests and they should be brought back
9158497 it is the responsibility of the government that these refugees should be brought back and also to send for force if necessary to stop this killing to stop this burning to stop this looting

9158506 i just saw man to man coverage and i just saw that the middle of field was wide open
9158507 near the endzone i kind of peeked back and saw two guys chasing me so i was just thinking dont get caught
9158508 i dont think its all based on this one game honestly
9158509 i think its based on training camp and the whole preseason i think thats how the coaches are going to end up making the decisions its all said and done now theres nothing else we can do im at peace and well see what happens
9158510 the scheme of the defense and guys doing their jobs allowed me to be free
9158511 coming in i had a lot of problems with my size
9158512 people said i wasnt big enough to play but i showed them that i am able to compete with some of the best in the nfl on a daily basis i love the game of football any time i am on the field i am going to try and give it my hardest
9158513 anytime you get a chance to go out and show your skills it is always fun especially for me
9158514 i have been playing football since i was six and it has always been my dream to play in the nfl i was just going to give it my all and hopefully tomorrow i will be a denver bronco i came out and played hard every play i was in i played well on special teams hopefully the coaches saw that i can contribute in a good way to this team whatever happens happens
9158515 as soon as i caught it i was just trying to get to the endzone
9158516 i think when i made the first cutback i saw that i had a lot of blockers i thought ok maybe i can get there this time it feels good to know that you did something to help the team win hopefully i solidified a spot on the team hopefully i made the 53
9158517 i couldnt ask for a better situation getting an opportunity to play in front of my hometown
9158518 i had a lot of family here my dad was scrambling and got about 50 tickets its a dream come true for me thats just finding yourself in a good place at the right time the ball popped right into my hands i saw it as a blessing running down the sidelines i wish i could have scored but i kind of ran out of gas there at the end i had a lot of fun though
9158519 its amazing on the last play to show what i can do
9158520 i made the play it was like a super bowl for me
9158521 it has left the whole family in darkness this episode just because of some i dont know some foolish mistakes from some person

9158536 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9158537 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9158538 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
9158539 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

9158548 im a christian and so although i try not to have my religious beliefs dominate or determine my political views on this issue i do believe that tradition and my religious beliefs say that marriage is something sanctified between a man and a woman
9158549 i think we know that abortions rise when unwanted pregnancies rise so if we are continuing what has been a promising trend in the reduction of teen pregnancies through education and abstinence education giving good information to teenagers that is important emphasizing the sacredness of sexual behavior to our children i think thats something that we can encourage i think encouraging adoptions in a significant way i think the proper role of government so there are ways that we can make a difference and those are going to be things i focus on when i am president
9158550 we can certainly agree on the fact that we should be doing everything we can to avoid unwanted pregnancies that might even lead somebody to consider having an abortion and what i have consistently talked about is to take a comprehensive approach where we focus on abstinence where we are teaching the sacredness of sexuality to our children and i think we should make sure that adoption is an option for people out there

9158565 what we expect is that whenever possible women should have a physical before they get pregnant that way they can be evaluated for risk factors such as being overweight or underweight
9158566 being overweight can lead to complications such as diabetes and being underweight can lead to problems such as low birth weight

9158572 massachusetts which enacted health reform in april 2006 has moved into first place with the lowest uninsured rates 7 5 percent
9158573 this problem isnt going away its only going to get worse
9158574 seeing kansas numbers worsen while the overall national picture has had a slight improvement should encourage policymakers in kansas to redouble efforts to support meaningful health reform
9158575 although we hear criticisms of what other states are doing apparently at the bottom line level getting their citizens health insurance coverage they are making progress
9158576 though short is one of a governor making decisions and senator mccain decided he wanted the next generation represented on his ticket
9158577 in contrast to the massing of blooms typical of flower arrangements in the west ikebana is usually characterized by a line of twigs and or leaves connected by a sparse arrangement of flowers the idea being to give the viewer the sense they have come across a scene in nature
9158578 in ikebana it is common that one of the branches in an arrangement is bent or broken to signify the practitioner has attempted to present the arrangement in a natural state
9158579 each one of us no matter how successful or evolved we might appear to be have imperfections and personal ego attachments
9158580 consider the sense of perfection and pure life force you get when holding a baby its the babys uncontrived and unrestrained expression of their emotional experience that gives us a sense of life at its fullest this is the inherent blessing that exists as the essence of life in its simplest and purest form rather than hoping for love or acceptance the baby expresses who they are and what they feel in this very moment this is the same free flow of energy that the ikebana practitioner strives to express in their floral arrangements we look to strip our work of any contrived sense of beauty so the natural energy and life force of the flowers can be freely expreessed and felt in other words we attempt to present the flowers as they are rather than attempting to add anything extra we strive to let the flowers communicate directly and thus in some way hope to reconnect the viewer to their own heartfelt sense of beauty and perfection
9158581 today there is one more thing i would like to say i am drawn to flower arranging because it helps me understand and come to terms with the impermance of life no matter how beautiful the flowers appear to be when the arrangement is complete i know they will only express their beauty for a few days time by carefully cleaning and cutting the flowers and adding water we can extend their life for a few precious moments but in the end youre left with the understanding that neither the flowers nor any other form of life will last forever one of the most important things we can do in life is appreciate the beauty and perfection that is present in our lives right now rather than lamenting the passing of life by appreciating the fleeting beauty of the flowers you can come to understand the fleeting beauty of your own life and the lives of those you love

9158588 she was a very capable woman mother of nine children successful teacher with some nurses training and someone who made everyone she met feel valued regardless of their social status
9158589 she spoke on behalf of womens suffrage and supported prohibition yet she maintained her southern charm acquired from growing up in tennessee as the cultivated daughter of an esteemed professor
9158590 above all her faith demonstrated her destiny was not by chance but by choice in choosing to relinquish her life to god she knew the bibles promise of strength and peace which gave her the ability to conquer and mold her environment
9158591 if dad was photographing a family often deep in the mountains and found someone who was sick or had a particular problem hed lead my mother back into the woods to their home where she could care for them she became a mid wife and delivered untold numbers of babies i remember she treated a lot of babies for thrush an oral yeast infection and there were burns or accidents to be attended to
9158592 i was the youngest of the family now living in lake toxaway and i heard the stories and saw the love my parents had for others people from all around the area would come to them for help if it was for food or clothing or illness or even for spiritual needs
9158593 all along i felt a personal mandate to tell my parents story and knew i would eventually write it however with marriage to gene our ministry together our three children missionary work in brazil and germany and teaching these books were on hold
9158594 when i retired in 1994 this task which i believed i was given to do was finally underway
9158595 i had already done several years of research and interviews with individuals from transylvania and jackson counties who knew or worked with my parents i found families and churches still with the old black and white photographs taken by my father after hed arrive by horseback truck or foot to record what he knew was a valuable part of mountain history
9158596 my husband gene and i have been in christian work all our adult lives
9158597 and ive met many many people however i have never met anybody that i felt had a better grasp on how to live the true christian life on a daily basis in difficult circumstances than my mother and dad numerous people would agree
9158598 who taught us the joy and satisfaction of good hard work and compassion for others one of the reasons for writing these books was to chronicle their experiences and character for our children and grandchildren today they carry on this valuable legacy this generational blessing from their grandparents
9158599 we really have only one shot at life ive learned that when we present ourselves daily to god as our final authority which we know bone deep we are to do we receive his adequacy in advance to achieve our dreams and goals and his strength for whatever we have to face

9158656 for a while they all talk the talk and nothing happens then in the last four or five days every half an hour there is a headline saying someone has signed somewhere
9158657 when you have experience of transfer dealings you know that as long as something is not signed you know it can change very quickly so you can look very silly so you dont want to come out and announce it
9158658 we are out to look if we find the right players we will do it one or two

9158660 i buy the players i feel strengthen the squad after that i consider the price
9158661 i do the job i think it has to be done considering the resources of the club and considering our ambition and the players we have
9158662 i know the media and supporters sometimes too are happy with big numbers but for me what is most important is big quality sometimes both are linked but not always

9158680 we think there is still a lot of growth potential for the hermes brand which is not yet widely distributed around the world
9158681 given that luxury goods are discretionary expenditure it seems counter intuitive that they are not as affected by the economic slowdown as food spending
9158682 geographical diversification tight control of brand development and distribution network pricing power and size are key factors for their success
9158683 the time horizon for a rewarding investment in the luxury sector seems to move forward as forecasts converge to indicate increasing risks of a recession
9158684 their core brands continue to enjoy strong momentum and are set to gain market share at a time when retailers and consumers seek quality and higher intrinsic value

9158699 not all of them besides it hardly matters anymore within a few weeks theyll all be dead
9158700 i doubt theyll die just because you decided not to water them anymore
9158701 these flowers arent easy to grow you know its not just about the watering i have to feed them fertilizer and trim them regularly and watch them carefully so that no bugs crawl on them

9158721 fifty decibels is maybe a little too restrictive all this might be moot if no manufacturer can build it
9158722 i would hate to go through all this and have an ordinance for something nobody can build anyway
9158723 im not sure why any resident would want more than a 100 foot turbine so you should be fine
9158724 when the wind is blowing hard there are a lot of other things going on leaves in the trees blow and make noise
9158725 fifty to 55 decibels is about normal conversation level i understand why the ordinance committee is being careful about the noise but it may exclude some models

9158787 we would like to put them up in mashpee commons but the decision will be based on an analysis of long term finances these are not a quick return investment
9158788 it is not what you would hope a progressive station like massachusetts would cancel you would hope that they are supporting alternative sources of energy
9158789 it is like putting a solar panel on a north facing roof under a tree it just will not work
9158790 it is really about generating electricity not just putting up something that looks good
9158791 if they are going to give out money we want to make sure these things are going to work
9158792 i know that sounds weird tom but you are absolutely right
9158793 the town was just trying to be responsible in terms of looking out for its residents trying to make sure these things are not going to pop up everywhere if they arent going to work
9158794 unfortunately for them that is absolutely true they are our first wind turbine special permit of any kind
9158795 we have submitted a planning application to build a community owned wind farm at beinn greidaig south of the junction of the pentland road and the a858 5 km west of stornoway
9158796 it will be located on common grazings which are currently used for crofter forestry by the village of sandwick north street it has been selected for its good wind conditions good grid connection potential and because it does not fall within any designated areas of environmental or of landscape importance
9158797 we will install three 3mw turbines with a total maximum generating capacity of 9mw
9158798 this would be the biggest community owned wind farm yet built in britain enough to supply almost 7 000 homes and we expect it to provide half a million pounds profit a year every penny of which will be re invested in the community
9158799 we will invest that money in projects in the point and sandwick districts of lewis but we are very mindful of our wider responsibility to assist the rest of the western isles as well
9158800 we have had positive meetings with snh scottish natural heritage and with the rspb and a final study into adjacent red diver sites will be concluded in september data analysis so for indicates that the wind farm will have no significant effects upon wildlife habitats and the location is an area of boggy moorland character which snh have determined is the most suited visually for wind farms
9158801 the construction and installation of the wind farm will cost around 11 million which is obviously a lot for a small community to have to raise on the commercial markets but i am confident we can do it
9158802 all en per hay un mejor clima laboral y un mejor control contra la violencia le est haciendo muy mal a chile esta idea de que a trav s de la violencia y de la ilegalidad los grupos de presi n pueden satisfacer sus demandas

9158816 se plantea un cuestionamiento sereno ya que desde la tica y la espiritualidad surgen una serie de elementos que llevados a la pr ctica nos platean en qu sociedad estamos viviendo como por ejemplo qu modelo econ mico nos rige y qu efecto tiene en las actitudes y vida de cada uno de nosotros y tambi n plantea una pol tica de estado sobre la relaci n social y el ambiente en que vivimos
9158817 frente a la amenaza ecol gica que estamos viviendo hoy d a un modelo neoliberal tan extremo y tan desencarnado como el que se est llevando adelante en chile creemos que es altamente perjudicial por la destrucci n de la naturaleza y sus recursos especialmente del agua dejada en manos de empresa particulares que ciertamente lo que buscan es el bien propio y no tanto el bien com n

9158860 y el tema desapareci de la agenda de gobierno esta administraci n nunca tuvo realmente una pol tica para enfrentar el conflicto mapuche
9158861 estamos dispuestos a aceptar al mapuche folcl rico aquel que baila con sus trajes t picos y es amable pero no al joven que se viste con chaqueta de cuero y que se nos para de igual a igual exigiendo respeto a sus derechos
9158862 pero se equivocaron quienes creyeron que este asistencialismo iba a desindigenizar a los j venes mapuches al contrario el acceso al conocimiento y a los derechos que hoy se les reconocen internacionalmente a los pueblos ind genas han alentado sus demandas
9158863 el gobierno se enfrenta hoy a una intifada mapuche y ya se dio cuenta de que el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas pero es dif cil saber hasta d nde se va a llegar el problema de fondo sigue siendo el reconocimiento pol tico la existencia de un pueblo y el derecho a la tierra porque como ha demostrado el conflicto palestino israel no hay cultura sin territorio

9158870 the people there mostly men have an illegal status they have no job and no home the jungle is a dangerous place and its not safe to go there
9158871 the prosecutor said he cant say whether the rapist was an illegal immigrant or not but they do know he spoke fluent french
9158872 this suggests he was therefore not actually an illegal immigrant but someone else who was in the wood at that time as most of the illegal immigrants dont speak french
9158873 the immigrants in these camps are very respectful people and many are practising muslims the conditions they live in here are inhumane

9158896 asombra la facilidad con que se estigmatiza a todo el pueblo mapuche
9158897 me asombra la facilidad con la cual a partir de estos hechos se estigmatiza al pueblo mapuche como un todo cuando quienes vivimos en la regi n de la araucan a y conocemos al campesino de esta etnia sabemos que se trata de personas emprendedoras cuya principal preocupaci n radica en sacar adelante a sus familias y en poder trabajar para conseguirlo tal como cualquier chileno
9158898 conozco al pueblo mapuche he visto como se desconocen sus derechos ancestrales he compartido con l desde mi primera infancia he alojado en sus comunidades y s que son los chilenos a los cuales la sociedad otorga menos oportunidades y de los cuales m s se abusa esto llega al punto de que cuando el estado les asigna recursos como ocurre con el programa or genes hay una corte de intermediarios y consultoras de partidos pol ticos que tienen como conducta permanente aprovechar en propio beneficio los dineros que se destinan al pueblo mapuche
9158899 mientras hay subsidio para plantar rboles en los campos de la araucan a y as desplazar a las ciudades al mapuche no hay subsidio para que estos campesinos puedan siquiera mantener una agricultura de subsistencia ello es inducido por las pol ticas de gobierno para expulsar al mapuche de sus tierras y fr amente desruralizar la araucan a
9158900 la injusta estigmatizaci n que cierta prensa hace del pueblo mapuche el aprovechamiento de ciertos pol ticos de los recursos que la ley destina al pueblo mapuche y la desruralizaci n impulsada desde el estado forman parte del clima contrario a la generaci n de paz social que nuestra araucan a necesita para dejar de ser la m s pobre del pa s y ser la regi n perdedora de la cual hablan los organismos internacionales
9158901 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
9158902 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
9158903 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

9158939 da dove cominciare a prendere parola sappiamo che qualsiasi racconto ne prosegue uno precedente e poich non esiste un inizio assoluto ogni prima volta sempre unaltra volta per questo mi sembra importante affiancare alla dominante comunicazione per immagini la trasmissione di racconti di storie di vita vissuta allacciando tra le generazioni il filo di un discorso che veicoli emozioni oltre che dati e informazioni se non vengono tradotte in parole condivise le esperienze passate precipitano nellinsignificanza e nelloblio mentre la volont di dire per usare una bella espressione di mario luzi mantiene aperto un canale comunicativo che aiuta lindividuo ad uscire dalle strettoie del narcisismo e dellegoismo proprietario fondato sullio e sul mio

9158960 en espa a existen unas 2 600 iglesias evang licas y 2 100 est n registradas en nuestra federaci n el resto no se inscribe bien porque son muy recientes porque est n en proceso de constituci n o porque no quieren
9158961 en el mbito protestante los grupos no necesitan el visto bueno de un obispo o de una jerarqu a para funcionar cualquiera puede crear una iglesia y sa es precisamente nuestra debilidad no podemos evitar excesos al amparo de la libertad lo nico que podemos hacer desde ferede es explicarles cu l es la realidad espa ola y acompa arles en el proceso de constituci n los nicos l mites son la legislaci n espa ola y el evangelio
9158962 prefiero hablar de actividades delictivas o que puedan afectar a la personalidad secta no tiene una connotaci n jur dica pero detr s de algunas iglesias hay actividades que pueden ser perseguidas eso es lo que hay que denunciar se trate de una iglesia o de un club de f tbol

9158965 los pentecostales suelen ser de clase baja o incluso de mbitos de pobreza extrema arraigan entre los desarraigados aunque los hay tambi n de clase media y alta e incluso ex presidentes como el guatemalteco efra n r os montt
9158966 son bastantes los latinoamericanos que no eran protestantes antes de venir y que se hacen evang licos en espa a es aqu donde experimentan la proletarizaci n y la anomia tampoco faltan creyentes que fervorosos en sus pa ses de origen pierden en espa a su fe puede que por la prosperidad econ mica o por el deseo de ser aceptados
9158967 igual que la realidad cat lica en ee uu se sostiene por la presencia de inmigrantes latinos aqu en espa a podr a afirmarse lo mismo del movimiento evang lico
9158968 las iglesias evang licas han crecido y sus l deres son aut ctonos no es verdad que sean producto de la penetraci n estadounidense la regi n del mundo que m s misioneros tiene es am rica latina y los manda incluso a am rica del norte
9158969 se estima que hay m s de 9 000 misioneros latinoamericanos trabajando en culturas diferentes a la suya 4 000 en asia frica y europa del este
9158970 la religiosidad evang lica latinoamericana es un fen meno creciente y vigoroso
9158971 en per la poblaci n protestante llega al 12 5
9158972 sus experiencias son menos anodinas autoritarias y fr as que las que suelen tener en la iglesia cat lica incluso cuando el sacerdote procede de medios populares su formaci n le aleja de sus or genes m s que a los pastores pentecostales y la iglesia cat lica cuando se interesa por los pobres adopta una actitud paternalista
9158973 una experta estadounidense afirma que los latinoamericanos cuando se hacen pentecostales dejan de ser psicol gicamente pobres aunque lo sean
9158974 los pueblos que adoptan el protestantismo son pueblos que prosperan porque aprenden a leer a respetar a sus mujeres y adoptan una tica del trabajo que les hace progresar

9159017 demi kebaikan pembeli rumah mungkin kerajaan boleh berbuat sesuatu sama ada dengan melonggarkan polisi pengeluaran kumpulan wang simpanan pekerja kwsp bagi memudahkan mereka membeli atau menambah satu lagi rumah

9159042 we have thoroughly searched department records and located no current non immigrant visa applications for modi however should we receive an application we assure you it will be adjudicated in strict accordance with the immigration and naturalisation act
9159043 the current response from the state department has virtually made narendra modi a persona non grata to the us
9159044 there has been no improvement in the ground situation so far hence the conditions are still not conducive for resuming work today
9159045 this year was difficult because i couldnt really take tournaments off
9159046 i always had to chase the rhythm of playing on that particular surface that i was wanting to play on
9159047 i am concentrating on my own game and physically i am fine
9159048 i was struggling with that stroke but i managed to win at the end so that is the most important thing
9159049 i felt i had some chance but she had lots of heart
9159050 i was not too bad i tried to go to the volley and put pressure on her but i felt my serve was not good i double faulted too much
9159051 i have no idea how she played what the other girl did i have no idea i only heard it on the news
9159052 where arises the question of a peace formula or compromise formula when the fourth round of talks between governors panel and the samitis committee has not taken place so far during the first three rounds of talk on august 23 we have already given written demands to the governors panel headed by his advisor s s bloeria
9159053 the fourth round of talks was delayed twice and is now scheduled for today and we are waiting for it to be held
9159054 the government has to respond to our demands and then the samiti will decide on it
9159055 inflating the currency and then having less product to buy and charging you fees to do it its hyper inflation
9159056 six months before the acceptance of the united nations resolution on a cease fire the regime was planning the execution of political prisoners
9159057 were visiting prisons and said that by the order of ayatollah khomeini an amnesty committee has been established and members were asking the prisoners questions i remember they came to our prison in gohardasht where i was a prisoner they asked some questions and told us that the imams amnesty committee had decided that there should not be any political prisoners left in the prisons at that time we had a lot of optimism and we thought that by the end of war they would release the political prisoners
9159058 the pretext for the execution of religious and non religious political prisoners in the summer of 1988 was quite different
9159059 those with religious affiliations who were mostly from the mujahedin e khalqh pmoi organization went to the gallows as mohareb combatants with god whereas the leftists were executed as apostates i was in the gohardasht prison when the death commission came there and commission member mr nayeris question was are you a muslim or a marxist the destiny of those who answered they are marxist was predetermined
9159060 in the contemporary history of iran the executions of 88 are considered among the most important cases of human rights abuses
9159061 based on international human rights laws the vast scale of those executions and the way that they were carried out unlawfully place those systematic killings in the category of crimes against humanity the iranian government never openly confessed to these executions so the true scope the number of executed prisoners and the precise place of their burial are unknown
9159062 i have to know what happened we want the truth
9159063 those who were condemned to prison terms should not have been executed based on what the clergy says why did they kill them what did they want from them what did they ask what did they mention in their wills what conditions did they endure these are the things that i think should be cleared one day and until then the wounds in our hearts will remain always fresh
9159064 until the time when what is happening in a society and the reasons for disasters and tragic events are examined and those who commit wrongdoing are recognized such crimes could happen again
9159065 youre too big or youre too skinny or youre not this or not that
9159066 in short the radbaz a leading halachic authority from the 1500s ruled that the dome of the rock is the foundation stone in the holy of holies he wrote that without a doubt this is the identity of the place he wrote in a definite way the definite identity of the place
9159067 todays youths are not interested in taking up indigenous crafts after getting education they want to get employed in the government and private companies thus there is a huge dearth of skilled artisans
9159068 if i stop working who will take care of my unit where i have very few employees i am trying to motivate young boys and girls of my village barheta in bihar to take up my art
9159069 they feel that after completing college education they should have a proper job they dont want to struggle like their parents but we are motivating youngsters of the country to take up various indigenous crafts to earn their livelihood and simultaneously save various crafts from dying
9159070 villages are the cradles of indian crafts so we are trying hard to empower artisans to use their inherent skills as a means of earning their livelihood it is sad that in spite of our rich legacy several craftsmen in the country are having to fight hard against poverty
9159071 how does the s2 compare to the original 3 skypephone
9159072 new user interface even easier to use than the original 3 skypephone with a carousel interface which makes switching apps speedy it preserves the integrated skype phonebook so your contacts skype names appear alongside their landline or mobile phone numbers

9159095 i have recently subscribed your site after getting so much frustration in other lesbian sites
9159096 none of us expected this it sounds funny to say because he was only 12 but he lived life to the full
9159097 ive never heard anyone say a bad word about him he was so active he was into everything from quad biking to jet skis boxing and he was a great wee gaelic footballer
9159098 stephen was a great son who was a much loved person round here he had asthma but never let that stop him from doing things
9159099 he played gaelic football with his inhaler in his sock everyone round here and up in crumlin where we live has given us their support and we are very grateful
9159100 he was the happiest person he never had a sad face
9159101 when we heard the news i just couldnt believe it he was so loveable when i heard i said thats not stephen but it was
9159102 he had a newspaper round and played out with the other kids im very close to his granny mary and she just cannot believe it
9159103 stephen was just a boy and his death is a wake up call for the government that more needs to be done to prevent this happening again
9159104 the stewarts are a loving caring family and now they have joined the list of families who are suffering in this way how many wake up calls do the giovernment need

9159220 regrettably the majority of our people spend time at cuca shops abusing alcohol and face a bleak future
9159221 our country faces numerous challenges such as hunger poverty and disease although notable successes have been made over the years we still need to work harder to improve the delivery of quality public services and other social amenities to our people including education health care shelter rural electricity and potable water therefore we must intensify our efforts especially at the regional level in order to ensure that development programmes are implemented speedily
9159222 this gives me an impression that our people are waiting for the government to do everything for them i wish to remind you that this situation will not bring genuine economic independence but will rather create a dependence syndrome among our people our government has laid the foundation for meaningful development
9159223 while the world faces an uncertain economic future due to skyrocketing fuel and food prices it is imperative that we devise effective mechanisms to improve agricultural production and also at the same time embark upon value addition and beneficiation of our agricultural produce such as omahangu omakunde amongst others in order to enhance the competitiveness of our rural economies

9159228 these meetings will give the public information they dont get from our government or dental organizations in the afternoon a panel will address the question of whether toronto should stop fluoridating its water in the evening experts will explain fluorides dangers to health
9159229 the best way that the oda can get communities and politicians to stand up for water fluoridation is to provide in person a cogent and scientifically referenced defense of fluoridation at the afternoon forum
9159230 the best way to lower childrens fluoride intake as health canada suggests is to stop fluoridation

9159259 the church at the best of times is really truly struggling and our parish is one of the most deprived in the borough the congregation is elderly and can you just imagine the pensioners they love their church and all are all generous in their giving and even the sunday school children give their pennies can you imagine taking that money its really disgusting

9159275 this was a wonderful estate and i wanted to live here forever but its not what the council wanted
9159276 i always loved living here because there was such a strong community spirit
9159277 it used to be all families and a lot of the older residents are unhappy about having to leave
9159278 i have lived here all my life and my memories are happy ones i really wanted to stay on the estate but its too late now

9159280 we are currently working with the council to find a suitable alternative its not as sad for us as it is for those people losing their homes but it is still very hard some of the elderly residents who have already moved out still return every friday for our weekly bingo session it is a very sad time for us all

9159387 weve had a very productive week here completing all our programme and accumulating some useful information to prepare for the italian grand prix its always a pleasure to test in monza and thanks to the drivers test team and particularly ferrari bridgestone and our other partners for all their efforts weve had a very useful test that has helped to build on the step in performance that we saw in valencia
9159388 we made some positive steps forward for the italian grand prix particularly with the balance and set up i could push particularly in the afternoon and the pace over the longer runs was also good you never know what the other teams are doing with their own programmes but i think the race will be very close between us and honda i think weve made good progress here

9159408 however the analysis is still ongoing and no decisions have yet been made
9159409 my sense is that i will be able to make a recommendation at that time for some further reductions
9159410 youre going to see a lot of people who are extremely skeptical it would seem that you would need a little more time
9159411 a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs

9159417 to go out there and be productive and to be able to walk off the field and say hey i played pretty well and my leg didnt hurt at all will be huge for him mentally
9159418 as i recall a lot of the pro scouts we had coming through here their next stop was up there
9159419 i would think that would have to be a factor and understandably so no matter what the attendance may end up being obviously maine is not going to travel many people our fans have been tremendous the challenges of our state are more paramount than our attendance on saturday

9159425 to be able to honor bill willis a pioneer of the sport to be able to don that no 99 jersey for the last time at ohio state i know this is big
9159426 ever since i have constantly reminded curtis of what an honor it is
9159427 i started wondering whether i was really worthy of wearing it
9159428 this is a man who is in the high school college and pro football halls of fame he broke the color barrier in pro football he was a great man
9159429 the ohio state university has great academic programs and i think all 24 commitments including myself realize its a great place to receive a degree in whatever field we want to pursue
9159430 you can see where theyre ranked going into this season
9159431 it was spring break and we didnt have anything to do so my father and i were just driving around and went to some practices
9159432 people started saying things on the internet that were not true i have not second guessed anything im going to be a buckeye
9159433 you dont have to go out of state to play big time football
9159434 whenever running backs coach dick tressel tells us to go watch the youngstown or akron game films im like aw i hate watching them
9159435 honestly the youngstown state game was statistically and physically the worst game i ever played in my life since ive been playing football and ive been playing football since i was 6 years old
9159436 if you go back and look at the game he was so anxious
9159437 every time he got the ball he wanted to just go run for a touchdown and probably didnt have his eyes on the task of how things were unfolding and the blocking scheme he just wanted to go because he was so excited
9159438 so were watching the film of the youngstown state game and its kind of like man what were we doing we were not focused and thats why this week this offensive line will come out smacking right away
9159439 i just really wasnt focused in on anything basically just being lazy
9159440 im lollygagging around on the football field and it turned around to bite me on the butt in the end
9159441 right after i took a shot from missouri i was so nervous about getting hit that it really started to affect my game
9159442 the couple games after that everything started going bad and my confidence started to drop
9159443 i anticipate that because were two of the top quarterbacks in the country
9159444 you always look for an on the field battle i think well see a great one
9159445 you factor any way you can to have all of your possible weapons available to become as good as you can most especially at the quarterback position
9159446 chris leak is our quarterback and tim tebow is going to be a guy who plays
9159447 art was an outstanding talent no doubt about it but im not sure he was ready for that arena as a true freshman
9159448 he had kind of a rough opening day if you remember something like five interceptions plus a bunch of sacks
9159449 hes a winner we knew that coming out of high school
9159450 you dont just do what he did accidentally i think his background was certainly helpful i think that all makes up what he is
9159451 i think he knows when he has the ball in his hands he can make something special happen on almost every play
9159452 everything ive heard about the kid is hes a cut above hes like vince young
9159453 there are not many guys who come around like that in college football
9159454 rices first team was very so so and there was nothing behind it
9159455 if this is what all the gurus wanted out of college football to make everybody try to beat somebody by 100 because it will help your ranking somewhere along the line you say does the end justify the means
9159456 im not going to apologize for my kids playing hard
9159457 we have to be careful because when you have inexperienced players you have to teach fundamentals and scheme
9159458 we dont want to overload them on schemes and forget the fundamentals
9159459 our focus with them is more not to worry about who will be starter but on getting both of them ready to play
9159460 he could play in syracuse of the american hockey league but thats a tough thing to ask of an 18 year old
9159461 well get a chance to see him in training camp and make the call
9159462 the head coaches dont run the teams in the national football league
9159463 in the old days if guys got into a fight it was who won
9159464 i guess the world is divided up between redeemers and non redeemers
9159465 i happen to be a redeemer i think people can be made better and right if thats a fault so be it these guys misstepped they made mistakes they paid prices for it that have been verging on ruinous but that doesnt mean i dislike them personally
9159466 theyre going to make decisions that they think are best
9159467 and marvin and the players and all the coaches do the best with what weve got
9159468 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9159469 s al voto di preferenza il giovanile motore del partito
9159470 si propone come motore del partito sul territorio giovani e giovanissimi mettono a disposizione il proprio tempo libero perch credono che questa iniziativa proposta da casini in prima persona possa rafforzare la nostra democrazia in quanto pi autorevole il parlamentare eletto a seguito del voto di preferenza di migliaia di cittadini piuttosto che il parlamentare nominato insindacabile dalle segreterie di partito ridotto troppo spesso di conseguenza al ruolo di yes man
9159471 i gazebo per la raccolta delle firme saranno solo il primo impulso per rodare la macchina del gruppo giovani e raccogliere le prime impressioni delle persone illustrando nel contempo le linee guida del nostro partito che vede giorno dopo giorno premiare la coraggiosa scelta identitaria dello scorso aprile
9159472 del resto aggiunge piersante morandini coordinatore nazionale a margine dellassemblea tenuta in data 25 agosto con i giovani di arezzo lentusiasmo di arezzo contagiante non un caso che proprio ai ragazzi di arezzo richiesto uno sforzo notevole per dare il benvenuto ai giovani di tutta italia alla festa nazionale dellunione di centro che si terr a chianciano terme si dall11 al 14 settembre
9159473 il presidente pierfendinando casini sa di poter trovare nei giovani una locomotiva di entusiasmo e grinta per rinnovare dal basso questa nostra italia
9159474 non certamente casuale la citt sta divenendo sempre pi il capoluogo di tendenza della valdichiana oltre ai numerosi vip che la rendono trendy la citt sta diventando un must anche per i politici italiani indipendentemente dallo schieramento politico naturale quindi che i giovani abbiano scelto una localit cool per mettersi alla prova in vista dellimpegno che li vedr protagonisti a chianciano
9159475 sar un presidente ha detto che guarda al futuro e non al passato ma ricordatevi queste elezioni non sono su di me ma riguardano voi tutti
9159476 no a ingresso nel pdl con pd dialogo e non intese
9159477 se lofferta quella di entrare nel pdl noi rispondiamo di no perch ci saremmo gi entrati qualche mese prima delle elezioni e con veltroni dialogo in parlamento punto e basta senza equivoci di natura politica
9159478 e comunque facile prevedere precisa che nella gran parte dei casi sar fisiologico una conferma delle alleanze locali con le forze di centrodestra con le quali c un rapporto che dura da pi di 10 anni
9159479 proprio per questo dice cesa teniamo una posizione distinta dal partito democratico evitando di sovrapporre la collaborazione istituzionale tra le forze dellopposizione con lintese politiche che non ci sono
9159480 rafforzare unarea autonoma e centrale della politica italiana larea occupata finora dalludc e che attraverso la fase costituente si allargher a nuovi soggetti
9159481 quando il governo ci ha prospettato in parlamento alcune questioni che noi ritenevamo utili agli italiani sottolinea cesa abbiamo tenuto un atteggiamento positivo quando invece si trattato di opporci come e accaduto per il dpef abbiamo assunto una posizione critica
9159482 una riforma organica che non sia rivolta contro qualcuno ma guardi agli interessi dei cittadini
9159483 no a ingresso nel pdl con pd dialogo e non intese
9159484 no allingresso nel pdl e con il pd dialogo in parlamento
9159485 rafforzare unarea autonoma e centrale della politica italiana larea occupata finora dalludc e che attraverso la fase costituente si allargher a nuovi soggetti
9159486 sar un presidente ha detto che guarda al futuro e non al passato ma ricordatevi queste elezioni non sono su di me ma riguardano voi tutti
9159487 vista la grande enfasi e nello stesso tempo linconsistenza dei fatti a me attribuiti da panorama dice lex presidente del consiglio che parla subito dopo lintervento in proposito del premier silvio berlusconi non vorrei che lartificiale creazione di questo caso politico alimentasse il tentativo o la tentazione di dare vita nel tempo pi breve possibile ad una legge sulle intercettazioni telefoniche che possa sottrarre alla magistratura uno strumento che in molti casi si dimostrato indispensabile per portare in luce azioni o accadimenti utili allo svolgimento delle funzioni che le sono proprie da parte mia conclude prodi non ho alcuna contrariet al fatto che tutte le mie telefonate siano rese pubbliche
9159488 la pubblicazione di intercettazioni telefoniche riguardanti romano prodi a cui va la mia assoluta solidariet non che lennesima ripetizione di un copione gi visto e grave che ci accada e il parlamento deve sollecitamente intervenire per evitare il perpetuarsi di tali abusi che tanto profondamente incidono sulla vita dei cittadini e sulle libert fondamentali
9159489 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9159490 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9159491 marted scorso sono venuto ad arezzo con lunica premura di aver invitato tutti i membri del comitato provinciale uscente per ringraziarli del lavoro svolto durante le elezioni ai presenti ho illustrato il programma dibattuto nellultima direzione nazionale udc
9159492 la linea politica del partito prosegue quella del segretario cesa e di pier ferdinando casini che ci pone alternativi alla sinistra e non annessi al pdl sicuri di esser la spina dorsale del partito popolare europeo in italia il mio compito come commissario quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale affinch gli organi dinformazione possano porre lattenzione su di unazione politica importante senza dar adito a polemiche strumentali che interessano solo chi le alimenta
9159493 in tal senso spiega abbiamo gi attivato nelle maggiori citt della provincia lapertura dei gazebo per la raccolta delle firme per la reintroduzione del voto di preferenza nella legge elettorale avremo poi la festa nazionale di chianciano terme 11 14 settembre p v che ci vedr protagonisti vista la vicinanza geografica dopodich avvieremo una seria verifica con gli iscritti al fine di giungere alle scadenze elettorali 2009 con una definita compagine politico amministrativa
9159494 non possiamo dunque accettare che qualcuno parli sin dora di alleanze con chicchessia chiarisce pur senza dimenticare che la nostra storia ci vede da sempre in provincia di arezzo alternativi alla sinistra in qualsivoglia amministrazione
9159495 ludc valuta positivamente le aperture che ci vengono a livello locale e regionale dagli esponenti del centro destra ma al di l di quelle non vi sono stati ancora incontri ufficiali giudico prematuro e fuorviante parlare di alleanze politiche in questo momento chi ha voglia di impegnarsi nelludc ha la possibilit di farlo sia nel partito sia nelle amministrazioni locali alla ricerca del bene comune e dellinteresse generale
9159496 as in other countries the primary caregivers of small children in afghanistan are their mothers however in this country mothers are subject to a number of restrictions in the decision making process regarding child healthcare
9159497 the poor economic and educational status of these women and their overall immaturity caused by a lack of learning opportunities may have resulted in difficulties in preventing illness in their children
9159498 culturally appropriate programmes with multifaceted approaches that provide families and communities with education and reproductive health services can help stop child marriage
9159499 current country wide efforts to ensure that all women have access to formal education the elimination of poverty and the improvement of sanitary conditions should be further enforced

9159502 with winboxs innovative solutions we can extend the premium online experience to the tv further delivering on the cinemanow mission to empower consumers to enjoy digital entertainment anytime and anywhere
9159503 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9159504 e necessario che anche la regione toscana nella sua veste di soggetto istituzionale coinvolto nellapprovazione del progetto della terza corsia autostradale faccia completamente la sua parte per quanto attiene la verifica delle modalit di realizzazione sia della nuova galleria del melarancio nel tratto fra certosa e scandicci che dellintero tratto autostradale in fase di realizzazione attorno a firenze
9159505 gli interessi in gioco non sono infatti di rilevanza esclusivamente locale afferma ma riguardano lintera viabilit a livello regionale e addirittura nazionale se infatti la tempistica dei lavori e la stessa fattibilit del progetto divenissero incerti si rischierebbe veramente di tagliare in due il paese e di arrecare danni incalcolabili alleconomia dellintera area fiorentina e a quella regionale

9159526 svendita ad air france che il governo prodi intendeva realizzare
9159527 creare una alitalia nuova una compagnia aerea pi efficiente finanziariamente in equilibrio tecnologicamente avanzata
9159528 almeno allinizio ci sono da fare dei sacrifici perch le passate gestioni dellalitalia non possono essere cancellate con un colpo di bacchetta magica
9159529 si deve procedere a un ridimensionamento del personale il cui numero attuale non compatibile con una gestione economicamente sana dellazienda
9159530 il personale in eccedenza si trover in una situazione su cui riteniamo di dovere noi intervenire non sar certo abbandonato perch non giusto che siano i singoli a pagare gli errori delle gestioni del passato e non saranno abbandonati neppure i piccoli risparmiatori che in alitalia hanno creduto investendo in titoli azionari ed obbligazionari della compagnia
9159531 se la nuova compagnia aerea dovesse ritenere utile allearsi con una compagnia straniera questa potr entrare solo come socio di minoranza
9159532 in condizioni meno favorevoli per litalia per i lavoratori i consumatori e gli azionisti
9159533 e facile fare i miracoli con i soldi degli italiani scaricando il buco dellalitalia sulle spalle dei cittadini
9159534 per valutare limpatto che il nuovo piano di ristrutturazione di alitalia avr sulla citt di roma
9159535 c un insieme di strumenti legislativi ammortizzatori sociali in gestione al ministero del lavoro che sono pi che sufficienti a risolvere il problema
9159536 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9159537 un provvedimento serio e condivisibile perch in italia esiste una vera e propria emergenza educativa a cui la scuola non pu sottrarsi
9159538 ludc ha sempre creduto fina dalla scorsa legislatura nella necessit di reintrodurre il voto in condotta e di riportare nelle aule scolastiche lo studio delleducazione civica quindi non possiamo che essere soddisfatti cera bisogno da parte del governo di un segnale forte ed arrivato conclude ciocchetti adesso spetta ai docenti rendere efficaci le nuove disposizioni
9159539 the bjp is willing to consider any effective mechanism for fast track disposal of cases involving major economic offences and corruption cases against politicians and civil servants
9159540 politics for many of its practitioners has become commerce because of corruption in high places the poison has spread in many parts of the governance structure
9159541 criminals tend to feel safe and beyond the pale of law
9159542 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9159543 ne uccidi uno ne salvi mille in questo crediamo e questo facciamo

9159549 chi la ragazza del nostro liceo che quando si arrabbia diventa ancora pi carina

9159551 prima di te bella la mia vita era una notte senza luna molto buia ma con qualche stella punti di luce e razionalit poi hai attraversato il cielo come una meteora allimprovviso tutto ha preso fuoco cera luce cera bellezza quando sei sparita la meteora scomparsa dietro lorizzonte e il buio tornato non era cambiato nulla ma i miei occhi sono rimasti accecati non vedevo pi le stelle niente aveva pi senso

9159553 youre going to see a lot of people who are extremely skeptical it would seem that you would need a little more time
9159554 a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
9159555 to see if anything can be done to keep them here
9159556 the new building is a significant piece of the downtown bellflower revitalization plan currently in place
9159557 starbucks as well as all of our other businesses in the city are extremely important to the city of bellflower our hope is that we can negotiate the current lease with starbucks to keep them in downtown bellflower for our residents and visitors to enjoy
9159558 not believed to provide acceptable returns in the foreseeable future
9159559 it looks to me like its good corporate fat trimming
9159560 when youre at a very accelerated growth youre bound to overshoot a little bit and i think this is cleaning up some of the over spray

9159562 and it may be an unfortunate side effect of their belt trimming that they may not be able to have that largesse in taking in locations that are not proven

9159670 i was wounded on 28 may 1992 in my house which is in the centre of the city close to the presidency that was the night when the intelligence agencies caught a conversation between ratko mladic and one of his soldiers in which he orders his soldiers to burn part of the city and my house happened to be in this part of the city i was wounded taken to the hospital and stayed there for a month the bosnian serbs used a rocket launcher and shot with it through the city thirty six rockets were fired and one of these rockets fell in our apartment the previous day was the first massacre when people queueing for bread were shot at many were killed and injured the night i was injured there were many people like me and i was lying on a bed in the corridor of the hospital as there was no place in the rooms later i was transferred to a room with 48 other wounded people
9159671 the night i was admitted to hospital an elderly woman was admitted too she was wounded much worse than i the doctors were discussing in front of me what to do with the scarce resources they had whether to treat me first or her they decided to treat me first because i was young and had better chances of survival later in the night the older woman with whom i shared a bed as there were not enough beds died i spent the night in a bed drenched in blood next to a dead body i stayed in the hospital over a month to have my leg treated all the treatment was without anaesthesia
9159672 i believe in justice and i hope that his trial will allow us to learn something more about the reasons for the war and everything that happened in bosnia and herzegovina at the same time i am very suspicious that it can really bring us closure the war lasted so long nobody really helped the people during this period we waited so long for the arrest of karadzic and mladic is still free but the wounds not only those that we carry but the wounds are everywhere and this country is so fragile and i am not sure how much bright future we can have in this country as it is now so i am not sure that it will bring what we hoped for we were idealistic hoping that when karadzic and mladic are arrested that a new life will start for us this will not happen but we can at least hope that we can watch him in the trial and learn the truth about the many things that happened around us
9159673 people in the country realize that all the perpetrators will never face a trial like the man that shot me in the leg i will never learn who he was and what happened to him even though i would like to know i am following trials in the war crimes chambers on a daily basis and it is of huge importance the hague is very important but having the possibility to have the trials in the country where the crimes were perpetrated is very important for all of us it is a very important message not only for the people in bosnia but for the people in the whole world that it can be done it is still the whole process and the prosecution and the courts are still weak but they are getting stronger i hope that they will be stronger and able to deal with the most sensitive cases and the most important people who have committed war crimes this week 29 july the war crimes chamber pronounced the first genocide verdict in bosnia and herzegovina it was a verdict in the trial of 11 people who were accused of genocide committed after the fall of srebrenica seven of them were found guilty and they were sentenced to 42 years in prison
9159674 at this moment on state level the justice system is still not completely state owned because we still have international judges and prosecutors and the courts still depend on international donations it has to be a bosnia thing because it will demonstrate that this state wants to deal with war crimes on a local level much more is needed on a local level the system is underdeveloped the prosecution does not have enough capacity the courts do not have enough capacity they still do not have the possibility to offer witness protection much more has to be done on a local level than on a state level even though the state judiciary have to fight much more for their independence and the messages they are sending about the willingness to face the fathoms of the past

9159677 there can be no distributive justice where no one distributes justice has meaning only as a rule of human conduct and no conceivable rules for the conduct of individuals supplying each other with goods and services in a market economy would produce a distribution which could be meaningfully described as just or unjust individuals might conduct themselves as justly as possible but as the results for separate individuals would be neither intended nor foreseeable by others the resulting state of affairs could neither be called just nor unjust
9159678 perhaps the precise outcomes of the process are not foreseeable
9159679 but we can easily foresee that certain things will likely occur like the occasional occurrence of instances of extreme need even if as a society we think ourselves justified in playing the game of catallaxy as hayek puts it on page 60 and later throughout the essay we nevertheless might be able to point to certain predictable and regrettable outcomes of that game and demand that they be cleaned up its on those grounds that i claim that we have some sort of obligation to ensure that no one is left behind by our playing the game of catallaxy i cannot articulate necessarily exactly what that obligation entails or what is its nature but to deny the existence of any such obligation seems simply wrong

9159810 ive heard that this has been the main subject in the papers and ive heard that they showed it on the tv i even heard that shes here so its kind of strange because i would be the first to know probably
9159811 it was a bit embarrassing a few people sat where we usually sit so i had to walk out while claire went and asked them to move i was too embarrassed to ask myself but they were very nice about it obviously didnt work though
9159812 i schedule my life around my life not his life i was gone for dinner and he decided to do it quick i was expecting five sets i was there for four and five but he wasnt there anymore so that was the problem
9159813 it was a good open game both teams put a lot of work into it and we congratulate zenit on their victory
9159814 i cant tell you because ive been with the team
9159815 data from an air force reconnaissance aircraft indicate that gustav continues to rapidly strengthen and now has maximum winds 115 miles per hour 185 kilometres per hour with higher gusts
9159816 this is an innovative way to tackle obesity concerns are high about this issue in young people and if we are successful with this pilot scheme it will carry on and could expand to other areas of suffolk
9159817 one of our major roles is to improve the health and wellbeing of the population
9159818 wherever possible we will encourage people to cut their risk of contracting preventable illness by taking steps such as maintaining a healthy weight
9159819 we welcome initiatives which encourage people of all ages to think about their health and do something positive to improve it such as taking more exercise and finding out more about nutrition
9159820 the biggest problem has always been the lack of budget we all have plans but it you dont have the budget nothing comes out of these
9159821 the solution is for us to have the proper budget
9159822 but whats happening is that we get the five percent of only whats left after the franchise tax is removed and the 50 percent of the gross goes to the national treasury
9159823 if we get all these then sports officials will find no other reason to give if we fail
9159824 if this amendment is passed then we double the psc budget to at least a billion pesos a year then we can double everything from the international exposure and training to equipment and infrastructure
9159825 coaches should pursue masteral courses so they can also become coaches who can research for the improvement of certain sport
9159826 i will save this money and put up a computer business
9159827 extra funding from the department of health will mean more dentists and more appointments meaning that more people in suffolk will be able to see a nhs dentist
9159828 we have tried very hard to make the spread of increased availability fair across suffolk where it is needed
9159829 improving access to nhs dentists is an nhs east of england priority and a priority for nhs suffolk too
9159830 we are currently talking with dentists across suffolk many of whom are keen to expand and take on more nhs patients and hope to see improvements as early as october this year
9159831 for example we are looking into the feasibility of a mobile dentist service to improve access for smaller rural communities
9159832 we have got what we asked for in the coastal area and the west of the county but we will probably be saying it is not enough
9159833 they nhs suffolk were not providing adequate dentistry in those areas so they came to us with the paper six months ago and showed us where dentistry was and where they thought the short falls were and said they had not got any further suffolk homes
9159834 it was very intrusive so i went out onto the croft in my pyjamas i went out into town and got as far as the victory hall
9159835 i concluded it was an old air conditioning unit which had been left on overnight it could have been coming from one of the big offices but it was certainly a mechanical sound
9159836 i was walking down brandon lane when i heard the noise so i followed it
9159837 i wanted to get to the bottom of this i found it was coming from the scaffolding pipes on the tarantella hotel
9159838 you can only hear it when the wind blows and it is something like the sound when you blow across the top of a bottle
9159839 we need more concrete evidence and until we hear it and pinpoint it we have got nothing to go on
9159840 we have scoured half of sudbury and come up with nothing we have been there at different times and in different places with staff of different ages because that does affect hearing and we have not heard anything
9159841 different people have described different things but we are open to suggestions there are lots of theories
9159842 the wind can be an important factor but my suspicion is that the sound carries further on still days
9159843 jonathan was kind generous and thoughtful whose family and partner meant more to him than anything else
9159844 he was very brave and had the best of british qualities he was very strong stoical and honest even though stubborn could have been his middle name he would never complain or moan about what he was going through and i was very proud to call him my son
9159845 i think his disability and the way he coped with it was what made him special he will be greatly missed by his family and all those who knew him
9159846 they would fight like anyone else but they were most certainly each others rock and complimented each other very well it was lovely that both of them had each other
9159847 i would like to thank local people who stopped and helped jonathan when he suffered epileptic attacks while out in the town
9159848 it means so much when people do not just walk on by surely one of the advantages of living in a small town like sudbury we would also like to thank the staff at the bradbury courtyard whose value to someone like jonathan cannot be underestimated
9159849 the town centre already offers excellent shopping business and transport links and this plan will take that to a new level
9159850 the plan sets out a strategy to drive development and improvement leading to an exciting period of change
9159851 it also aims to drive sustainable growth where economic prosperity can be achieved alongside social inclusion and environmental responsibility
9159852 it has been prepared in full consultation with the local community and stakeholders over nearly two years and will support the town centre as the council strives to achieve its vision for the future of the borough
9159853 i know i speak for all three of us when i say we are really grateful for the care we received as we know we could never have afforded to pay for these operations
9159854 we are thankful to have such a great health service to fall back on in our time of need i think everyone was surprised at how quickly we got back to work as we all do such physical jobs
9159855 we had a lot of assistance from the trusts occupational health department which helped us phase our returns and gave us lots of advice
9159856 we believe that with the right care from employers many people could get back to work after knee replacement ops
9159857 we are all unison the health service union members and long service staff and we wanted to tell our story in this 60th anniversary year of the nhs it is the best health service in the world and we should celebrate and protect it
9159858 there was a large police presence when we were told that all zoom staff had gone home
9159859 another company had to sort our luggage out for us for which we were very grateful
9159860 the upshot of this was that we were left with no alternative flights that would have got us into penticton where the event is being held
9159861 i am now back home in bury and pretty down hearted after all the training preparation media coverage and fundraising that has all been part of this project
9159862 i will soon be in negotiation with the race director for a place at ultraman 2009
9159863 i would like to thank everyone who has put in such hard work and so much time to help raise the profile of my project i will not give up and will be back in training to compete next year
9159864 we deeply regret the fact that we have been forced to suspend all zoom operations it is a tragic day for our passengers and more than 600 staff suffolk homes
9159865 if we do get a round of budgetary cuts in the next few months the one thing that is not going to be reduced we hope is this scheme and that is why this petition is so timely
9159866 the petition is brilliant and at the end of the day we need something to happen quickly with the a11
9159867 i would like to offer my most sincere apologies for todays problems which we realise will cause inconvenience to many of our loyal readers and to those colleagues who sell and deliver our newspapers
9159868 unfortunately we have experienced extremely serious problems on our press during the night and this has had a knock on effect
9159869 once again i would like to apologise for the inconvenience caused and i can assure our readers that we are doing all we possibly can to get their favourite newspaper to them suffolk homes
9159870 following the discovery of a mans body at a flat in military road colchester at around 2am this morning two people have now been arrested
9159871 police arrested the two people on suspicion of murder at premises in the old heath area of the town at around 10 30am
9159872 the 34 year old man of no fixed address and a 33 year old woman from colchester will be questioned by detectives
9159873 i saw him only yesterday evening at about 6pm he was a regular customer
9159874 we have had lots of people coming in and asking whats going on but we dont know
9159875 i came out at about 6 30am and they blocked me and told me i wasnt allowed out as there was a problem
9159876 i just had to stay in before they finally let me out at about half eleven
9159877 we are aware that one of our players is being questioned by police following an incident earlier today the club has no further comment to make regarding this matter at this time
9159878 if you look at the two games weve launched at greenhouse besides penny arcade theyre really indie
9159879 i signed a three year contact with ipswich after finishing my gcses and played five competitive matches with the team as centre half i also had periods on loan to stockport county and wycombe wanderers but by then an ongoing tendonitis injury to my knee was affecting my fitness
9159880 in the summer of 2007 at the age of 20 i made the decision to retire from professional football and set my sights on gaining a place at university and pursuing a career with different challenges
9159881 i was keen to continue my interest in sport and wanted to keep my options open so also chose as english language literature law and sociology
9159882 after four years away from education it took time to get used to studying again but i am really enjoying the subjects and the tutors and lecturers are great very supportive
9159883 next year ill complete my a levels and hope to build on my achievements so far after college i plan to study for a degree in history or sociology and may eventually make a career in teaching
9159884 well be looking out onto a two metre metal fence instead of the estuary its having a huge impact already and in my view has made the road more dangerous lorries have got much less space to move along because of the fence
9159885 the view has been unchanged for 200 years and is one of the great views of east anglia but it has completely changed overnight its mindless
9159886 you dont want intense gameplay so thats not what it gives you

9159908 youre going to see a lot of people who are extremely skeptical it would seem that you would need a little more time
9159909 a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
9159910 i the prime minister have come to office in the righteous way and i wont resign
9159911 i will not back down i will rule this country and will lead it through all of the problems
9159912 the coalition partners have the impression that the situation is deteriorating and we are thinking of telling the prime minister to decide on the future of the government
9159913 they want bloodshed in the country they want the military to come out and do the coup again
9159914 the number of female alcoholics has risen from 65 000 to about 100 000 and the number of male alcoholics has risen from about 135 000 to about 165 000 one important reason is that it has become easier and cheaper to buy alcohol

9159920 weve got our work cut out this coming 12 months will be the most difficult 12 months the labour party has had in a generation quite frankly
9159921 weve got to rediscover that zeal which won three elections and that is a huge problem for us at the moment people are pissed off with us
9159922 however the analysis is still ongoing and no decisions have yet been made
9159923 its my belief given the improvement in the security situation in iraq that there will be a continued withdrawal of u s forces as promised by gen petraeus at his last congressional hearing later this fall
9159924 my sense is that i will be able to make a recommendation at that time for some further reductions
9159925 but i do believe there will be certain assets that as we are already looking at the picture right now well be able to recommend can be either redeployed or not deployed to the theater in the fall
9159926 our bowlers bowled well and we fielded well also but we didnt bat well
9159927 once we lost five wickets quickly it was very difficult to come back

9159955 i have withdrawn my papers in line with the partys decision that asif ali zardari will contest as the presidential candidate
9159956 but now all of a sudden now that siddiqui has been put up as a candidate they are launching a character assassination campaign against him which i think is very undemocratic
9159957 if we were to launch a similar campaign we could do it on a much larger scale but we have shown restraint because we dont want to go back to the politics of the 1980s and 1990s
9159958 because he happens to be the co chairman of the ppp
9159959 either zardari must tell the nation that he will resign from the basic membership of the party if he is elected as president or then the presidency will be seen as the ppps presidency rather than being seen as representing the unity of the federation
