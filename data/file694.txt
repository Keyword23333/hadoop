6940000 a tiny portion of america is casting half an eye towards us every now and then maybe we hope
6940001 all in favor of having the presumptive nominee be the actual nominee say more pork sausage please okay its unanimous sally could you bring everybody their own carafe of syrup and drop the check at microsoft at amp t and gms table over there in the corner thats a darling
6940002 we the people are responsible and accountable for what does or does not happen in washington and the fact is is too many american families are following the bad example of the federal government theyre spending more money than they make theyre charging their credit cards taking out home equity loans mortgaging their future
6940003 call last week for americans to break their addiction to oil
6940004 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him
6940005 the most inexperienced ticket in the history of the world
6940006 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
6940007 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
6940008 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
6940009 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
6940010 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
6940011 i try to buy businesses that are so good an idiot could run them because someday one will

6940017 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
6940018 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
6940019 perhaps real world climate sensitivity is very much below the ipccs estimates perhaps therefore there is no climate crisis at all the correct policy approach to a non problem is to have the courage to do nothing
6940020 i was impressed by an hour long academic lecture which criticized claims about global warming and explained the implications of the physics of radiative transfer for climate change
6940021 to me the value of this paper lies in its dispassionate but ruthlessly clear exposition or rather expos of the ipccs method of evaluating climate sensitivity the detailed arguments in this paper and indeed in a large number of other scientific papers point up extensive errors including numerous projection errors of climate models as well as misleading statements by the ipcc consequently there are no rational grounds for believing either the ipcc or any other claims of dangerous anthropogenic global warming
6940022 was 0 3 f cooler than the 1901 2000 average
6940023 its not ice melt but rather wind circulation that drives ocean currents northward from the tropics climate models until now have not properly accounted for the winds effects on ocean circulation so researchers have compensated by over emphasizing the role of man made warming on polar ice melt
6940024 i will make a commitment that al gore will be at the table and play a central part in us figuring out how we solve this problem hes somebody i talk to on a regular basis im already consulting with him in terms of these issues but climate change is real
6940025 possible to kill more flies with honey than with vinegar
6940026 which begs the question if his own wife doesnt trust him with her money why should we trust him with ours
6940027 ahhh im not sure i got to concentrate here on my work
6940028 he said all we have to do is find a really rich country like switzerland and marry it
6940029 all of boston is to be placed under house arrest for four days later this month luciannes rhyming readers have responded with their own verses a sample

6940031 hes basically a skirt chaser folks hes a gigolo well there arent too many of these companies that have little heiresses running around that are single have 500 million that some guy can marry into
6940032 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
6940033 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
6940034 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
6940035 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
6940036 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
6940037 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
6940038 every single one of those quotations came from the campaign of 1960 when the republicans attacked john fitzgerald kennedy
6940039 has a habit of straying off message and making impolitic comments
6940040 pretty deep knowledge of pretty much every big foreign policy question
6940041 obama has shown himself more not less in need of an attack dog able to engage mccain on national security
6940042 e vents in georgia and pakistan have made the prospect that obama will choose
6940043 if obama wanted to make a truly big statement before the convention he might want to risk alienating democrats by picking a republican running mate
6940044 than by choosing a member of the other to be his running mate
6940045 fill the bill of the excitement of the newcomer on the national stage
6940046 p ick a running mate who is a conservative white guy or a general or a republican
6940047 obama is likely to choose someone relatively safe and avoid taking a chance with a game changing selection
6940048 someone who would fill perceived holes in his r sum
6940049 who would reinforce his promise of change or one who might help him win a contested state
6940050 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
6940051 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure
6940052 hang on one goldurned minute this aint gold at all its just gold coloured
6940053 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
6940054 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
6940055 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
6940056 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
6940057 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
6940058 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
6940059 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
6940060 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
6940061 peter please im an x man i dont shoot people im just trying to make a point
6940062 we need a senator who is going to start addressing the issues now republican christine odonnell charged in a telephone interview that was followed by a news conference in dover
6940063 hes using the people of delaware and this senate career as a fallback to his aspirations to another career the situation is too critical for that
6940064 in this election i should be debating my real competition for this job odonnell said
6940065 and the people of delaware should get the opportunity to cast a vote for the person who is going to fulfill their term hes taken delawareans for granted and using the senate as a placeholder
6940066 whether people agree with my positions or not they should be outraged she said
6940067 this is precisely why our country and our state is in the situation it is
6940068 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
6940069 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
6940070 obviamente la pregunta m s importante es si esa persona el candidato a vicepresidente est preparada para ser presidente
6940071 puede esta persona ayudarme a gobernar ser un socio eficaz para crear el tipo de oportunidad econ mica aqu a nivel interno y para guiarnos a trav s de algunas aguas peligrosas a nivel internacional
6940072 quiero alguien que sea capaz de desafiar mis pensamientos y no una persona que a todo diga s
6940073 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
6940074 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
6940075 to resign on the day of the service for walter lippmann
6940076 he seemed perfectly decent and reasonable during the negotiations it has been a disquieting experience for me it has really made me lose my faith in my judgment of people
6940077 peretz used to look like a jewish psychoanalyst now he looks like a jewish used car salesman page 783
6940078 when i first heard that he was after the new republic i wrote gil saying that if he ever got hold of it he would destroy it
6940079 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6940080 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6940081 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
6940082 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
6940083 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
6940084 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
6940085 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
6940086 auster moves from the personal to the political august brill a retired book critic and widower lies in bed recovering from a car accident and conjures an alternate reality in which al gore won the 2000 election and sept 11 and the iraq war never happened instead theres a civil war its an intriguing idea and the brooklyn resident who is also a screenwriter translator and occasional song lyricist will read from the work at politics amp prose on thursday express man in the dark
6940087 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
6940088 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
6940089 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
6940090 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
6940091 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
6940092 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
6940093 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
6940094 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
6940095 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
6940096 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
6940097 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
6940098 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
6940099 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
6940100 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6940101 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6940102 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6940103 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
6940104 ive seen the auditor generals report and the rural communities impact statement
6940105 were considering both those documents but im not impressed at this stage
6940106 in fact the auditor general is recommending that this issue be held over until such time as the national emissions trading scheme details are known
6940107 so this urgency from morris iemma simply doesnt stack up
6940108 morris iemma is spinning as many positives as he can find to justify this policy
6940109 what its really about though is his own political neck hes desperate to save himself
6940110 the people he ought to be listening to really are the community whose really concerned by this proposal
6940111 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
6940112 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
6940113 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
6940114 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
6940115 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6940116 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6940117 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
6940118 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
6940119 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
6940120 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
6940121 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
6940122 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
6940123 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
6940124 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
6940125 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6940126 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6940127 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6940128 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6940129 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
6940130 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
6940131 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
6940132 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
6940133 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
6940134 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6940135 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6940136 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
6940137 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6940138 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
6940139 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
6940140 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
6940141 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
6940142 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
6940143 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
6940144 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
6940145 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
6940146 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
6940147 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
6940148 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
6940149 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
6940150 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
6940151 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6940152 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6940153 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6940154 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6940155 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6940156 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6940157 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
6940158 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
6940159 trust me i have the inside dope that obvious thing that everyone already knows is true
6940160 i cant believe i actually miss jonah goldberg in tnr
6940161 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
6940162 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
6940163 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
6940164 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
6940165 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
6940166 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
6940167 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
6940168 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
6940169 people got used to hearing something cool on a commercial and being like what band is this
6940170 if theyre out there really doing it if theyre playing at the echo then theyre not just being informed by how do i make this for a commercial theyre informed by their whole experience therefore you deliver something authentic
6940171 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
6940172 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
6940173 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
6940174 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
6940175 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
6940176 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
6940177 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
6940178 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
6940179 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6940180 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
6940181 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
6940182 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
6940183 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
6940184 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
6940185 oh weve got more important things we have to do
6940186 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
6940187 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
6940188 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
6940189 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
6940190 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
6940191 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6940192 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6940193 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6940194 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6940195 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6940196 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6940197 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6940198 i think it helps but it doesnt guarantee hes going to win the state
6940199 it may be more useful that evan bayh is on the ticket in other parts of the country he may be more useful in an area like florida
6940200 youre picking somebody from next door youre picking somebody from the midwest who presumably has different values than you
6940201 if evan bayh does become vice president of the united states it leaves an opening at junior senator from indiana its an opening that according to state law the governor gets the opportunity to fill
6940202 to argue that putting bayh on the ticket automatically gives obama indiana is incorrect
6940203 i think it makes it more competitive i still think mccain would have a good chance of winning
6940204 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
6940205 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
6940206 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
6940207 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
6940208 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
6940209 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6940210 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6940211 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6940212 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6940213 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6940214 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6940215 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6940216 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
6940217 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
6940218 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
6940219 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
6940220 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
6940221 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
6940222 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
6940223 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
6940224 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
6940225 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
6940226 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
6940227 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6940228 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6940229 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
6940230 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
6940231 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6940232 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6940233 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
6940234 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
6940235 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
6940236 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
6940237 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests

6940260 to be tempted involves no special humiliation for us because we are antecedently humiliated by the presence of sin in our hearts
6940261 the temptation had to carry in itself for jesus an element of suffering and humiliation on our behalf and not merely the exertion of a strenuous will for obedience here again there is a difference between jesus temptations and ours to be tempted involves no special humiliation for us because we are antecedently humiliated by the presence of sin in our hearts to which the solicitation merely has to address itself which was quite different in the case of jesus

6940310 it is only when there is no therapy or the therapy that is available is of doubtful utility that someone can be recruited to research
6940311 every researcher and every institution that does research must be sure to make an accurate diagnosis of a patient to then offer them whatever therapy is available at the institution to give them all their options in terms of treatment anywhere else and then and only then to pursue the possibility of trying something new in a research study

6940376 i thought weve been pretty efficient tonight its exciting to come out in the first half and move the ball like we did theyre a good defense and its good to be playing well against them
6940377 its a good game its a good preseason game to have with our state rival if you will which gives it a little more incentive its still a preseason game but its a fun game to be a part of

6940391 obama will see a significant bump and believe it is reasonable to expect nearly a 15 point bounce out of a convention in this political environment

6940426 the balance were trying to reach is between iraqs stated desire to have a more concrete view of us forces levels out through the years and our desire it be based on conditions on the ground

6940683 im just really glad to be in the mix with that
6940684 forget all the little excuses and just answer one question
6940685 i think its pretty important for this crew as far as looking to take a step up or a step forward
6940686 so far throughout the season i think we have made progression and improved
6940687 obviously we were pretty disappointed as a group how we went in auckland so for us its a good opportunity to prove to ourselves and obviously to everyone else that we have taken a step forward
6940688 im very hopeful we can show that we can do that
6940689 i think thats a good thing theres a lot less baggage amongst this crew at the moment
6940690 we possibly saw that in our first match against the all blacks a 34 19 win a while back and hopefully we can see that over the next few matches
6940691 when someones talking youre getting a lot of eyes directed straight at you and intensity as far as contests at training
6940692 thats a good thing and weve just got the positive mindset to put ourselves under as much pressure as you can at training and to execute under those pressures
6940693 theyre a side that have the world champion tag so theres still an underlying confidence with that
6940694 it wasnt too long back when they secured that amazing 32 30 victory in dunedin
6940695 i think south africa are an extremely proud nation and especially at home we are expecting a significant battle in front of us on saturday
6940696 when you play at even newlands and especially at joburg and pretoria those venues theyre on top of you and its like a cauldron and the crowd can be at times quite hostile
6940697 whereas at kings park absa stadium theres still a massive crowd but they dont feel as though theyre suffocating you

6940699 so now its hopefully time to implant some new ones

6940704 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6940705 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign

6940916 combined with the fact that returning vets are usually older and partnered this is having a devastating effect on relationships
6940917 the man will say i dont even feel like having sex anymore he has been conditioned to not feel emotions and may experience hypervigilance or anxiety when touched emotional detachment is a hallmark of ptsd
6940918 the first time you see the reflection of your changed body whether sitting in a wheel chair or severely disfigured because of facial burns it is shocking people who are not married look down and ask will anyone ever be interested in me if they are married they wonder will my partner still find me sexually attractive facing issues of body image and sexual self esteem are pretty universal
6940919 i knew that i definitely wanted to have more children and i knew that he was not interested in me and so a big red flag to me was well what did i do why does he not want to have sex why does he not want to touch my hand or why is he not asking me to get in the bed am i the only one that is feeling like i want in the bed
6940920 he had dreams that he didnt realize he was having
6940921 he was much more active during these dreams nothing that would keep me up but yes there was a part of him he couldnt control
6940922 this war can result in separate bedrooms and sexless loveless marriages 25 years down the road
6940923 many couples are resilient and their relationships last or may even be strengthened
6940924 one woman sends her husband to the bunker in the basement
6940925 its inadvertently sending a message that he cant handle it
6940926 i was good looking before and im better looking now
6940927 according to my son and other children they were screaming wrong house wrong house but he kept going
6940928 parents have no reason to be concerned about mr baltimore if they knew him the parents who do know him respect him
6940929 see baracks been um talking down to black people on this faith based i want to cut his fucking balls off barack hes talking down to black people
6940930 not that i expect socialists to respect property but still
6940931 a problem with a temperature sensor may not matter at all or it can be very important depending on what other circumstances accompany it
6940932 we will have to see what other issues were present
6940933 clearly the breakdown was important enough for the pilot to halt the maneuver and have it reviewed
6940934 a set of causes probably came together to cause the accident
6940935 what am i doing stuck here in this huge hotel when my children have been moved 30 kilometers 19 miles away i want to be with them
6940936 who do you want to answer the phone at 3 a m
6940937 as long as clinton was a viable candidate in the democratic nomination process many of our members felt a passionate need to return the loyalty she has earned over decades of support
6940938 le feste del pd chiamatele come vi pare ma fatele
6940939 un appuntamento superato il comizio finale spiega ancora orlando serviva per dettare la linea del partito ora la linea la racconti ogni giorno

6940942 withdraw the us troops from iraq by end of 2011
6940943 the combat troops will withdraw from iraqi cities by june 2009 both the parties have agreed on this
6940944 the negotiators job is done now it is up to the leaders
6940945 the balance were trying to reach is between iraqs stated desire to have a more concrete view of us forces levels out through the years and our desire it be based on conditions on the ground
6940946 i am glad the administration has finally shifted to accepting a timetable for the removal of our combat troops from iraq
6940947 there is a provision that says the withdrawal could be done even before 2011 or extended beyond 2011 depending on the security situation
6940948 yesterday after our win against russia i think i finally felt it for the first time
6940949 i got emotional i sat in my own little zone in the locker room and i didnt want anybody to see me tear up so i sat in the back for a little while just thinking about this whole thing all that we went through all the struggles and fights and hard work we had to do to get here
6940950 to have to go up against australia will be a big challenge because they have a lot to prove and they are going to be ready to play
6940951 we have to have our minds right they are going to come out and they are going to be focused we just have to stick to our game plan and make sure we match the intensity
6940952 i think it is going to be a good game
6940953 you wouldnt want to play a team that you would probably run over you want to have a competitive game a game where you work your tail off to get the victory to meet a team like australia with some of the worlds best players it only solidifies the winner as the no 1 team
6940954 you could tell that the team knew it was the last two a day they were in good spirits and were excited at the start during stretching were starting to get a lot of the guys who have been injured back its a big weekend for them to get their legs back
6940955 we knew it was going to be difficult to beat the united states but its always great to play against the u s and leave them out of the race
6940956 its important both because of the sports and political history we have together
6940957 we were well prepared but i didnt expect that many runs
6940958 playing for bronze isnt what we came here for but its what were doing now
6940959 we want to bring home a medal we dont want to leave here empty handed japans thinking the same thing
6940960 i did my job i came out with the game 4 2 and the important part was i shut down their offense
6940961 under normal circumstances i probably would have let him throw 130
6940962 we were in a really good position we just didnt hold them too many mistakes
6940963 today represents a milestone in our nations efforts to remedy the ills of our past
6940964 the lingering consequences of the misdeeds committed against african americans under slavery and jim crow
6940965 were brutalized humiliated dehumanized and subjected to the indignity of being stripped of their names and heritage
6940966 i hope that this is part of the beginning of a dialogue that this country needs to engage in concerning what the effects of slavery and jim crow have been i think we started it and were going to continue
6940967 we hope to set a model for other denominations about how to face this dark tragic part of our history because we believe that only when you repent can you move on
6940968 day 3 moment depending on how you count days this was either our 3rd day of being out of base camp or our 2nd full day on the trail
6940969 by repealing this law we have affirmed the democratic principle that all people come before their government as equals
6940970 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6940971 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6940972 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6940973 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6940974 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6940975 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6940976 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6940977 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6940978 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6940979 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6940980 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6940981 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6940982 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6940983 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6940984 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6940985 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6940986 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6940987 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6940988 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6940989 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6940990 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6940991 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6940992 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6940993 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6940994 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6940995 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6940996 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6940997 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6940998 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6940999 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6941000 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6941001 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6941002 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6941003 who are open to doing something on the production side
6941004 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6941005 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6941006 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6941007 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6941008 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6941009 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6941010 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6941011 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6941012 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6941013 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6941014 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6941015 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6941016 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6941017 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6941018 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6941019 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6941020 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6941021 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6941022 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6941023 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6941024 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6941025 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6941026 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6941027 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6941028 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6941029 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6941030 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6941031 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6941032 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6941033 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6941034 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6941035 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6941036 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6941037 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6941038 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6941039 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6941040 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6941041 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6941042 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6941043 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6941044 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6941045 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6941046 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6941047 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6941048 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6941049 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base

6941054 on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama

6941062 this is the first program of its kind to inspire shoppers diners and commuters to use 1 coins in their normal everyday activities

6941064 but nobody even gets that anymore he didnt even look sick
6941065 i decided part 2 sounds like an orgy of the decades the freemasons sounds along with the glamour and glitter of the video pay homage to not just musical influence but to social influence for racial equality and the expression of cultural identity
6941066 i decided part 2 falls short due to the fact that while images of racial equality and injustices abound toward the beginning they become much more muted as the video progresses

6941131 there was nothing out of the ordinary in our extended family my mother and my stepmother were best of friends even though a polygamous marriage was not the norm the lebanese society even in the 1960s was very open minded
6941132 my fathers first wife was ill and could not look after their five children when he married my mother for the children my mother was a godsend and they addressed her as khaala or maternal aunt and made her feel tremendously appreciated and respected
6941133 its a solution that our faith offers to social problems
6941134 for religious men polygamy essentially protects them from committing adultery adultery in islam is strictly prohibited if a man decides to have a sexual relationship with another woman he has to marry her in countries like saudi arabia where polygamy is legalised adultery or extra marital affair is rare
6941135 in australia one of the benefits of legalising polygamous marriages would be that men would openly talk about their relationships rather than under the garb of secrecy making these relationships formal will also grant the women and children in such relationships certain rights as men would have obligations and responsibilities towards them
6941136 the origin of polygamy dates back to the early days of islam to the battle of uhud when many men were killed men marrying more than one woman was a social welfare measure ensuring that widows and fatherless children were looked after as during those days there was no government social support system
6941137 if we look at the massacres of men in srebernica and bosnia polygamy can be justified on the grounds of providing material and emotional support for the women left behind however polygamy is and was never meant to be an excuse for men to indulge their sexual fantasies some men over the years have abused this right and maintained harems but that doesnt affect the original rule which imposes a restriction of a maximum of four wives to be treated equally
6941138 in australia there is a great deal of hypocrisy the government recognises de facto relationships as legal according to some estimates as many as 75 per cent australians are living in de facto relationships which has become normal and acceptable even married men may be living in de facto relationships and in some cases in more than one de facto relationship these are perfectly legal no fuss there is also a push for homosexual relationships to be legalised but there is an outcry if muslims want to marry more than once
6941139 a polygamous marriage is like any other marriage with trials and tribulations it is not always a burden for women in the current scenario given the rise of hiv and stds in any sexual relationship one must tread with caution
6941140 as australian muslims we recognise that the marriage act 1961 prohibits polygamy and we are not proposing any changes to this law
6941141 there is absolutely no way that the government will be recognising polygamist relationships they are unlawful and they will remain as such under australian law marriage is defined as the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others polygamous marriage necessarily offends this definition
6941142 in the times we live today no man can treat all his wives equally the women in such relationships can never be happy the worst affected are the children

6941164 i am glad the administration has finally shifted to accepting a timetable for the removal of our combat troops from iraq

6941365 and anna said as the lord my god liveth if i beget either male or female i will bring it as a gift to the lord my god and it shall minister to him in holy things all the days of its life
6941366 and the child was two years old and joachim said let us take her up to the temple of the lord that we may pay the vow that we have vowed lest perchance the lord send to us and our offering be not received and anna said let us wait for the third year in order that the child may not seek for father or mother and joachim said so let us wait
6941367 and the priest said to joseph thou hast been chosen by lot to take into thy keeping the virgin of the lord and joseph was afraid and took her into his keeping and joseph said to mary behold i have received thee from the temple of the lord and now i leave thee in my house and go away to build my buildings and i shall come to thee the lord will protect thee
6941368 and the priest said i will give you to drink of the water of the ordeal of the lord and he shall make manifest your sins in your eyes and the priest took the water and gave joseph to drink and sent him away to the hill country and he returned unhurt and he gave to mary also to drink and sent her away to the hill country and she returned unhurt and all the people wondered that sin did not appear in them and the priest said if the lord god has not made manifest your sins neither do i judge you and he sent them away and joseph took mary and went away to his own house rejoicing and glorifying the god of israel
6941369 and the midwife went forth out of the cave and salome met her and she said to her salome salome i have a strange sight to relate to thee a virgin has brought forth a thing which her nature admits not of then said salome as the lord my god liveth unless i thrust in my finger and search the parts i will not believe that a virgin has brought forth and the midwife went in and said to mary show thyself for no small controversy has arisen about thee and salome put in her finger and cried out and said woe is me for mine iniquity and mine unbelief because i have tempted the living god and behold my hand is dropping off as if burned with fire
6941370 whereas therefore the whole church itself is a virgin espoused unto one husband christ as the apostle says of how great honor are its members worthy who guard this even in the flesh itself which the whole church guards in the faith which imitates the mother of her husband and her lord for the church also is both a mother and a virgin for whose purity consult we for if she is not a virgin or whose children address we if she is not a mother mary bare the head of this body after the flesh the church bears the members of that body after the spirit in both virginity hinders not fruitfulness in both fruitfulness takes not away virginity
6941371 her virginity also itself was on this account more pleasing and accepted in that it was not that christ being conceived in her rescued it beforehand from a husband who would violate it himself to preserve it but before he was conceived chose it already dedicated to god as that from which to be born this is shown by the words which mary spoke in answer to the angel announcing to her her conception how says she shall this be seeing i know not a man which assuredly she would not say unless she had before vowed herself unto god as a virgin but because the habits of the israelites as yet refused this she was espoused to a just man who would not take from her by violence but rather guard against violent persons what she had already vowed although even if she had said this only how shall this take place and had not added seeing i know not a man certainly she would not have asked how being a female she should give birth to her promised son if she had married with purpose of sexual intercourse she might have been bidden also to continue a virgin that in her by fitting miracle the son of god should receive the form of a servant but being to be a pattern to holy virgins lest it should be thought that she alone needed to be a virgin who had obtained to conceive a child even without sexual intercourse she dedicated her virginity to god when as yet she knew not what she should conceive in order that the imitation of a heavenly life in an earthly and mortal body should take place of vow not of command through love of choosing not through necessity of doing service thus christ by being born of a virgin who before she knew who was to be born of her had determined to continue a virgin chose rather to approve than to command holy virginity and thus even in the female herself in whom he took the form of a servant he willed that virginity should be free

6941412 when we travel through life attentive to the sacred compass we find that gods direction changes us we discover that spiritual discernment is about sensing the presence and call of god not just about making decisions the process of following the sacred compass awakens us to a life of constant renewal of our hearts minds wills and souls

6941414 shew me thy ways o lord teach me thy paths

6941416 the postmodern world is a world which understands itself through biological rather than mechanistic models a world where people see themselves as belonging to the environment rather than over it or apart from it a world distrustful of institutions hierarchies centralized bureaucracies and male dominated organizations it is a world in which networks and local grassroots activities take precedence over large scale structures and grand designs a world in which the book age is giving way to the screen age a world hungry for spirituality yet dismissive of systematized religion it is a world in which image and reality are so deeply intertwined that it is difficult to draw the line between the two

6941453 i feel we had good game we obviously have some things to work on but overall i was impressed with our play
6941454 i think overall we did a really good job tonight
6941455 it was good to get people some time who have not played much or who were playing for the first time it was nice to see us come so close to getting a result against such a good team
6941456 i felt confident out there tonight and i knew the defense in front of me would do a good job
6941457 kellys goal was awesome i was very excited to see us get on the board first i think it gave the team a lot of confidence and it was a great way to start the season offensively
6941458 offensively there were times where our passing and movement was really dangerous and i thought it flowed very well i think we are certainly capable of doing that more consistently and thats what we will be working towards against unc greensboro sunday

6941595 other seeds fell into the good soil and as they grew up and increased they yielded a crop and produced thirty sixty and a hundredfold

6941713 this isnt what the administration was expecting when they went into the process of negotiating these agreements
6941714 any successful politician in iraq is going to have to run as a nationalist
6941715 the timetables that were being argued in the congress were being argued based upon politics not based upon conditions on the ground
6941716 the president said he never heard any democrats making the argument that
6941717 i am glad that the administration has finally shifted to accepting a timetable for the removal of our combat troops from iraq
6941718 success in iraq depends on an iraqi government that is reconciling its differences and taking responsibility for its future and a timetable is the best way to press the iraqis to do just that
6941719 the fact of the matter is the iraqis demanded some timeline for our departure and the bush administration acceded to their demands
6941720 we should not forget that this is possible only because of the surge a strategy many predicted would fail and that some cannot even today recognize as a stunning success
6941721 if you believe as most iraqis do that theres been a heck of a lot of progress over here what is the next thing theyre going to say
6941722 when are these guys finally leaving so we can get on with our lives
6941723 re ok i have to vent or im gonna screammingggg 1 wait im confused did you tell your friend you had to stop watching
6941724 re re ok i have to vent or im gonna screammingggg 1 im sorry i got you confuse i tell her that i will stop this saturday yes i have to
6941725 i like my game i like the way im playing
6941726 with a couple of exceptions today for not knowing the golf course i felt i did pretty well maneuvering my ball around and to maneuver your ball around a golf course you dont know you have to have control i felt like i did that pretty well
6941727 itd be pretty tough i think but if you are playing well 64 65 seems possible
6941728 i kept looking at the mountains over there and it kept me really relaxed
6941729 it keeps our momentum going even though i dont believe in momentum it sounds good
6941730 its great for the morale and all that but really this sport youre either fast or youre not when you unload the reason were running well right now is that everybody has been working real hard for a long time i dont think it has to do with just the last few weeks
6941731 ive been victim to the momentum stoppers so many times
6941732 in 2005 the whole week theyd been writing about the magical race car driver that won i spun out in qualifying before i even took the flag and wrecked and i went from hero to zero that momentum didnt work
6941733 crew chief bob osborne said unless you get the pole im going to be really ticked off at you for that and it worked out
6941734 i just got real loose you saw a lot of people get loose there the cars have so much power when you come off the corner the car changes so much
6941735 im just glad i didnt wreck it any worse it just got the body so guys pretty much have it patched up if thats all the damage we get in the next 24 36 hours well be all right
6941736 ken might call up and say why dont you take a cup car to talladega

6941738 its a hobby we took from my backyard where the team once was based to winning nationwide races against best in the world it amounts to the equity weve built and what weve been able to deliver to aarons over the last 10 years
6941739 second set at 1 0 i made some double faults maybe i lost a little bit of confidence and gave him some confidence
6941740 but i think i played really good the whole match and i am happy with how i feel and how im playing
6941741 mr president are you aware our flesh and blood is dying over there when the coffins come back do you care when only the poor kids die is it fair dont get me wrong i respect the flag but it hurts to see a kid in a body bag he fought for his country with all he had now we have a family without a dad
6941742 mr president are you aware unless youre rich you have poor health care it makes you scream and want to pull out your hair discharged from the hospital soon as you get there
6941743 tell me how to set that up and i would be there in a heartbeat

6941746 vlm airlines is honoured to receive this prestigious award which is a powerful endorsement of service from the people that really matter passengers we are dedicated to providing the highest levels of service and strive continually to set new standards
6941747 this award is particularly pleasing in that it demonstrates quality of service and service clearly matter to customers on short haul services vlm airlines were strongly supported in this survey category and were frequently singled out for the high standards of staff service they deliver the award is very much a recognition of the those customer facing staff
6941748 we are coming apart at the seams in every sense

6941752 the undercarriage is nude without mudguards the plane can only fly if it doesnt rain we are fine until the end of september but only in the south nothing to put security at risk
6941753 if one is not in line with the norms and dictates alitalia does not take off
6941754 international statistics confirm that alitalia is one of the most secure airlines in the world
6941755 perhaps aviator az does not take into account the delicate situation in which we find ourselves
6941756 the opinion of men who are liable to error are often at variance with those of god

6941772 we did some great things in the first half our movement on and off the ball was outstanding but i thought we got a little complacent in the second half in the final third but we came out and played a team that went to the mac finals last year and basically returned everybody im really pleased that we came out and had such a dominating performance
6941773 obama is against the war in iraq and wants to take troops out asap
6941774 but at the same time they dont because they became attached to the people over there and the poverty that has risen in those nations i would have to think that if you work in one place for so long then it would be hard to leave the people you fought for
6941775 if youre a soldier you see things differently than a civ
6941776 my brother just got back from iraq and he became very attached to some local nationals that he trained to be one of his kind to help build their military and their democracy he was proud to see their progress growth and morale when he left his deployment
6941777 then again the air force is very caring like that im pretty sure thats why our boys are there
6941778 there is no way obama understands u s troops and what they ensure as much as john mccain a man who served with great distinction in combat
6941779 in addition mccain has two sons who serve making his share of the war time burden greater than 99 of americans obama has never served and doesnt have any military training many of his public statements talking about swat teams in baghdad for example demonstrate that he knows little about the military
6941780 senator obamas apparent insistence that u s forces be rapidly withdrawn at all costs and regardless of circumstances is troubling and potentially self defeating if elected president he seems willing to remove u s forces from iraq even if such a decision contradicts the facts on the ground and the best advice of u s commanders
6941781 i put my uniform on everyday knowing that i make a difference
6941782 will go with the mindset to change multiple lives and to lift their morale about the tyranny that was set forth in their nation

6941792 the idea that tax cuts would actually increase revenues turned out to deserve the ridicule
6941793 obama says he would hike several taxes on people making more than 250 000 including the amount they pay on capital gains currently the top income tax rate is 35 percent under obama that would go back up to 39 percent obamas staff told the urban brookings tax policy center he would raise the rates for people in the top two brackets about 2 5 million filers out of 100 million plus people in those high tax brackets would see the tax rate on their capital gains hiked from the current 15 percent to 20 28 percent

6941811 the amount of concern and urgency from the detroit companies has increased in the last month and significantly ratcheted up what theyre communicating what their funding needs are
6941812 i believe we should fund it and take action that will assist detroit and its suppliers in making it through this difficult time of transition
6941813 its a common sense response to the realities on the ground
6941814 we dont see it as a bailout we see it as government assistance to help retooling tied to the production of these advanced technology vehicles
6941815 government policy can be aligned with consumer demand and the efforts of the industry
6941816 congress created a program for direct loans and were hopeful that they can fund those this year
6941817 senator mccain has stubbornly focused on maintaining an indefinite us presence in iraq but events have made his bluster and record increasingly out of touch with reality
6941818 while senator mccain continues to offer unconditional military and economic support for iraq i strongly believe that we need to use our leverage with the iraqi government to ensure a political settlement
6941819 conditions based withdrawals of us troops are the precise opposite course of that advocated by senator obama
6941820 senator obama seeks to withdraw all us combat forces regardless of the consequences for iraq or for american national security
6941821 i am glad the administration has finally shifted to accepting a timetable for the removal of our combat troops from iraq
6941822 success in iraq depends on an iraqi government that is reconciling its differences and taking responsibility for its future and a timetable is the best way to press the iraqis to do just that
6941823 i welcome the growing convergence around this pragmatic and responsible position

6941828 secondly for the first time the leaders of the pacific islands forum have embraced the possibility of suspension of a member state to be adopted against fiji should they continue not to embrace their undertakings for march 2009 elections

6941893 estamos m s que interesados en saber cu l es la situaci n en el sector comercial
6941894 obviamente a ellos le interesa cu l es el estado de las cuentas p blicas porque existe una relaci n entre ambos sectores
6941895 lo que se hizo en la reuni n fue una exposici n de c mo se llev al ejercicio 2008 y c mo ha invertido el municipio los fondos p blicos que son de todos los ciudadanos
6941896 mostramos cu l ha sido el proceso de planificaci n y en este sentido siempre con la premisa del equilibrio fiscal c mo hemos tratado de hacer rendir el dinero para que llegue efectivamente el beneficio al ciudadano
6941897 a su vez hicimos una presentaci n puntual sobre c mo ha sido la evoluci n de los ingresos en el transcurso del a o mostrando que la principal inversi n que hemos tenido es cancelar la deuda del ejercicio 2007 debido al no ingreso del fondo de coparticipaci n que es la principal fuente de ingreso del municipio
6941898 estamos en un contexto donde hay una inflaci n muy marcada los recursos provenientes de coparticipaci n por ingresos brutos o ingresos nacionales llegaron a un techo en mayo y est bajando todos los meses con lo cual estamos muy preocupados porque si este ndice se mantiene se pude llegar a una situaci n complicada a fin de a o
6941899 en relaci n a este punto los comerciantes tambi n manifestaron que la actividad comercial se resinti m s que significativamente en el transcurso del a o
6941900 en mayo hubo una merma de m s de 3 millones de pesos proveniente de coparticipaci n y lo que m s se resinti son los ingresos brutos que son los impuestos que est relacionado directamente con el nivel de consumo

6941910 that a people can be enslaved just as effectually by making property of their lands as by making property of their bodies is a truth that conquerors in all ages have recognized and that as society developed the strong and unscrupulous who desired to live off the labor of others have been prompt to use
6941911 that each particular slave should be owned by a particular master would in fact become as social development went own and industrial organization grew complex a manifest disadvantage to the masters
6941912 unable to employ themselves the nominally free laborers are forced by their competition with each other to pay as rent all their earnings above a bare living or to sell their labor for wages which give but a bare living and as landowners the ex slaveholders are enabled as before to appropriate to themselves the labor or the produce of the labor of their former chattels
6941913 but it may be said that the analogy between our industrial system and chattel slavery is only supported by the consideration of extremes
6941914 these objections will be best met by endeavoring to imagine a well developed society like our own in which chattel slavery exists without distinction of race
6941915 in such a society the indolence interest and necessity of the masters would soon develop a class of intermediaries between the completely enslaved and themselves
6941916 and as has always happened where slavery had not race character some of these ex slaves or their children would in the constant movement be always working their way to the highest places so that in such a state of society

6941935 it is troubling that formerly militant activists united nations agency leaders government health officials the american foreign policy establishment religious leaders scientists and physicians fail to see aids treatment for what it is a stop gap measure
6941936 the slogan of the first 15 years of the pandemic was until there is a cure today it seems the global health leadership of the world is satisfied with until there is lifelong drug therapy for everybody
6941937 even the cancer lobby recognizes the needs for both oncology treatment access
6941938 no leading figure in hiv research has publicly uttered the word cure since the early 1990s most of the multibillion dollar hiv research enterprise focuses on improving the treatment model that is already in place finding new consistently more expensive drugs to add to the existing cocktails
6941939 not able to join in celebrating the creation of a vast multibillion dollar aids treatment industry employing hundreds of thousands of individuals worldwide that serve as a vested lobby on behalf of a prolonged medical approach to a virus that ought to be eliminated entirely from the pantheon of threats to humanity
6941940 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6941941 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign
6941942 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6941943 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6941944 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking

6941951 strike action is a last resort for our members who provide an invaluable service in ensuring the safety of shipping in british waters
6941952 the latest action could have been avoided if the government and the maritime and coastguard agency mca hadnt continued with their refusal to negotiate a satisfactory outcome
6941953 members have rightly grown angry at the scandalous refusal to pay them the same as other emergency service workers and by the governments policy to cap public sector pay increases below inflation

6941961 where hes wrong is that we went into iraq at the invitation of the government not as an invasion
6941962 we were invited by the iraqi government to send our troops to the country in order to depose that very government and install one
6941963 yw snapped his fingers trying to think looking at me for answers

6941965 defence minister anatoly serdyukov has reported to the commander in chief dmitry medvedev on the completion of the order to pull out from georgian territory russian troops sent to reinforce peacekeepers
6941966 the pullout was carried out without any incidents and was completed according to plan at 19 50 moscow time 11 50 a m edt
6941967 russian military columns proceeded to the territory of south ossetia a part of these units is already at its permanent bases on russian territory
6941968 this buffer zone actually refers to agreements from 1999 and 1994 and my view is that it is against the spirit of the so called ceasefire agreement
6941969 my interpretation is that buffer zones should not be built but we will discuss all this during the next few days
6941970 they have a proposal for what they call a phoenix fund which is somewhere between 1 billion and 2 billion dollars
6941971 thats really reconstruction its for infrastructure its not just because of hostilities its for development
6941972 georgia has given us rather a long list of things they would like to see communications is certainly part of it hydro electric dams
6941973 there is a good amount that needs to be done
6941974 it does not all need to be done by the united states it can be done by international organizations as well as other bilateral organizations
6941975 this is usually a very large part of a countrys request
6941976 everyone is talking about the same issue everyone is against the way georgia behaved i also support russia
6941977 we are all the same russia and ukraine and sevastopol are bound so tightly in a knot that it is difficult to untangle it
6941978 as long as the fleet is here there will be no problems i suspect people in the ukrainian government do not understand the meaning of the fleet for sevastopol
6941979 the black sea fleet will be in sevastopol after 2017 and sevastopol will not allow any provocation from the ukrainian government this will serve the interests of ukraine and russia
6941980 the overwhelming majority of people in sevastopol would like to have russian citizenship to be nearer russia and to be protected by the russians
6941981 the sphere of the russian language is getting smaller but if we can have russian citizenship there is a chance of living a normal fulfilling life
6941982 there is no doubt the hardliners are totally in control
6941983 the prospect of a really cozy friendly relationship with europe has gone
6941984 if we end up with a much more belligerent and less cooperative relationship between brussels and moscow then i do believe the plan would be seriously disrupted or delayed
6941985 russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
6941986 it is my understanding that they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
6941987 i saw that announcement we will continue to monitor the situation but we are not seeing that they are in compliance right now
6941988 there has been some movement of forces but whether or not that is an indication of a withdrawal or just a repositioning of forces is a bit difficult to determine at this point but those movements remain minor
6941989 we will turn our attention to providing the assistance that georgia needs to rebuild its infrastructure provide humanitarian relief aid its damaged military and help shore up its currency

6941994 and i knew that it was going to probably lead to one thing or another
6941995 and hes got to make the decision for this club and right now you cant feel good about me going out there after what happened in texas i mean i dont feel good about me going out there after what happened in texas i know i have better stuff than that if i dont have anything to throw off of that fastball then im in trouble
6941996 throughout my career and especially when it comes to situational pitching ive always felt like when ive had my legit slider which is my out pitch ive felt like i could get out of anything
6941997 and this year for whatever reason its just been inconsistent off and on
6941998 i think the biggest thing is getting my stuff back to where it needs to be because its not the same the hit totals and what lefties are doing against me this year pretty much reveal that
6941999 i think the worst thing to do would be to panic and try to go against everything weve tried to do and replace nate with dontrelle
6942000 that would be the easy thing to do but i think it would be the wrong thing to do right now and so does tigers president and general manager dave dombrowski

6942016 el asunto en el que se le involucra al parecer surgi antes que ortega fuese presidente del vecino pa s es posible que eso sea una presunci n
6942017 mientras un tribunal no lo condene l es inocente aunque ese asunto es importante no es posible que el gobierno hondure o rechace su presencia aqu porque no nos toca juzgarlo y hay que recibirlo con todos los honores de un mandatario

6942122 so what we encourage kids is to think about it before you pick up that sip of alcohol
6942123 i dont see the whole point of it because there is no actual sound ordinance so you can get a noise violation anytime even in the day
6942124 i dont really agree with the system they have because weve gotten some indirect noise violations where other people have been called on by the cops and theyve heard we have people over and they walk over our house and give us one
6942125 first time is a warning and the second time is 250 third time 500 and forth time eviction
6942126 the practice is that when you have a positive test you have a reason to recall
6942127 sometimes you do tests that turn out not to be positive
6942128 you have a positive test you have the information that you need once theres a health risk assessment done by health canada we go forward with the recall
6942129 what is really needed in my perspective is a full blown inquiry on what is happening to the food inspection business in this country
6942130 inspecting the products before they make it to the stores before people can actually purchase them those are the audits that arent being made those are the audits that arent being made because theyre too short staffed
6942131 i never lost him i cant see him but i always felt he was there with us

6942139 this movie was so awesome my lungs got all tangled up with my trachea and i died but the awesomeness brought me back to life
6942140 having seen revenge of haunted blood mountain 10 and blood babes of pain 1 7 i expected more out of the partnership of killtarps and snooten brack although the movie doesnt disappoint and the surprise zombie sniper in the final battle scene was a pleasant surprise on the whole there could of been more dismemberments shown in graphic detail and a little less talking and homosexual tension between death squad members a solid 7 10
6942141 heel hook your fucking face off you glorified coffee fetcher do you know who the fuck i am i invented the ufc
6942142 i saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story from the tip of every branch like a fat purple fig a wonderful future beckoned and winked one fig was a husband and a happy home and children and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor and another fig was ee gee the amazing editor and another fig was europe and africa and south america and another fig was constantin and socrates and attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions and another fig was an olympic lady crew champion and beyond and above these figs were many more figs i couldnt quite make out i saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree starving to death just because i couldnt make up my mind which of the figs i would choose i wanted each and every one of them but choosing one meant losing all the rest and as i sat there unable to decide the figs began to wrinkle and go black and one by one they plopped to the ground at my feet

6942160 but evan was cool with this whatever happened he understands what hes got a family and a life hes very happy in
6942161 the timing has nothing to do with the by elections
6942162 its just a coincidence that he came back during the by election

6942166 a record in two parts elephants teeth sinking into heart
6942167 i didnt set out to make a two part album
6942168 we just followed the songs lyrical lead and built them up with textures and sounds that served the story the beautiful ones were darker and worked with lush arrangements we used the sounds of rain tree branches falling on the roof whatever kept the mood true to this haunted studio in the first stormy days of spring the second part became more anthemic like a reclaiming of personal power theres something raw about it to me it sounds weathered but not broken or cynical
6942169 its about being willing to take a risk even if its not going to end up well teeth is like rediscovering your backbone after youve gone through the loss elephants
6942170 the basic falsehood and evil of egoism lie in the fact that ascribing to himself in all justice an absolute significance he unjustly refuses to others this same significance recognizing himself as a center of life which as a matter of fact he is he relegates others to the circumference of his own being and leaves them only an external and relative value
6942171 narcissists appear to be unpleasantly deliberate they are too human or too inhuman or too modest or too haughty or too loving or too cold or too empathic or too strong or too industrious or too casual or too enthusiastic or too indifferent or too courteous or too abrasive
6942172 by the time i met him he is a professor of education at the university of illinois
6942173 on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it
6942174 its pretty clear that hes drawing from people who might ordinarily have gone to franken
6942175 he is competing with franken for the angry voter who disapproves of bush and sees the country as off on the wrong track
6942176 we didnt need a poll to tell us al has tremendous momentum in this race and that minnesotans are responding positively to his message of change all over the state
6942177 is between al franken and norm coleman thats always been our focus
6942178 but the fact that norm coleman continues to have a wide lead among independents and is tied overall in a poll that leans so heavily democratic is very encouraging
6942179 ive only been at this a month ive done no media i just started fundraising im very happy with this i just wish franken would stop stealing all my voters
6942180 the results of this poll should be taken with a grain of salt
6942181 hey he is different looking but not by choice accept him as he is or walk away
6942182 hey he cant breathe i dont like that so let me end his life

6942216 he kept hammering away at the plight of the poor when there was more chance for political loss than gain
6942217 for every two or three days that you waste time making speeches at rallies full of noise and balloons theres usually a chance every two or three days where you get a chance to teach people something and to tell them something that they dont know because they dont have the chance to get around like i do to take them some place vicariously that they havent been to show them a ghetto or an indian reservation
6942218 what he did was not really that mystical all it requires is someone who knows himself and has some courage

6942234 if you could change one thing about school what would that be
6942235 i wouldnt let all the teachers give us all that work to do just before report cards i know that teachers need marks for report cards but its too much when they all give us all that work at the same time its not that i dont want to do homework its just that its too much work at one time thats what id want to change
6942236 have students do homework at school and watch video lessons at home now thats really thinking outside the box
6942237 yes listening to music in the classroom can help students be more productive especially students with adhd type symptoms
6942238 not all students like using the digital technology now what
6942239 once people dont trust a police officer in immigrant communities they become communities that foster crime where people wont report domestic violence or the theft of a tv if people feel they are under threat of being deported they become silent there has to be a delicate balance

6942260 children should be discouraged from putting their laptops on their lap when using wireless internet connections because of potential health risks from emissions a technology expert has warned professor lawrie challis who heads a committee on mobile phone safety said that until more research was conducted children should keep a safe distance from the embedded antennas on wi fi enabled laptops if a wi fi laptop was placed on the lap people could be two centimetres from the transmitter and receiving comparable exposure to that from a mobile phone since we advise that children should be discouraged from using mobile phones we should also discourage children from placing their laptop on their lap when using wi fi

6942271 schools need to do more to protect students from road rage on the digital highway i have computers in my classroom and saw kids using myspace before it was blocked and realized the need for us to teach kids in a systematic way about using the internet safely i have also seen and heard the relational aggression that goes on amongst students i have suggested that schools among other things implement a program that deals with cyber bullying based on the program that all ready exists for bullying i also suggested that students need to know that freedom of speech is limited by the laws prohibiting libel and slander kids and adults need to be absolutely clear on what is appropriate behaviour and what isnt our safe school policy states when using electronic resources students must demonstrate appropriate on line conduct manners and refrain from improper unethical use of technology including computer hacking internet use for any purpose which is contrary to the schools code of conduct is strictly prohibited this includes all forms of violence threats and harassment directed at the students or school this applies to school work and home internet use harassment and physical verbal oral or written sexual or psychological abuse bullying or discrimination on the basis of faith gender socioeconomic status ability age sexual orientation or any other attribute is unacceptable any student who demonstrates behaviour inconsistent with board policy or the school code of conduct will face consequences which may include loss of privileges detention community service making restitution suspension or full expulsion from any school in the province i am very much concerned about the issue of cyber bullying and relational aggression and made suggestions to help stop the abuse and help deal with the abuse with these thoughts and concerns and kathy sierras experience of cyber abuse in my head i read miguels post think before you post where he says for me its a reminder that we all have to be a bit thicker skinned when we venture out into an online world if i post my photo online i have to expect that it will be modified if i share my thoughts my hopes my fears i have to expect that they could be used against me i read the statement and concluded that the victim was being blamed because she should be thicker skinned and not bothered by whatever she should have know better and she should have expected trouble i said that blaming a victim for cyber abuse reminded me of when women were blamed for being raped because they wore short skirts the implication was that the victim was at fault because of what she did and she should have know better and she only had herself to blame for miguels statement about my accusation
6942272 wrong doers to face the victim consider the impact of their behaviour and come up with ways of making amends it holds them accountable for their actions
6942273 its time to implement the restorative justice process to help make schools safer
6942274 the kindergarten teachers initial expectations which are based on family history physical appearance and classroom behaviour rather than academic potential or performance accurately forecasts a childs future academic career

6942277 what elona would do if she ruled the education world

6942284 should i embed videos or link to them in my blog
6942285 should teachers have to pay to plug in the fan in their classrooms
6942286 i have brought you t master it took quite a lot of searching on your galaxys non holographic communications network but no man is beyond the reach of a sith
6942287 why are you such a sheep why is it so hard to believe that the american government or insert your favorite suspect there could do this america isnt perfect people are evil
6942288 uhhh i thought we were talking about the twin towers how did we get into a philosophical discussion on the morality of america and its leaders
6942289 bush and his oil and war industry buddies planned this attack to start a war for profit
6942290 do we believe that secret societies exist and influence the world
6942291 can you be an intellectually honest person and believe that buildings as large as the twin towers and wtc7 could be wired up with explosives over a long period of time and no one notice
6942292 can we believe that every member of this necessarily large and unbelievable talented crew of jason bournes that wired the buildings up are all keeping their silence and never made a mistake
6942293 can we believe that every single one of the government and non government agencies and corporations that studied ground zero and proclaimed there was no evidence of explosives are all in on the conspiracy
6942294 can we believe that even the rank and file those who would have done the analysis of all those agencies are in on it
6942295 can we believe that this conspiracy really does include the literal thousands of people it would have to include
6942296 are we willing to believe these very unlikely scenarios to be true without empirical evidence are we to accept the practical improbabilities to satiate our desire to safeguard our philosophy
6942297 on about a third of the face to the center and to the bottom approximately 10 stories about 25 percent of the depth of the building was scooped out
6942298 what our preliminary analysis has shown is that if you take out just one column on the lower floors it could cause a vertical progression of collapse so that the entire section comes down
6942299 nist has seen no evidence that the collapse of wtc7 was caused by bombs missiles or controlled demolition
6942300 how about a magic trick im going to make this pencil disappear bang tada its ahh its gone
6942301 you remind me of my father i hated my father
6942302 how about a magic trick im going to make this pencil disappear bang tada its ahh its gone
6942303 you remind me of my father i hated my father

6942306 i usually get two tests in a day so five hours is studying for both of them
6942307 i was burdened with a lot of homework both from school and from my private tutor i couldnt finish them so i made the calls
6942308 this is one of those really good ideas that has the potential to do what we really want in society
6942309 it has to do with what we talk to our students about and what kind of models we are for our children as readers
6942310 with 10th graders the parents often really did tell me that it was the one place where they could talk with their student without fighting without arguing about their hair
6942311 in fact no study has found any academic benefit to giving students homework before theyre in high school and even at that point the evidence is dubious that its necessary to make kids work what amounts to a second shift after having spent six or seven hours in school
6942312 people in the business and corporate world are pointing out more and more kids coming out of college lacking a work ethic they lack the ability to hang in there with a task that is demanding and to get something through to completion they have a low tolerance for frustration and expect on any given situation for someone else to solve the problem for them
6942313 paraprofessionals and teachers work together as a team for the benefit of students
6942314 obscured the underlying math and students were not able to transfer their knowledge to new problems
6942315 teaching math using real world examples may not facilitate learning
6942316 he was trouble in grade two what do you expect
6942317 twenty percent of kids sitting in classrooms are mentally ill
6942318 you know all those times i got mad at you called you names and said i didnt care what you did to me
6942319 i asked him if he understood that i already knew that and he did
6942320 making it emotionally expensive for the students to act out by strengthening my connections with them loving the ones who try to make themselves as unlovable as possible teaching the kids to analyze themselves when they feel
6942321 schools need to do more to protect students from road rage on the digital highway
6942322 why dont kids with learning disabilities get to do the cool stuff that gifted kids get to do
6942323 get lost in the activities and lose sight of purpose as well as results activities must be seen as a means to important learning ends and not ends in themselves
6942324 the overpowering stimulation and excitement that virtual reality produces can lull the imagination and numb sympathetic feelings for pain and suffering
6942325 is a conscious willful and deliberate hostile activity intended to harm induce fear through threat of further aggression and create terror
6942326 miss i was only teasing or miss we were just fooling around were really friends
6942327 members have rightly grown angry at the scandalous refusal to pay them the same as other emergency service workers and by the governments policy to cap public sector pay increases below inflation

6942505 one could say that people sometimes have already made up their minds even though they do not know it yet
6942506 political pollsters might learn that there are some questions better left unasked
6942507 to hate injustice and stand on righteousness is a difficult thing furthermore to think that being righteous is the best one can do and to do ones utmost to be righteous will on the contrary bring many mistakes the way is in a higher place than righteousness this is very difficult to discover but it is the highest wisdom when seen from this standpoint things like righteousness are rather shallow if one does not understand this on his own it cannot be known there is a method of getting to this way however even if one cannot discover it by himself this is found in consultation with others even a person who has not attained this way sees others from the side it is like the saying from the game of go he who sees from the side has eight eyes the saying thought by thought we see our own mistakes also means that the highest way is in discussion with others listening to the old stories and reading is for the purpose of sloughing off ones own discrimination and attaching oneself to that of the ancients
6942508 narutomi hyogo said what is called winning is defeating ones allies defeating ones allies is defeating oneself and defeating oneself is vigorously overcoming ones own body it is as though a man were in the midst of ten thousand allies but not a one were following him if one hasnt previously mastered his mind and body he will not defeat the enemy
6942509 being superior to others is nothing other than having people talk about your affairs and listening to their opinions the general run of people settle for their own opinions and thus never excel having a discussion with a person is one step in excelling him
6942510 the saying the arts aid the body is for samurai of other regions for the samurai of the nabeshima clan the arts bring ruin to the body in all cases the person who practices an art is an artist not a samurai and one should have the intention of being called a samurai when one has the conviction that even the slightest artful ability is harmful to the samurai all the arts become useful to him one should understand this sort of thing
6942511 among the maxims on lord naoshiges wall there was this one matters of great concern should be treated lightly
6942512 for a samurai a single word is important no matter where he may be by just one single word martial valor can be made apparent in peaceful times words show ones bravery in troubled times too one knows that by a single word his strength or cowardice can be seen this single word is the flower of ones heart it is not something said simply by ones mouth
6942513 the occurrence of mysteries is always by word of mouth
6942514 calculating people are contemptible the reason for this is that calculation deals with loss and gain and the loss and gain mind never stops death is considered loss and life is considered gain thus death is something that such a person does not care for and he is contemptible furthermore scholars and their like are men who with wit and speech hide their own true cowardice and greed people often misjudge this
6942515 one can understand that lord naoshiges phrase a faultfinder will come to be punished by others came from his compassion his saying principle is beyond reason should also be considered compassion he enthusiastically stated that we should taste the inexhaustible
6942516 if you cut a face lengthwise urinate on it and trample it with straw sandals it is said that the skin will come off this was heard by priest gyojaku when he was in kyoto it is information to be treasured
6942517 the way of the samurai is found in death meditation on inevitable death should be performed daily every day when ones body and mind are at peace one should meditate upon being ripped apart by arrows rifles spears and swords being carried away by surging waves being thrown into the midst of a great fire being struck by lightning being shaken to death by a great earthquake falling from thousand foot cliffs dying of disease or committing seppuku at the death of ones master and every day without fail one should consider himself as dead this is the substance of the way of the samurai
6942518 there is something to be learned from a rainstorm when meeting with a sudden shower you try not to get wet and run quickly along the road but doing such things as passing under the eaves of houses you still get wet when you are resolved from the beginning you will not be perplexed though you still get the same soaking this understanding extends to everything
6942519 i will admit to a tinge of jealousy as well
6942520 your views are out of line with those of most americans
6942521 its clear they clinton and gore have a message that wants to that they want to have come out of this convention its a mainstream message and i think a little toughness is in order
6942522 its a matter of timing and giving everybody equal opportunity what would you do if you say to one person on your issue and you didnt come before any of the committees ahead of time you get up and were going to allow you to make a five minute speech then how are you going to turn down any of the hundreds of people that might want to get up and make a speech and its just a practical matter it really isnt a big deal
6942523 the convention schedule is set the democrats of the country have spoken as to the direction they want the country to go
6942524 its going to do a take a lot to repair the damage there i think so they could have treated casey better but dont underestimate the democrats are not going to try to fudge it on this issue youve got to be choice on this issue
6942525 theres a process we went through the process governor casey had a full hearing the majority of the democrats didnt buy his position i respect him very much but there is no slight to governor casey

6942663 you sure are angry lately i thought you were smarter than this you hate people who disagree with you that is my definition of a stupid person i wish someone would kick you in the balls

6942683 awesome how bout you waive the fee and i give you a free cat for your trouble
6942684 okay well the way i see it her being constipated just means fewer little piles of tootsie rolls next to the dryer for me to clean up so keep the laxative and ill just buy the ear stuff
6942685 well come on if it was you youd want to move your bowels
6942686 yes that is true in fact id like to move them right here and now to express my displeasure but the difference between my discomfort and hers is that i am human and i have worth

6942787 i would say those 8 are pretty smart because they will never have to endure a knock on the door at five in the morning and be taken away in handcuffs
6942788 those of us from black and brown communities are particularly put out with the role that brazil is playing
6942789 lovinsky shares aristides goals and methods ending poverty and human rights abuses through grassroots mobilization before his abduction lovinsky campaigned for changes to the constitution so haiti would never again have a military
6942790 he was inaudible word for the senate an election he was sure to win
6942791 we know that no struggle has reflected more pain or more human sacrifice but also no struggle has been more of an inspiration and heroic as the struggle of haiti
6942792 haitis inspiring story tells us that the people of the south and the people of the caribbean are showing us the way here in the united states
6942793 so for don we want to say in his honor shouts no more
6942794 the the u n should get out of haiti now
6942795 the haitian people who have always fought for their freedom deserve it more than ever
6942796 brazil as head of the u n forces has a great many contacts and a great of influence of what goes on in haiti and we want their help to find lovinsky
6942797 to urge the haitian and un authorities to double their efforts to locate mr
6942798 i can assure you that the documents that have been brought in the past to the consulate have been sent to the authorities that deal with the issue of haiti at the ministry of foreign affairs they have received them
6942799 so as far as what the consulate is able to do is make sure is that the embassy in washington is informed and that our ministry of foreign relation in brasilia is informed and receives all documents that are brought to our attention by you
6942800 if you have more documents for us well be glad to make sure that these are also sent to the appropriate authorities and well make sure to ask them for a response as quickly as possible
6942801 those of us from black and brown communities are particularly put out with the role that brazil is playing it is not the international image of brazil it is not one that brazil likes to put forward
6942802 so really we want to get some sense of when are we going to hear something from somebody sot hat six months from now were not back here having the same conversation
6942803 w e dont want brazils name to be added to those nations that tolerated disappearances that tolerated starvation that tolerated the kinds of things that are going on in haiti now and so well be back
6942804 me gusta tu blog entr al m o www lagarompa com
6942805 mientras hago la gran rodin me toco uno y evito la yeta
6942806 why then did you bring me out of my mothers womb
6942807 i passed on to you what was most important and what had also been passed on to me that christ died for our sins just as the scriptures said he was buried and he was raised from the dead on the third day as the scriptures said
6942808 and if christ has not been raised then your faith is useless and you are still under condemnation for your sins in that case all who have died believing in christ have perished and if we have hope in christ only for this life we are the most miserable people in the world
6942809 but the fact is that christ has been raised from the dead he has become the first of a great harvest of those who will be raised to life again
6942810 my guilt overwhelms me it is a burden too heavy to bear my wounds fester and stink because of my foolish sins
6942811 but i confess my sins i am deeply sorry for what i have done
6942812 the wicked put up a bold front but the upright proceed with care
6942813 why has paul so carefully proved the resurrection of jesus it wasnt because the corinthian christians believed jesus did not rise from the dead in fact he makes it clear in 1 corinthians 15 11 that they did believe it so we preach and so you believed then why was it important
6942814 for since death came through a man the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man for as in adam all die so in christ all will be made alive
6942815 how long will you say such things your words are a blustering wind
6942816 if you have brains when was the last time you felt them
6942817 a psalm of david to bring us to the lords remembrance
6942818 in the reading from mark the lord jesus was asked which of the mitzvot of the torah is the most important of all or to put it another way what is it that god requires of us what is the purpose of our lives and how can we fulfill that purpose
6942819 the most important commandment is hear o israel the lord our god the lord is one and you shall love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength the second is this you shall love your neighbor as yourself there is no other commandment greater than these
6942820 for he is not a man as i am that i may answer him and that we should go to court together 33 nor is there any mediator between us who may lay his hand on us both 34 let him take his rod away from me and do not let dread of him terrify me 35 then i would speak and not fear him but it is not so with me note it is true that god the father is not a man in fact that is a wonderful thing about god he is god and not a man as such he is totally above all creation he is trustworthy and he is not fickle i samuel 15 nkjv 29 and also the strength of israel will not lie nor relent for he is not a man that he should relent
6942821 t he lord warns us against the vain repetitions of the gentiles who think to be heard for their much praying
6942822 but the word of the master teaches us more he does not say what do you wish but what do you will one often wishes for a thing without willing it i wish to have a certain article but i find the price too high i resolve not to take it i wish but do not will to have it
6942823 the sluggard wishes to be rich but does not will it many a one wishes to be saved but perishes because he does not will it the will rules the whole heart and life if i really will to have anything that is within my reach i do not rest till i have it
6942824 the will is the highest power in the soul grace wants above everything to sanctify and restore this will one of the chief traits of gods image to full and free exercise
6942825 faith is nothing but the purpose of the will resting on gods word and saying i must have it to believe truly is to will firmly
6942826 it is often spiritual sloth that under the appearance of humility professes to have no will because it fears the trouble of searching out the will of god or when the will of god is found it fears the struggle of claiming it in faith true humility is ever in company with strong faith which only seeks to know what is according to the will of god and then boldly claims the fulfillment of the promise in john 15 you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you lord teach us to pray
6942827 can you search out the deep things of god can you find out the limits of the almighty
6942828 the world has yet to see a man fully surrendered to god i will be that man
6942829 hear me lest they rejoice over me lest when my foot slips they exalt themselves against me
6942830 why then have you brought me out of the womb oh that i had perished and no eye had seen me i would have been as though i had not been i would have been carried from the womb to the grave
6942831 i dont think anybody here expected wed get this kind of response
6942832 when it got picked up by apple we were surprised when it went to no 1 we were really surprised
6942833 were getting a lot of interest in the last four days from international companies that might not already know about us
6942834 if i was looking for someone to make a widget that is probably the first place id go
6942835 if youre in the widget business having built a widget that is very successful is the best thing you can have done
6942836 if you create something that fits a need itll take off
6942837 its the kind of cinderella story were seeing with increasing frequency on the internet
6942838 they thrive on litter and their aggressive behaviour towards other birds pets and even people is increasing
6942839 who has had to abandon his deliveries due to constant attacks from the birds
6942840 they thrive on litter and their aggressive behaviour towards other birds pets and even people is increasing
6942841 oh hell nah that bitch tried to say something about my shirt the other day but i just ignored her you should too itll be okay
6942842 this world has been connected tied to the darkness soon to be completely eclipsed
6942843 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6942844 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign
6942845 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6942846 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6942847 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6942848 we get a lot of calls sometimes for things like war trophies that grandpa brought back from world war ii stuff like that
6942849 the new nato states in the baltics and central europe are not unlike the us or britain preoccupied with terrorism afghanistan or irans nuclear potential
6942850 moscow is well aware that few nato members want to extend a mutual security guarantee to a country at war with europes biggest neighbour
6942851 the main question is are you willing to go to war for tbilisi i think the answer is no
6942852 wow great job on the legos lets see how fast we can get the nerf ammo put away
6942853 gonna give you every inch of my mud gonna give you my mud
6942854 theres gonna be a storm the complete recordings 1966 1969
6942855 until we figure out a way to lift 41 of our african american community out of poverty were not going to be the city we need to be
6942856 chopper read could play tony abbott then at least on the screen he could have a softer more likeable persona michael costa could be played by jabba the hut
6942857 i think our sexiest pollie hands down at the moment is foreign minister stephen smith and i think it would be a safe bet to assume that the us secretary of state has something approaching a crush on him there is no other explanation for her recent bizarre visit to perth i can only imagine how hurt alexander downer is at condys betrayal as to who would play him in a movie clive owen perhaps
6942858 morris iemma should be played by paris hilton both are comprehensively useless to everyone mark latham to be played by mike tyson kevin rudd to be played by ian mcdiarmid the emperor from star wars philip ruddock to be played by a mannequin
6942859 if we were going on looks alone cult actor and father of laura palmer in twin peaks ray wise would have to play dr nelson the likeness is uncanny
6942860 then again brendan also bears more than a passing resemblance to brain from the cartoon pinky and the brain
6942861 surely tilda swinton as julia gillard and dame margaret rutherford as alexander downer
6942862 daniel craig is peter debnam jodie foster is maxine mckew angelina jolie is julia gillard michael caine is peter costello montgomery burns is bob carr
6942863 john wayne as wilson tuckey not very intelligent doesnt think before he speaks or acts sees violence as an appropriate method of conflict resolution
6942864 cadel evans is john della bosca dolly parton is julie bishop david st hubins is brendan nelson steve buscemi is michael costa f murray abraham is tony abbott

6942930 u s senator tom coburn m d r ok released a report today detailing the rapid growth in the annual number of hours federal employees are found to be absent without leave awol from their jobs since 2001 18 federal departments and agencies reported that employees have been awol for at least 19 6 million hours when they should have otherwise been working the investigation found that annual awol hours have increased gradually since 2001 climbing from approximately 2 5 million hours per year to 3 5 million hours in 2007 the disturbing findings of this report are an example of inefficiencies in the federal government that would not be tolerated in private companies

6942974 sin may be more beneficial for a person if it leads him to repent than doing a lot of acts of worship this is what is meant by the words of one of the salaf a person may commit a sin and enter paradise because of it or he may do an act of worship and enter hell because of it they said how is that he said he may commit a sin and continues to think about it and when he stands or sits or walks he remembers his sin so he feels ashamed and repents and seeks forgiveness and regrets it so that will be the means of his salvation and he may do a good deed and continue to think about it and when he stands or sits or walks he remembers it and it fills him with self admiration and pride so it is the cause of his doom so the sin may be the factor that leads him to do acts of worship and good deeds and to change his attitude so that he fears allah and feels shy before him and feels humiliated before him hanging his head in shame and weeping with regret seeking he forgiveness of his lord each of these effects is better for a person than an act of worship that makes him feel proud and show off and look down on people undoubtedly this sin is better before allah and is more likely to bring salvation than one who admires himself and looks down on others and who thinks that he is doing allah a favor even if he says words that indicate something other than that allah is the witness over what is in his heart such a person may feel hatred towards people if they do not hold him in high esteem and humiliate themselves before him if he were to examine himself honestly he would see that clearly

6942998 in the six unfounded complaints the persons or the businesses reported counterfeit bills because the money didnt have the metallic strips a security feature on the bill
6942999 after investigation we later determined that it was good money
6943000 from what i can understanding the metallic security feature has only been added to the 5 bills over the past couple of years so there are still 5 bills in circulation that dont have that security feature
6943001 i guess people are believing that because it doesnt have the security feature it is not legitimate but it is its just an old bill that should be returned to the bank and a new one reissued
6943002 the bank of canada is working hard to remove older notes from circulation
6943003 businesses can help by depositing older notes at financial institutions they in turn will check them and return them to the bank of canada for destruction
6943004 bank notes have security features that are reliable quick and easy to use
6943005 simply touch tilt and look at the bills and with newer notes that have a metallic stripe you can point them towards a light to verify several see through features
6943006 its a good habit to verify your notes just as you check your change and credit card receipts its quick and easy to do you protect yourself and you eliminate opportunities for counterfeiters

6943017 a persons credit history is really established the first time they ever apply for a charge card and from that point onward all the credit vehicles you use they report on an ongoing basis to the three main credit reporting agencies
6943018 the three major credit agencies have a rating system and its a number system and the higher number the better but they rate you from poor fair good and excellent
6943019 its based on your payment history its based on the amount that you owe its based on how long youve had credit its a number of factors that are going to go into creating that number that theyre going to use to determine if you have good or bad credit
6943020 dont accept all those credit card offers that are put in front of you because youre going to get into trouble and then youre not going to be able to pay all your bills and youre going to have late payments
6943021 another thing is that sometimes when you go to a store theyll say establish this credit card and then youll get ten percent off for the first day or two you shouldnt even really do a lot of those

6943031 the court hereby adopts the stipulation of the parties as to the appointment of a parenting coordinator with arbitration powers under statute x the parenting coordinator shall be arb man retainer and all subsequent charges shall be split between the parties on a 50 50 basis and shall be paid 30 days from the date of this order
6943032 1 with the consent of all parties the court may appoint an arbitrator to resolve disputes between the parties concerning the parties minor or dependent children including but not limited to parenting time nonrecurring adjustments to child support and disputed parental decisions
6943033 since may of 2005 when i first started as parenting coordinator with arbitration power for this family i have seen virtually no evidence of the ability of the parties to cooperate to make decision jointly mh has spent 2520 on my services to arbitrate decisions regarding the children per court order mh is responsible for only 50 of my charges but since ed has refused to participate financially in the process mh has paid 100 of the costs in order to get decision made and filed with the court all of the arbitrations to date have been awards that basically matched mhs requests these arbitrations were made because mhs requests were seen as being in the best interests of the children i believe that these issues needed to be arbitrated because ed was either going to take no action regarding these issues or act in a unilateral manner regarding these issue in either case both strategies resulted in a type of sole decision making position for ed that mh could only counter through arbitration this process depleted mh of funds that could be used for the children delayed important decision regarding the children and added to the conflict between these two co parents
6943034 mh must consult with ed in writing before any major parental decision is made if ed believes that mh has made a decision that is not in the best interests of the children and she wishes to arbitrate that decision she must contact me copying mh immediately to schedule an arbitration i will schedule an arbitration 10 working days in order for checks to clear after i receive a 600 deposit from each party if mhs decision is reversed or significantly modified through arbitration mh will pay 100 of the arbitration if mhs decision is substantially upheld through the arbitration process then ed will be 100 responsible for the cost of the arbitration
6943035 the arbitrators award shall be effective immediately upon entry and shall continue in effect until vacated by the arbitrator pursuant to section statute a modified or corrected by the arbitrator pursuant to section statute b or modified by the court pursuant to a de novo review under subsection 2 of this section

6943068 a draft agreement between the united states and iraq contains no fixed dates for u s forces to withdraw but iraq would like combat troops out by the end of 2011 government spokesman ali al dabbagh said on thursday

6943070 towards the end of july after a secure video conference between president bush and prime minister maliki we announced that as part of any agreement with the iraqis establishing our future bilateral releationship would include aspirational time horizons goals for women iraqi troops begin to take over more of the combat mission in various parts of iraq which allow for more us troops to come home so any discussions that are ongoing that we are having with the iraqis right now include these aspirational timelines these goals for more troops to come home
6943071 the shiite domination government in iraq is driving out many leaders of sunni citizen patrols the groups of former insurgents who joined the american payroll and have been a major pillar in the decline in violence around the nation
6943072 these people are like cancer and we must remove them
6943073 like a drug addict who quits only to take drugs again
6943074 were not going to walk away from them and as i said prime minister maliki committed to taking care of them i do think it is somewhat understandable that the government struggles to hire former insurgents for its security forces or for its ministerial positions but this is how you end these kinds of conflicts thats why they call it reconciliation its not done with ones friends its done with former enemies

6943122 we are concerned that depositors in downeys footprint have a heightened sensitivity to potential bank failures after recent experience and publicity which increases the possibility that downey could experience further material deposit outflows
6943123 if that were to happen it could overwhelm downeys liquidity and or trigger an adverse regulatory action
6943124 i view the current situation as reasonably balanced with a great deal of uncertainty around both the downsides to growth and the upsides to inflation
6943125 the reasonable policy debate will be around holding versus raising rates
6943126 if the inflation numbers remain high which is another way of saying if im wrong then i may support action earlier
6943127 the outlook for the second half of the year and going into 2009 is well see some alleviation of inflation pressures having oil and other commodities come down so strongly helps

6943131 these actions have raised the costs of mortgage credit and reduced its availability
6943132 policy makers had been hoping they would move forward to provide more credit and now theyre just hoping they dont pull back
6943133 the cost of mortgage credit is getting pushed higher by the issues in the marketplace
6943134 they cant reduce their market exposure and that means more expensive mortgages
6943135 any time theres an additional imposition of fees in obtaining a mortgage it knocks some potential buyers out of the market
6943136 these are people who often rely on their good credit to buy investment properties putting little or no money down

6943152 if you want creative workers give them enough time to play
6943153 i was struck by one story the book about a man who went to his fireplace and told it
6943154 the first duty of a leader is to make himself be loved without courting love to be loved without playing up to anyone even to himself

6943160 dr thaksin is embarrassed about the indignity brought on all the entities the club the premier league he never intended this
6943161 dr thaksin has been really open about this he has said to me if you need me to resign from the football club as a director because it would serve the needs of the premier league then im fine with that as long as that doesnt change any other thing
6943162 i think there is a very loose term about what is fit and proper it is almost a tongue in cheek term that you would use for premier league football over the last 10 years there are plenty of unfit and improper individuals
6943163 dr thaksin is in a political situation and a case that affects his assets so thats well documented so thats a hurdle
6943164 the truth of it is this club is not going to go out of business this club is not bankrupt were moving forward
6943165 hopefully the champions league will take me on to the next stage

6943169 hopefully we can take that in to the next few years and make us a better team
6943170 i am an unselfish player i have said that many times
6943171 i dont just judge my performance on goals i look at assists and how i have helped the team play that is the way my game is
6943172 unselfishness is maybe not the biggest crime to have as a footballer
6943173 it shows qualities of teamwork and a general nature which is terrific to see in footballers
6943174 we are in an era of individual appreciation earrings tattoos goals the need to be seen
6943175 but they eat like fruit and sandwiches and healthy stuff for lunch

6943180 here is the truth fighting a war without end will not force the iraqis to take responsibility for their own future and fighting in a war without end will not make the american people safer so when i am commander in chief i will set a new goal on day one i will end this war not because politics compels it not because our troops cannot bear the burden as heavy as it is but because it is the right thing to do for our national security and it will ultimately make us safer
6943181 i didnt think the scoring was going to be this low
6943182 it is a good course youve got to do a lot of good things
6943183 the greens are tough and when hunter goes out and shoots that nine under round yesterday it shows you that it is capable and it is out there
6943184 no question especially thursday morning to friday afternoon its a different golf course the greens are definitely bouncy and firmer and definitely played tougher
6943185 the schools stare fixedly into the past as we hurtle pell mell into the future
6943186 they are characteristics of the spirit mood language and process of science they are operative wherever evidence of social change can be found
6943187 a new kind of person one who is an actively inquiring flexible creative innovative tolerant liberal personality who can face uncertainty and ambiguity without disorientation who can formulate viable new meanings to meet changes in the environment which threaten individual and mutual survival
6943188 what do we now i know start a blog vent vent vent vent vent send mission accomplished i dont want to put down the idea of blogs the blog explosion has happened in part because more and more people completely distrust the joke of corporate mcnews
6943189 the blogosphere is limited to an echo chamber where all agree with all
6943190 when you look at big picture its pretty damn depressing but doesnt stop people from winning small local battles
6943191 this is a contest a war and its not red against blue or left against right its between the top and the bottom a class war is being waged in this country against almost everybody who lives in this country
6943192 life doesnt have to be this way we dont have to be so stupid we dont have to be so obedient we need to illuminate whats possible illuminating good ideas is what put them on track to slowly becoming reality
6943193 new book out and making the move to open access
6943194 i thought collage great way to talk about systems of power and pop culture we were using the media to talk about the media
6943195 the more negativland started appropriating media the more we thought about it means
6943196 they thrive on litter and their aggressive behaviour towards other birds pets and even people is increasing

6943200 when an action is rationally justified how can reason deny its legitimacy

6943202 were always evaluating whats happening in the marketplace and certainly something thats happening in the last couple of months is that sonys managed to sell some boxes
6943203 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
6943204 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
6943205 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
6943206 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

6943214 la multitud respondi con un sollozo gigante las mujeres se desmayaron en 15 o 20 lugares otras sobrecogidas se tumbaron en las banquetas y hundieron la cabeza entre los brazos los hombres se apoyaban en los hombros de otros hombres y lloraban

6943218 virginia gov tom kaine spread word he had been ruled out and sen evan bayh of indiana was told he was not obamas choice according to party officials
6943219 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6943220 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign
6943221 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6943222 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6943223 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6943224 celebrities dont have to worry about family budgets but we sure do
6943225 maybe mccain thinks this economy is working for folks like him
6943226 pr oposed stronger job protections for doctors and other health care workers who refuse to participate in abortions because of religious or moral objections
6943227 we need to take the politics out of the day to day and term to term management of schools we need to strip ministers of their power to meddle and micro manage and give them a new strategic role and we need government to stop being so afraid of diversity
6943228 there is nothing wrong with different schools being different from one another in fact when the system encompasses difference schools can learn from others success and improve together in a way that is impossible when uniformity is imposed from above
6943229 the department for children schools and families would be halved in size
6943230 an educational standards authority would be a powerful body with independent oversight of exam standards with responsibility for schools inspection incorporating the existing ofsted and with responsibility for commissioning research on good educational practices and disseminating advice on best practice to schools
6943231 by scaling back some of the excessive national testing at key stages 1 and 3 in particular we will save millions of pounds and the money can be put directly into improving basic skills for those who presently fall behind from day one and never catch up
6943232 the new york giants will welcome him to the big apple smart guys retire and stay retired with a super bowl ring of course if you dont have a ring it doesnt make sense to retire i guess thats why hes coming back

6943236 hes a member of one of the largest rls families in the world
6943237 we identified variants genetic variants in three genes which and these variants increased the risk to develop rls
6943238 for every 10 000 people here in this community there is one physician in iraq for every 1 500 people there is one physician there is a huge disparity
6943239 i would go clinic to clinic or wherever i could find a spot
6943240 thats great because it is one facility for everybody you dont have to travel different places and i like that
6943241 we do have our own pediatrician internal medicine physician an obgyn and a surgeon we do provide hiv services as well we have our own dentist and our adult day care center
6943242 we really believe that we now have the model for the future of providing care for communities in need
6943243 our mission is to provide access to people in need one way or another we are going to get that accomplished
6943244 this gives the impression the city of lodi police dept endorses the candidate for political office
6943245 it wasnt prearranged or anything the officer was on the street and we stopped and talked to him
6943246 nikki has a strong sense of justice and shes a great advocate for people in need
6943247 our local vets have supported the moraine emergency clinic for years and i anticipate that our local vets will still refer cases there for overnight care thankfully dayton is big enough to support two clinics
6943248 we are here when regular vets are closed we consider ourselves an extension of the regular veterinarians practice
6943249 we looked at the dec as someone weve worked with but our feeling is that its an older practice in an older area of town we provide a little different services dayton care center is designed for the more complicated cases
6943250 if you have nothing good to say dont say anything at all
6943251 sticks and stones can break my bones but words can never hurt me
6943252 ge credit union just walked over home plate chipotle is at third rounding into home and panera is on first thinking about stealing second
6943253 i think chipotle is a definite panera is really looking at it very very seriously and well look at some other tenants to fill it in
6943254 its just a four acre tract were developing in the front area
6943255 kelly shoppach and ryan garko will likely be the odd men out
6943256 my guess is that sal fasano and andy gonzalez will be the odd men out
6943257 arrests and violations of the nfl conduct code have become an unfortunate trend amongst the leagues players
6943258 and its an excellent way for us to make some money
6943259 did ravens fans eat paint chips when they were kids
6943260 hafner is done he will never play well in this league again
6943261 why did the browns fall short of the playoffs last season
6943262 5 is your friend and teammate braylon edwards plotting some sort of revenge after gashing his foot a couple weeks ago nah laughs hes just working to get back he will be fine hes taking care of his foot and he will be ready soon
6943263 hey remember that time you hurt the all pro wr
6943264 yes he may not be aggressive on the base paths he may not be a fan of bunting ever and he just couldnt get along with brandon phillips
6943265 name something that a woman has invented that involves more than two moving parts
6943266 who invented the doily count doyley was supposedly a decorator back in 17th century london he created the first doilies they were made of a woolen material in the 1800s in france they started making the paper doily they were brought here to the united states in the mid 1800s
6943267 can you name anything with more than two moving parts that was invented by a woman
6943268 can you name anything that was invented by a woman
6943269 will allow us to be as aggressive on commercial as we are on residential
6943270 it adds a tremendously more human dimension to the street
6943271 this is an opportunity to talk about some serious issues
6943272 a lot of people have good intentions but dont always come through maybe this will be different
6943273 its people coming out of their homes and taking their community back without fear
6943274 the crime here is real the solution is not to hide but to deal with these complex situations in a variety of ways
6943275 drive by shootings murders muggings prostitution death threats to name a few these issues are real
6943276 dyna is not making it up i am just tired of listening to her complain
6943277 we should all be thankful for and celebrate that small cry that brought us together to possibly make a better minneapolis
6943278 i know it cannot hurt to talk to people while sipping something cold and eating some good food
6943279 quite often the business community will see project management as overhead and as beauracracy
6943280 we did nothing wrong we did everything right and now that weve cleaned up the mess made all the sacrifices invested ourselves and our very lives into this theyd decided to pull the plug on us
6943281 were deemed no longer profitable enough to justify the expenditure of keeping us here
6943282 a nice shiny new ship crewed by some nice shiny new people
6943283 but theres a reason they couldnt give it to us
6943284 they couldnt give it to us because it would be too easy for us with your skill at manipulating the ancient tech and my genius for making things work the new expedition would be boring
6943285 but no not the rest of us no weve been traded in for younger hipper models i hear they wanted johnny depp for your part but then they decided he was too old
6943286 the one theyre not giving us does it have a name
6943287 yeah us ive been meaning to talk to you about that
6943288 see believe it or not i knew this day would come at some point i was hoping it would be later rather than now frankly im not really ready for it to be now but that point is moot now isnt it
6943289 im not saying i knew the how or why mind you only that at some point for whatever reason we might need a way out
6943290 its just that well ive always been afraid that you might get recalled to earth because the military has a ridiculous amount of say over your life and i mean look what happened to sam they dont even tell her whats going down until she returns to earth and then they blindsided her with it and there was always the possibility someone would find out about us
6943291 so ive been working on an infinite alternative reality drive
6943292 rodney i thought we discussed this once already its too dangerous
6943293 i know i havent gotten all the bugs worked out of it yet but its nothing like what happened on the daedalus i swear besides can any assignment compare to atlantis can you really see yourself staying on in the military working for the sgc after they destroyed your trust like this
6943294 heres the thing we can enter a series of endless alternate realities through the drive stay as long as we want or need in each one john we can bring whomever we want with us
6943295 we can see whomever we want again carson elizabeth there in the flesh as real as you or i
6943296 well okay its a series of alternate realities so everything we experience there would feel very real to us because it would actually be happening to us but think about it we could live out our lives in peace and contentment or we might never age at all we could die in one reality and live on in a thousand others we could have all the adventures in the universe and when we were tired of that we could retire here in atlantis all our enemies defeated or we could settle down in some house on the beach somewhere get a few cats maybe a dog
6943297 is that i havent yet figured out how to make sure in all realities that youre mine i mean i could have used some more time to work on that another year would have been nice not to say that the realities in which you are paired with someone else dont have the potential for incendiary hotness but just the same
6943298 it takes time to persuade men to do even what is for their own good
6943299 tell them you have been abused and you will receive all you need
6943300 my husband could black my eye so me and the kid could go to a battered womans shelter
6943301 you dont put up any more barriers for victims wanting to enter the shelter
6943302 in all the time that i volunteered there i saw one woman who showed signs of physical abuse
6943303 were just gaming the system all they had to do was make up some tale about some man abusing them no proof needed and they could stay up to two months at the shelter
6943304 free hostel for women with emotional problems if they are willing to hate their husbands enough and are willing to take out protective orders against their husbands
6943305 after hours some of these women would sneak men into their rooms the same men who had supposedly abused them
6943306 i on numerous occasions reported illegal drug use that i had witnessed take place on shelter property and often my complaints were ignored
6943307 in 2006 5 886 individuals were turned away from shelters in colorado due to a lack of capacity
6943308 i do not want to live on this twisted sick system i dont want them in my life i dont want to play the game and lie i only need help
6943309 since marriage constitutes slavery for women it is clear that the womens movement must concentrate on attacking this institution freedom for women cannot be won without the abolition of marriage
6943310 families have supported oppression by separating people into small isolated units unable to join together to fight for common interests
6943311 it takes time to persuade men to do even what is for their own good
6943312 this is rich a self described anti feminist lawyer has decided to sue columbia university for offering womens studies courses because they are discriminatory towards men

6943320 new water and sewage project in the west bank the jwc is made up of an equal number of representatives of israel and the palestinian authority all its decisions are made by consensus and no mechanism is established to settle disputes where a consensus cannot be attained this method of decision making means that israel is able to veto any request by the palestinian representatives to drill a new well to obtain the additions stipulated in the agreement
6943321 we are unable to confirm this incident we are informed the rest of the crew are safe
6943322 all the three ships are still moving and appear to be heading toward somali territorial water a warship has been despatched to monitor and track the vessels
6943323 somalia has no central government we are worried that more may join the pirates to hijack ships because its very lucrative and there is no deterrent
6943324 the united nations is the only agency that can stop this menace the international community has to agree to find ways to solve this worsening problem that is the only way forward
6943325 this is a welcome move by the deputy prime minister
6943326 women need to play the role of mother first they cant sacrifice that
6943327 it will definitely lead to better productivity among the women workers as they will be happier
6943328 in todays context civilisations are increasingly diluted to the point of non recognition
6943329 with this in mind universities are ideally placed to act as bridges between civilisations

6943335 mushrooms have a short life cycle but they can be grown all year round
6943336 moreover their market price is high and so is their yield
6943337 a shed with about 1 000 healthy bags of spores can produce four kilogrammes of mushrooms a day and at a price of rm10 a kg a participant can easily earn rm40 a day

6943347 the majority of the families are poverty stricken and they will not be able to buy a house they will merely move on to another piece of land and there will be no end to the squatter problems

6943354 eighteen years in the state assembly that is quite long for an opposition member
6943355 gerakan is always open to opinions especially suggestions to revive the party and the barisan nasional coalition
6943356 whatever their opinions are members should analyse the situation as well as take into consideration the current political scenario and the strength of the party when making decisions
6943357 certain quarters had made the call for the party to leave the ruling coalition but it was only a small number that made the call
6943358 the majority of members still want the party to stay in the bn and help to revive and strengthen the coalition
6943359 if the bn could not defend the rights of all races in malaysia then the national gerakan leaders should consider leaving the coalition

6943374 in this case it is not because of market downturn it is because the company has decided to act in its self interest at the expense of the workforce and the community
6943375 we think that this company needs to be held to account by government

6943385 we need a place where people can have a discussion and get information
6943386 and people need to know that its not coming from an anti mormon place or a gay castro district place its coming from a faithful place
6943387 when i heard and saw the letter that the church leaders had read in sacrament meetings i was appalled
6943388 so i said thats it i want mormons to know that there are gay people in their congregations every sunday
6943389 i really just want people to try and understand and see the pain they are causing gay members of the church who are struggling

6943391 if there would have been a site like this it would have been really helpful
6943392 last time during prop 22 all i did was vote no this time i wanted to stand up and be heard even though its hard
6943393 there is a lot of anxiety and stress over being conflicted being an active mormon and being for gay marriage
6943394 thats part of the reason we wanted to do the site

6943414 people sort of have this well you cant go into these countries certainly there are war areas but by and large people are helpful you stop people on the street and ask for directions people are more than willing to help
6943415 you are under so much pressure and adrenaline that sometimes you say stuff you didnt mean
6943416 but its just because youre focused eventually you have to come out of it with some forgiveness and understanding that were all human and make mistakes

6943431 could force policymakers in the united states and europe to reevaluate incentives they have adopted to spur production of ethanol based fuels
6943432 president bush and many members of congress have touted expanding biofuel use as an integral element of the nations battle against climate change but these studies suggest that this strategy will damage the planet rather than help protect it
6943433 over 30 years use of traditional corn based ethanol would produce twice as much greenhouse gas emissions as regular gasoline
6943434 it would take 167 years before biofuel would stop contributing to climate change
6943435 even if its 167 years youre still better off than burning oil that can never be paid off

6943446 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
6943447 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6943448 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6943449 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6943450 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6943451 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
6943452 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
6943453 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales

6943455 este proceso tiene como objetivo central resguardar el derecho de las personas naturales y jur dicas que puedan sentirse afectadas a hacer las observaciones ambientales que estimen pertinentes enriqueciendo la evaluaci n y d ndole a la autoridad mayores herramientas para resolver al respecto
6943456 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6943457 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6943458 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
6943459 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
6943460 faber is the best of the world now to beat him i think you have to be in a good shape hes an expert fighter and he has a good gas its complicated to beat a guy like him you have to set a good game plan and be calm and watch the elbows because if you hits you can chane a whole fight

6943462 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
6943463 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
6943464 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
6943465 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6943466 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6943467 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6943468 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
6943469 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6943470 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6943471 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6943472 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6943473 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6943474 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6943475 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6943476 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6943477 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6943478 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6943479 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto

6943483 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6943484 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

6943489 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6943490 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6943491 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6943492 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6943493 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6943494 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6943495 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6943496 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6943497 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6943498 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6943499 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6943500 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6943501 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6943502 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6943503 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6943504 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6943505 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6943506 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6943507 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6943508 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6943509 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

6943511 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6943512 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6943513 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6943514 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba

6943517 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6943518 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6943519 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6943520 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6943521 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6943522 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6943523 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
6943524 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6943525 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6943526 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6943527 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6943528 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
6943529 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
6943530 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
6943531 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
6943532 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
6943533 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
6943534 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
6943535 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
6943536 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
6943537 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6943538 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6943539 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6943540 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6943541 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6943542 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6943543 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6943544 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6943545 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6943546 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6943547 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6943548 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6943549 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6943550 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6943551 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6943552 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6943553 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6943554 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6943555 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6943556 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6943557 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6943558 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6943559 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6943560 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6943561 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6943562 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6943563 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6943564 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6943565 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6943566 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6943567 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6943568 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
6943569 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6943570 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6943571 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6943572 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6943573 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6943574 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6943575 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6943576 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6943577 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6943578 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6943579 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6943580 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6943581 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6943582 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6943583 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6943584 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6943585 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6943586 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6943587 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6943588 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6943589 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6943590 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6943591 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6943592 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6943593 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6943594 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

6943602 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6943603 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6943604 oh well go to x and ill write about it
6943605 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6943606 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6943607 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6943608 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6943609 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6943610 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6943611 through sb 1527 the bayshore neighborhood can finally be revitalized and receive a grocery store bank post office and elementary school

6943616 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6943617 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6943618 im ready to shave and get on a plane to springfield but i havent heard anything

6943677 then when i started student teaching i began to hear
6943678 i was driving us to the bear and wolf area when i saw a car stopped right in front of me
6943679 there was a bear in front of it so i stopped too and started taking pictures
6943680 i saw it take a hubcap off the car then start walking towards us i locked all the doors quickly we didnt know what it would do
6943681 it put the hubcap down and then banged on the window as if it was trying to get my attention
6943682 it was almost like it wanted to give me the wheel cap
6943683 my little boy was crying but my daughter was enjoying it she was saying oh my god mummy look what hes doing
6943684 quite soon after a park warden came along and shooed the bear away
6943685 she asked me whose the hubcap was so it could be returned to the car in front
6943686 it was very strange i dont know what the bear was doing
6943687 in a funny way i thought oh no maybe even animals are starting to take hubcaps as well as people
6943688 i should give him something he can hold to comfort him
6943689 im leaving but ill be right back im just getting something to eat i will leave my pocketbook with you these are my keys which she jangled and let me touch you know i cant drive home without my keys

6943722 we havent seen that yet its my understanding that they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
6943723 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
6943724 should go back to the situation before the hostilities started
6943725 the idea is that yes for a temporary period some russian peace forces could stay on next to the border line of ossetia but its temporary it should be for patrolling and it should be until we have an international mechanism
6943726 it was clearly stated that this presence first has to be through patrolling no fixed presence and second should not have an effect on the freedom of movement on roads and trains in this place

6943752 teaching is a very honorable profession and in my eyes its a sacred profession
6943753 sacred because we are here for the community of massillon for the citizens of massillon and most importantly for the students of massillon
6943754 this is just to show our support for the teachers of massillon
6943755 we are all here and we are ready to start another year we are going to be professional
6943756 no one should believe that we are not interested in what the teachers have to say or that they are not interested in what we have to say
6943757 what people need to understand is that our system is not at war there is just a negotiations process going on
6943758 we are all here to do the same thing and that is to provide the best possible education for students
6943759 i believe that the teachers display of unity is proof that we are all on the same page i believe that i am on the same side as the teachers and they are on my side

6943775 that was placed in the contract about 12 years ago and that is one of the provisions of our contract that i dont like

6943777 i know theres similar language in other contracts in the county
6943778 larry morgan tries to put them in all stark county contracts
6943779 i think that larry morgan is the kind of guy that likes to have control and thats one way he can have control over the union members
6943780 i believe that larry morgan would like to get one master agreement for the whole county oapses not going to stand by and let him get a master agreement just because he wants one
6943781 thats not a just clause for the working people of those districts to me its wrong
6943782 whenever we prepare for negotiations i represent the boards of education i dont go to the table to bring my issues to the table is that clause in other contracts in the county yes it is
6943783 in negotiations my style is to look at the issues and work to get a solution that is seen as fair and meets the needs of the individuals
6943784 hes got more experience i would guess than any superintendent in stark county in negotiating contracts
6943785 but all the decisions are made locally here any direction hes getting hes getting from me and my team
6943786 i would say he was the spokesperson but we were all at the table
6943787 i didnt want to come to the table without some expert advice which is larrys role
6943788 i think the proof of that is the fact that we settled in one day

6943825 i really like your blog going to have to add it to my daily websites
6943826 it covers a wide spectrum of cycling issues european and domestic racing as well as some of the history and tradition of the sport very well written and presented
6943827 lately ive been enjoying the collaborative cycling blog run in part by former chicagoan leonard basobas as someone who admittedly doesnt follow the nrc much except for when its racing nearby this fans point of view is useful for staying abreast of the various personalities and storylines
6943828 then i composed myself because i didnt want him to see me crying

6943852 i m delighted to be part of this project because i think it s very important that asian women should have a voice and be able to express just how they feel about life today in this country

6943864 a very powerful flashlight directed at the moon would theoretically create a bright spot on its surface by simply turning the flashlight sideways the flashlights beam streaks across the sky at speeds far exceeding the speed of light this evidence has long been known and dismissed since the bright spot cannot be used for superluminal or faster than light communication between the earth and the moon the fast motion of the bright spot is simply a geometrical artifact similar in some ways to the point at which the two blades of closing scissors intersect the theory of relativity does not concern such purely geometrical objects

6943900 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6943901 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6943902 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6943903 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6943904 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6943905 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6943906 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6943907 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6943908 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6943909 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6943910 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6943911 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6943912 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6943913 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6943914 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6943915 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6943916 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6943917 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6943918 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6943919 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6943920 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6943921 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6943922 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6943923 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6943924 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6943925 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6943926 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6943927 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6943928 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6943929 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6943930 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6943931 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6943932 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6943933 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6943934 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6943935 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6943936 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6943937 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6943938 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6943939 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6943940 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6943941 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6943942 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6943943 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6943944 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6943945 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6943946 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6943947 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6943948 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6943949 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6943950 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6943951 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6943952 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6943953 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6943954 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6943955 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6943956 this is a planning took where all things are going
6943957 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6943958 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6943959 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6943960 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6943961 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6943962 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6943963 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6943964 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6943965 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6943966 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6943967 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6943968 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6943969 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6943970 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6943971 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6943972 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6943973 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6943974 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6943975 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6943976 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6943977 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6943978 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6943979 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6943980 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6943981 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6943982 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6943983 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6943984 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6943985 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6943986 first you call me a liar then youre telling me that you arent going to give me a refund for your faulty services
6943987 i m sorry would you like a refund or fresh food
6943988 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6943989 we kind of snuck up on michigan they didnt practice for us now we got a d i team that is practicing like its a big game which it really is
6943990 if she showed up naked at my door with a pizza
6943991 xbox is a natural partner to help us reach out to youth voters
6943992 to realize our goal of registering 2 million young americans by this fall we need to go where young americans are and theres no doubt in our minds that many are on xbox 360 and xbox live
6943993 were thrilled to partner with rock the vote to make it easier than ever for youth voters and our members to register and be heard
6943994 were packing and moving our lab and our other belongings
6943995 its important to have researchers whove had the opportunity to work with the corporate side of research thats one of the things eric brings
6943996 its ridiculous how fast can you go before the world record cant be broke how fast can the human

6943999 frank bonnin was not terminated by smalltownpapers he informed us prior to his five week military training event that he was leaving our company immediately to pursue other business interests with another former employee
6944000 his voluntary departure simply had nothing at all to do with his military training but rather with a personal decision to work elsewhere

6944122 i didnt think we played well in the first half we were lucky
6944123 we were just off we were a little bit lethargic but as you said the character of the team is great they listen to what we have to say at halftime they came out in the second half with a lot more energy we were a lot more direct with our play we stretched their defense got behind them and as a result of that we started to create some chances and then the goals came
6944124 we definitely wanted to come get three points and make a statement that were for real
6944125 we wanted to come down and really put it to them but theyre a good team and they play really well in houston in all this heat
6944126 we wanted to come out early and try to press them and get a goal early if we could and that happened i think every one of our forwards who came in got at least point and thats a good sign weve just got to get back to being stingy on defense and continue scoring goals
6944127 i will miss toronto and the teams amazing supporters and fans toronto fc will always have special meaning for me because its the club that gave me my professional start i want to thank mo johnston john carver the coaching staff and my teammates for making my time with toronto fc such a memorable experience that i will carry with me for the rest of my life

6944130 we kept a shutout which was very important and something we talked about at halftime overall it was an excellent win we are scoring goals now and playing very well so i am pleased for the guys because i do know the work they are putting in every day
6944131 it was a fantastic result i think we went the entire 90 minutes and deserved the three points
6944132 we had a great effort and some outstanding individual performances it was great to have a clean sheet and a second consecutive win
6944133 i think it shows that were ready to make a run here
6944134 weve been talking about it for a number of weeks but i think everybody is settling into their position knowing their role on the team and were starting to figure it out
6944135 theres still a lot of games to go but im very pleased were picking the pace up right now and were winning against two teams from the same conference

6944248 if i had gone on presenting oscar wildes play there would not have been a single spectator in my theatre and all the theatres are in the same situation thats what i find so wonderful about this country of ours
6944249 it is the only country in which even scandals serve to highlight public morality oscar wilde is not only finished as a gentleman but also as a playwright
6944250 in france if such a thing had happened to a dramatist it would have given his play enormous publicity
6944251 we have been tolerating the highhandedness of the cpms district committee for the past seven years or so
6944252 the district leaders were ignoring the opinions of the local leaders and often thrust their personal wishes on us in the name of the party
6944253 the charges were nothing but a fallout of our protests against some decisions made by the district committee
6944254 the cpm had promised permanent jobs to 500 1000 youths in matigara at the uttarayon township and to another 450 at the videocon unit opened at the sick kanchan factory
6944255 till date not a single person has got a job in any of these projects
6944256 our leader and bengal urban development minister asok bhattacharya opposed this move and even secured the nod of the chief minister buddhadeb bhattacharjee for action against the party members finding no other options they are now levelling false allegations against the party and have joined the congress
6944257 some cpm leaders and supporters in matigara had flouted the party guidelines they left the party after it was decided that steps should be taken against them we dont think that their departure would make any impact on the party in the area
6944258 we are happy to augment our support base in matigara block and hope that the congress will perform better in the next elections
6944259 we have asked police to compile the number of accidents in the past one year so that we can have an idea of the frequency and the fatalities
6944260 the motor vehicles department should keep in mind that it is their responsibility to root out fake driving lice nces and under age drivers in order to avert accidents its officials should make sure that each and every applicant for licence has proper driving skills
6944261 we see to it that the applicants are from recognised driving schools and no licence is issued without verifying the applications
6944262 we suspect that the fake licences are procured from outside the state we will introduce a mechanism to detect them in an aggressive manner
6944263 as the elections are due in a few months time mr pranab mukherjee is expressing false sympathy towards the gorkhaland demand the hidden agenda is simply to appease the gullible hill people and create a vote bank in the hills
6944264 the congress seems to have two lines on the gorkhaland issue one pursued by mr priya ranjan das munshi and the other by the darjeeling congress mp mr dawa narbula mr mukherjee has added to the confusion the congress should make its stand clear on the issue
6944265 the congress should instruct the union home ministry to withdraw the sixth schedule bill from the parliament before making any promises instead of making vocal assurance their promise towards gorkhaland should also appear in the congress partys national manifesto
6944266 mr narbula is aware of the centres strategy by keeping silent he is playing with fire
6944267 i was told that the mother and the son were fine
6944268 at 8am the hospital staff told me that geeta needed blood when i along with my friends and relatives went to the blood bank we found that it was locked from outside fifteen minutes later the hospital staff told me that my wife had died
6944269 i have given a report to the acting hospital superintendent anup ghosh and i am not going to tell you journalists anything further in this regard
6944270 the preliminary report i have received says the patient died because of cardio respiratory failure after sudden haemorrhage
6944271 but there is a person on the call to open the bank if a need arises
6944272 the nbmch authority has taken no worthwhile initiative to trace him since his disappearance except filing a missing diary with the matigara police station
6944273 we are literally scratching our heads wondering how a jaundice affected patient in a fairly serious condition could have left the hospital unaided we talked to him the morning he went missing and his condition was not good oxygen and drip were being administered simultaneously hospital nurses were present in the ward yet he disappeared and is yet to be traced after three full days
6944274 the apparent unconcern on the part of the hospital authority has further confounded the mystery is filing a missing diary with the police the end of responsibility for the authority can we not expect a modicum of sympathy from them
6944275 the team is well equipped although it may face problems when the water level of the phaskhaowa and chuniajhora rivers that flows thought the reserve increases we set up the camp on the 19th of this month since then there has been no major depredation by the jumbos the camp will continue to be there till the herds move away
6944276 we had left the decision making to the people who supported us those who kept their shops open were had been terrorised into doing it and this is similar to the terror that was seen in the hills during the 1986 gorkhaland agitation
6944277 there is no misunderstanding between the morcha and the cprm over the bandh both the cprm and the morcha want gorkhaland and there is no reason for us to differ
6944278 soon after announcing the strike on august 9 we tried to meet bimal gurung on august 13 and 14 but we could not the morcha has been infiltrated by agents of bengal those opposed to the division of the state who do not want unity this is a black day in the history of gorkha unity the morcha has issued the statement only to save its face
6944279 you are not prepared for what is about to happen but you can handle it
6944280 thats a lot for a young girl like you to handle you seem to be doing pretty good
6944281 half million quit pills for serious conditions in 2007 when faced with cost many people in medicare with diabetes high blood pressure and other chronic conditions stop taking their medicine just check me out over here
6944282 we are surprised to see the double standard of the congress
6944283 on one hand priya ranjan das munshi is saying his party is against further division of the state while on the other the mp from darjeeling is quoting pranab mukherjee who said the congress is not averse to forming smaller states and was toying with the idea of setting up the second state reorganisation commission
6944284 narbula behaving in typical congress manner had escorted the morcha delegation to mukherjee the mp is himself harping on the demand for a separate state despite das munshi clearing his partys stand
6944285 eles iam para suas casas com as roupas contaminadas colocando em risco a vida de seus familiares sem nenhuma orienta o sobre como proceder

6944291 shadowplay cuban intelligence operations in latin america amp the caribbean
6944292 naturally i would never divulge us classified information however i have in my possession declassified us government information only some of which was publically released previously undisclosed eyewitness accounts of espionage associated events also unclassified due to the sources or data provided and information provided to me from cuban intelligence defectors now under us control ergo the material is cuban classified information there is some public domain information thrown in there as well i will divulge no us classified information and the usg has no ongoing or anticipated investigations of those i identify not every spys career ends with an arrest sometimes public awareness is enough
6944293 opportunity to see firsthand just how horrific fidel castro s stronghold on the nation had oppressed and mistreated people
6944294 the second full day in cuba we returned to the same area and delivered the rest of the aid to the local medical facility that the disabled office had suggested this medical facility that the oregonian said didnt exist does in fact exist and is about 8 blocks from that office we toured the area and medical facility met with some of the staff and delivered the aid

6944312 bullshit to your accusation that russia accused of abusing truce
6944313 not in compliance with the ceasefire and that russia needs to come into compliance now
6944314 we havent seen that yet its my understanding that they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
6944315 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
6944316 should go back to the situation before the hostilities started
6944317 the idea is that yes for a temporary period some russian peace forces could stay on next to the border line of ossetia but its temporary it should be for patrolling and it should be until we have an international mechanism
6944318 it was clearly stated that this presence first has to be through patrolling no fixed presence and second should not have an effect on the freedom of movement on roads and trains in this place

6944331 if the shoe is banned why do so many athletes win big marathons wearing them i hope to do the same in beijing
6944332 i am very excited to be the first marathoner in the olympics to wear the spira shoes to me it is an honor
6944333 on the one hand the rules create a chilling effect on our ability to recruit elite athletes to race in the shoes at big events
6944334 on the other hand the controversy provides a platform to tell our unique story
6944335 the shoes are not banned and never have been banned
6944336 we have said that from the moment spira started claiming there was a ban
6944337 but i thought the alleged banned in boston was a little over the top
6944338 the spring does not return more than 100 percent energy its in the mid 90s
6944339 so wheres the unfair advantage its not producing energy the wavespring technology is no different from scientific advances made in other sports like graphite golf clubs and oversized tennis rackets
6944340 the rule is there and i guess if someone wanted to challenge someones victory in our shoes theyd be right but im hoping what will happen now that were having all this success is that theyll change the rule
6944341 they have simply never been banned by us or the iaaf the entire effect of this campaign falsely claiming that the shoes are banned has been to get the shoe lots of publicity its entirely false and has always been false
6944342 oh and notice how the girls dont have their shirts tucked into their jeans
6944343 my dear children lets not just talk about love lets practice real love this is the only way well know were living truly living in gods reality its also the way to shut down debilitating self criticism even when there is something to it for god is greater than our worried hearts and knows more about us than we do ourselves and friends once thats taken care of and were no longer accusing or condemning ourselves were bold and free before god were able to stretch our hands out and receive what we asked for becuase were doing what he said doing what pleases him

6944355 me voy del cargo por respeto a las mujeres y mi compromiso al pa s y porque considero el abuso sexual como un delito grave
6944356 el asunto en el que se le involucra al parecer surgi antes que ortega fuese presidente del vecino pa s es posible que eso sea una presunci n
6944357 mientras un tribunal no lo condene l es inocente aunque ese asunto es importante no es posible que el gobierno hondure o rechace su presencia aqu porque no nos toca juzgarlo y hay que recibirlo con todos los honores de un mandatario
6944358 si ortega tiene un poco de verg enza no debe venir porque l ha sido denunciado como un abusador de la hija de su esposa rosario murillo

6944370 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6944371 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign
6944372 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6944373 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6944374 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking

6944445 we needed to play full speed tackle football and i think we scared ourselves out of playing football thursday
6944446 we threw the pads on again and said were going to play and they got excited and that fired me up they wanted to compete and it was a very crisp workout today was good medicine for everybody
6944447 defensively we gave up some big plays and we would hope that thats not customary for us
6944448 the second run was probably more disappointing because it was just a straight return
6944449 we didnt get our first hit on him until he was at about the 30 yard line

6944461 a policeman was holding up the busy traffic with his white gloved hands
6944462 then came a surprise indeed on the empty street so carefully guarded and protected there walked across looking very proud and clever a mother duck with her ten little ducklings in single file behind her there they waddled all the little necks on a stretch all the little beaks a twitter all the little eyes wide open when they got safely across the big policeman lowered his arm and the waves of traffic surged on once more

6944467 is there a difference between a chart i got online and a consultation with an
6944468 obviously we put the base stuff in the first couple of times we were out and well continue to add stuff to the game plan on both sides of the ball there probably wont be a whole lot of new stuff offensively just different blocking schemes because well see some different fronts than what were used to during fall camp
6944469 weve got to have a greater sense of urgency about preparing for this game a week and a day away
6944470 our concentration needs to improve from tonight but hopefully well look at the film and see some things we can build off of
6944471 it worked out well with the defense getting a stop the first time and the offense going down and getting the points we needed the second time and i saw a little sense of urgency there out of our team
6944472 well go through a script tomorrow work against each other some and work off scout cards to try and give each other a good look
6944473 well try to cover all situations that could occur during a game

6944477 were not out of the picture we have two out of three shots
6944478 this has been delayed for so long and maybe you should not consider putting all your eggs in one basket harper and put the building up for public sale said beutler
6944479 sometimes you have to take a little bit of a hit when you put it up on the market but it would put it back on the tax rolls
6944480 regardless that is still a good amount and we have been losing this revenue for the last five 5 years
6944481 arent we putting the cart before the horse talking about selling a building without deeming it surplus or getting it appraised
6944482 its not an easy fix if the board decides to sell it finds a place to store the materials then well get an appraiser to tell us what its worth
6944483 dont we then have to advertise the sale of the building
6944484 these are just preliminary talks it may happen that if it goes to bid harper could be outbid
6944485 we have road pavers in there over the winter time plows stored in the summer some vehicles and detectives in the facility
6944486 its a lot nicer building in the office area than in the police facility on pavement road

6944491 theres no question theres a variety of suggestions that people are in fact returning
6944492 remittances which is the money immigrants send home to mexico have gone down dramatically over the past year again probably part the economy but also part enforcement leading to fewer people being here
6944493 a visitor could have a wonderful time here a great meal and a great stay but they are going to leave us with a bad impression if they cant take a shower and brush their teeth because brown sludge is coming from the taps
6944494 i want the town to come out here measure how much this is costing and reimburse us
6944495 but all they do is give us a little pack of iron out and send us away
6944496 i have a theory guests remember two things about their stay how good the coffee was and how clean the washrooms were its pretty hard to make coffee using bottled water when you have a dining room filled with 30 people

6944501 youre really good friends you two this isnt a major thing this is a minor thing for darnell compared with whats going on in his head you guys will be fine
6944502 either way ill see a positive but thats the way i think
6944503 im staying in here tonight it seems too stressful in there
6944504 when i came on council it was 2 13 and trentonworks was still up and running so we were still getting tax money from there i figure anything over the 2 mark was too much so we worked to get it down
6944505 were barely able to maintain things at 1 99 now that trentonworks is closed
6944506 if youre going to offer services to convince someone to move in town from the county where its got a lower residential rate youd better be able to provide great service and keep taxes at a low level i dont know how the other towns do it other than having a bigger commercial tax base to draw from it
6944507 no one was expecting their oil bill to double and the price of asphalt doubled as well some people argue that we shouldnt have paved because of that since our roads were in really good shape but we believe its cheaper to maintain our roads than repair a job that should really have been done before
6944508 we have some of the finest schools as well and one offsets the other
6944509 we just cant seem to get anybody in here to increase the tax base
6944510 all the new big industry canadian tire walmart and everything else is moving to new glasgow or the county we just cant seem to land anything and its not for lack of trying
6944511 its all government downloading they find an ingenious way to get more money out of you all the time
6944512 its hard and i dont know whats going to happen
6944513 slowly but surely theyre forcing amalgamation when towns have such a hard time making ends meet
6944514 people are building closer to the towns and using their services but living outside the town and taking advantage of the lower tax rate
6944515 theyre very pleased to be getting a rate lower than theyd been getting where they were
6944516 we take everyones different situations into consideration were there to represent the people and theyre 100 per cent on our minds when we do the budgets
6944517 we hear a lot of surprise from people who are coming in here and finding the tax rates are a lot higher from where they left
6944518 we have to use the new assessment when we list the house that shows what its replacement value is
6944519 the residential assessment is capped so we dont get taxed to death but the capped rate disappears if the house is listed and the new rate is higher to reflect market value
6944520 in my life i make friends with these people and these people
6944521 i put them together and we end up not friends anymore
6944522 its like when someone says youre their top person but you dont get that feeling

6944601 the scribes and the pharisees sit on moses seat 3 so practice and observe whatever they tell you but not what they do for they preach but do not practice 4 they bind heavy burdens hard to bear and lay them on mens shoulders but they themselves will not move them with their finger 5 they do all their deeds to be seen by men for they make their phylacteries broad and their fringes long 6 and they love the place of honor at feasts and the best seats in the synagogues 7 and salutations in the market places and being called rabbi by men 8 but you are not to be called rabbi for you have one teacher and you are all brethren 9 and call no man your father on earth for you have one father who is in heaven 10 neither be called masters for you have one master the christ 11 he who is greatest among you shall be your servant 12 whoever exalts himself will be humbled and whoever humbles himself will be exalted

6944604 these considerations are in line with the great traditions of the church and they all strengthen our fervor with regard to christ the teacher who reveals god to man and man to himself the teacher who saves sanctifies and guides who lives who speaks rouses moves redresses judges forgives and goes with us day by day on the path of history the teacher who comes and will come in glory
6944605 he who is the greatest among you shall be your servant
6944606 god opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble

6944636 a family interested in a bunny can have a wonderful time with the bunny
6944637 you never want to adopt a bunny for a child because its a lot of work its a lot to ask of a child too much to ask of a child however a family working together participating in the care of the animal just like a dog or a cat it can be terrific theyre great

6944642 sometimes you do tests that turn out not to be positive
6944643 you have a positive test you have the information that you need once theres a health risk assessment done by health canada we go forward with the recall
6944644 what is really needed in my perspective is a full blown inquiry on what is happening to the food inspection business in this country
6944645 inspecting the products before they make it to the stores before people can actually purchase them those are the audits that arent being made those are the audits that arent being made because theyre too short staffed

6944677 so i would never dissuade anybody a physician in particular from suspecting marfan syndrome
6944678 but if thats all there was the likelihood would be relatively low
6944679 the enlargement of the aorta can be present before birth or during childhood
6944680 but in an adult male if he had marfan syndrome it would be present and if they were looking for the disease they would have detected the enlarged aorta already im sure michael phelps had an echocardiogram already and then he probably wouldnt be swimming since physical activity is restricted
6944681 hyman had been checked countless times for college for the olympics and no one suspected marfan syndrome
6944682 how do you pronounce your name its spelled funny and i cant figure it out
6944683 whys your name spelled funny seems kind of gay i bet your mom gave you that name huh kids made fun of you in school i was lucky my mom named me dennis
6944684 id like to close my account please and i was told you would be able to help me with that but if its more than your red neck hill billy southern loving confederate flag waving bud light drinking inbred brain can handle just say so now and ill have someone else help me
6944685 dennis if i was to answer that question for you not only would it involve extensive flow charts a national panel of past and present disgruntled customers and a hardy fuck right up your ass without the benefit of lube so you could see what its like dealing with this bank but you wouldnt understand any of it anyway do you know why that is
6944686 because dennis unlike the rest of the good folks who migrated here from the northern states you represent a growing minority of uneducated christian zealots who when faced with the real world and its often times ungodly realities fall back on an archaic form of good old fashioned social networking wherein the good old boys help one another out despite severe genetic and mental deficiencies which one of your uncles owns this bank dennis
6944687 all right but there will be substantial fees and fines due to the fact that you havent had the account open for more than fifty years according to our records this will over draw your account by four dollars to which there will of course be attached an additional two hundred and fifty dollars for every dollar you are over drawn add that up and you will owe us a total of one thousand dollars to close your account if you cant pay it all right now thats fine we have excellent payment plans available though with your credit score the interest on our most flexible plan is pretty severe at the rate we can offer youll be paying us back for the next seventy five years so how would you like to make your first payment keep in mind we cant accept personal checks

6944737 while senator mccain continues to offer unconditional military and economic support for iraq i strongly believe that we need to use our leverage with the iraqi government to ensure a political settlement
6944738 conditions based withdrawals of us troops are the precise opposite course of that advocated by
6944739 i am glad the administration has finally shifted to accepting a timetable for the removal of our combat troops from iraq
6944740 success in iraq depends on an iraqi government that is reconciling its differences and taking responsibility for its future and a timetable is the best way to press the iraqis to do just that
6944741 i welcome the growing convergence around this pragmatic and responsible position

6944755 plans to plead guilty friday to a reduced charge of desertion his lawyer said
6944756 branum said long has reached an agreement with prosecutors to plead guilty to desertion with intent to remain away permanently a lesser charge than desertion with intent to shirk hazardous duty
6944757 in exchange for him pleading guilty theyve agreed to lower the three year maximum sentence that usually comes with those charges
6944758 i think they want to prosecute him for free speech issues without actually charging him for them

6944768 just this morning us and iraqi negotiators announced theyve reached a deal to withdraw us troops from iraq
6944769 im sure that this will be approved by the parliament as soon as they come back from vacation and they get their act together
6944770 a draft agreement between the united states and iraq contains no fixed dates for u s forces to withdraw but iraq would like combat troops out by the end of 2011 government spokesman ali al dabbagh said on thursday
6944771 if the council agrees to the draft it will move to the political council for national security before going to the iraqi parliament which must approve the agreement before the u n mandate expires
6944772 towards the end of july after a secure video conference between president bush and prime minister maliki we announced that as part of any agreement with the iraqis establishing our future bilateral releationship would include aspirational time horizons goals for women iraqi troops begin to take over more of the combat mission in various parts of iraq which allow for more us troops to come home so any discussions that are ongoing that we are having with the iraqis right now include these aspirational timelines these goals for more troops to come home
6944773 the shiite domination government in iraq is driving out many leaders of sunni citizen patrols the groups of former insurgents who joined the american payroll and have been a major pillar in the decline in violence around the nation
6944774 these people are like cancer and we must remove them
6944775 like a drug addict who quits only to take drugs again
6944776 were not going to walk away from them and as i said prime minister maliki committed to taking care of them i do think it is somewhat understandable that the government struggles to hire former insurgents for its security forces or for its ministerial positions but this is how you end these kinds of conflicts thats why they call it reconciliation its not done with ones friends its done with former enemies
6944777 we cannot stand them and we detained many of them recently
6944778 because he was deemed not to be a security threat

6944780 explores the human side of globalization exposing the many ways it uproots people in latin american and asia driving them to migrate at the same time u s immigration policy makes the labor of those displaced people a crime in the united states illegal people explains why our national policy produces even more displacement more migration more immigration raids and a more divided polarized society
6944781 at least level with your readers mr herbert tell them that you think the two major parties republican and democrat own all the voters and theres no one else on the ballot at least level with them
6944782 here is the truth fighting a war without end will not force the iraqis to take responsibility for their own future and fighting in a war without end will not make the american people safer so when i am commander in chief i will set a new goal on day one i will end this war not because politics compels it not because our troops cannot bear the burden as heavy as it is but because it is the right thing to do for our national security and it will ultimately make us safer

6944788 i would not want to comment on that i guess that would depend on how the conversation is going between the officer that pulled over the motorist and the motorist the attitude

6944808 stanford tried to go down the field quite often against us i know jim will want to run the ball also i dont think theyll stay status quo with what they did offensively well see some wrinkles in the first game that we just have to be sound against and adjust to on the sidelines

6944826 perhaps real world climate sensitivity is very much below the ipccs estimates perhaps therefore there is no climate crisis at all the correct policy approach to a non problem is to have the courage to do nothing
6944827 i was impressed by an hour long academic lecture which criticized claims about global warming and explained the implications of the physics of radiative transfer for climate change
6944828 to me the value of this paper lies in its dispassionate but ruthlessly clear exposition or rather expos of the ipccs method of evaluating climate sensitivity the detailed arguments in this paper and indeed in a large number of other scientific papers point up extensive errors including numerous projection errors of climate models as well as misleading statements by the ipcc consequently there are no rational grounds for believing either the ipcc or any other claims of dangerous anthropogenic global warming
6944829 was 0 3 f cooler than the 1901 2000 average
6944830 its not ice melt but rather wind circulation that drives ocean currents northward from the tropics climate models until now have not properly accounted for the winds effects on ocean circulation so researchers have compensated by over emphasizing the role of man made warming on polar ice melt
6944831 i will make a commitment that al gore will be at the table and play a central part in us figuring out how we solve this problem hes somebody i talk to on a regular basis im already consulting with him in terms of these issues but climate change is real

6944853 our clients were picked up by one of the largest casino operations in the world for a free flight and weekend of fun but instead they encountered an entirely avoidable commercial bus crash which we believe is due to the defendants transport of passengers in a poorly maintained and manufactured vehicle since august 1 2008 we have seen four commercial bus crashes nationwide two of which were fatal something has to change
6944854 bus and motor coach safety is mandated by federal regulation however the individual carrier has additional responsibilities to take all necessary measures to provide for the safe travel of its passengers in the instance of this crash harrahs failed on both counts the responsible parties violated several federally mandated regulations and made no effort to provide any additional safety precautions we believe these particular failures led to the injury and death of innocent individuals

6944859 im sure all of us know a little bit of blond jokes from time to time most of them deal with misunderstandings mainly because theres this stereotype that blonds are dumbs therefore theyre ignorant and thus you can tell them anything and theyll mistake it for something else or theyll just fall for it right then and there

6944904 the incubator of personalities that later lead muslim society to extremism and violence
6944905 im not too concerned about it just go out and try and be productive try and get some hits and drive in some runs so the big guys dont always have to feel like they have to carry us the bottom of the order is capable of putting the ball in play and doing some damage as well
6944906 it means the guys in front of me are having great years theyre constantly on base ive been saying that ive been batting eighth and found myself coming up many many times with the bases loaded batting seventh and coming up with second and third with less than two out i went through that rough stretch in july where i felt i didnt help the team at all
6944907 its one of those things when youre going good you dont want to talk about it just forget about it and play
6944908 you can talk to the hitting coach about his swing or talk to derrek he hasnt hit the ball for power but hes been getting his basehits i dont have an explanation for it
6944909 i havent hit a home run in awhile especially in the second half
6944910 were winning baseball games so i try to keep my concerns on that were playing so good that who really cares about your stats
6944911 we are proud to support the efforts of our players wives to help the lakeview pantry and its tremendous work in our community
6944912 the cubs wives food drive is an essential component in lakeview pantrys ability to get food to those in need in our community
6944913 not only is it our largest annual food drive but it comes in late summer when many other sources of food are becoming scarce
6944914 im just trying to buy as much time as possible
6944915 i had more bat tosses into the stands than hits
6944916 the biggest thing for me was going out there every day there were no setbacks no feelings of dizziness or loopiness or anything like that i just kept progressing every day
6944917 i knew i was going to come back i just didnt know when there was a plan and we stuck to it hopefully its over with and i wont have to deal with this type of injury again
6944918 if we can get what we had in the first part of the year itll be a great addition to our lineup and to our defense as well
6944919 its all going to come i just need to be a piece
6944920 jerrys going to look after me and give me some time to get my legs back and settle in
6944921 im still going to go in hard dont get me wrong but you might see my hands up a little higher
6944922 im not worried about that it happens in baseball if theyre going to be in there coming up high and tight ill take it hopefully it hits my elbow and not my head
6944923 well wait to see how he does today and then well go from there
6944924 it was literally resistant to every meaningful antibiotic that we had
6944925 so we had this report and i looked at it and said to myself my god this is an organism that basically we cant treat
6944926 they were very effectively moving the organism from one bed to the next
6944927 is that you take a capable micro rganism like klebsiella and you put it through the gruelling test of being exposed to a broad spectrum of antibiotics and it will eventually defeat your efforts as this one did
6944928 virtually all cases of mrsa were either in hospitals or nursing homes in the hospital setting they cause wound infections after surgery pneumonias and bloodstream infections from indwelling catheters but they can cause a variety of other infections all the way to bacterial meningitis
6944929 and then it started showing up in men who have sex with men
6944930 soon it began to be spread in prisons among the prisoners now we see it in a whole bunch of other populations
6944931 there are about a dozen new antibiotics coming on the market in the next couple of years
6944932 but there are no good drugs coming along for these gram negatives
6944933 the klebsiella that caused particular trouble in new york are spreading out
6944934 they have very high mortality rates they are sort of the doomsday scenario bugs
6944935 i was really interested to see whether we could find an antibiotic resistant population of bacteria in a place that had never seen antibiotics
6944936 they were at the time thought to be drugs of last resort because they had activity against a whole variety of multiply resistant gram negative bacteria that were already floating around
6944937 its a big problem and its contaminated the evacuation facilities in germany and a lot of the v a hospitals in the united states where these soldiers have been brought
6944938 seventy per cent of the antibiotics administered in america end up in agriculture
6944939 the drugs are not used to cure sick animals but to prevent them from getting sick because we crowd them together under filthy circumstances these are perfect environments for disease and we also have found for reasons that i dont think we entirely understand that administering low levels of antibiotics to animals speeds their growth
6944940 believes that prudent drug use principles are essential to the control of antimicrobial resistance
6944941 antibiotics and antibiotic resistant bacteria arb are found in the air and soil around farms in surface and ground water in wild animal populations and on retail meat and poultry arb are carried into the kitchen on contaminated meat and poultry where other foods are cross contaminated because of common unsafe handling practices
6944942 the problem is that we have created the perfect environment in which to breed superbugs that are antibiotic resistant
6944943 weve created a petri dish in our factory farms for the evolution of dangerous pathogens
6944944 bad bugs no drugs as antibiotic discovery stagnates a public health crisis brews
6944945 most people would say that efflux is the most common form of bacterial resistance to antibiotics
6944946 this has been a problem in mediterranean europe that started about ten years ago
6944947 it started to get really serious during the last five or six years and has become really dramatic in greece
6944948 there are now a growing number of reports of cases of infections caused by gram negative organisms for which no adequate therapeutic options exist
6944949 this return to the preantibiotic era has become a reality in many parts of the world
6944950 anytime you hear about some kid getting snatched you want to find something in that story that will convince you that that family is different from yours
6944951 but the problem is that any of us could be an i c u patient tomorrow its not easy to convey this to people if its not immediately a threat you dont want to think about it but its actually anybody who goes into a hospital this is scary stuff
6944952 they developed a huge number of important anti microbial agents they had incredible chemistry and incredible research facilities and unfortunately they have completely pulled out of it now after squibb merged with bristol myers they closed their antibacterial program
6944953 fda approval of new antibacterial agents decreased by 56 per cent over the past 20 years 1998 2002 vs 1983 1987
6944954 antibiotics are the only class of drugs where all the experts as soon as you introduce them clinically we go out and tell everyone to try to hold it in reserve
6944955 if there is a new cardiology drug every cardiologist out there is saying that everyone deserves to be on it
6944956 the big picture did not receive the attention it deserved
6944957 as loud as my voice might be there are louder voices screaming
6944958 the difficulty that we are faced with is that our budget has been flat for the last five years
6944959 in real dollars weve lost almost fifteen per cent purchasing power
6944960 the problem is it is extremely difficult to do a prospective controlled trial because when people come into the hospital they immediately get started on some treatment which ruins the period of study
6944961 the culture of american medicine makes a study like that more difficult to execute
6944962 of course its only around ten million people so its possible to intervene because everything is smaller
6944963 maybe swedes are more used to this type of intervention and regulation
6944964 you are probably going to have to screen millions of compounds and you cant screen millions of infected mice
6944965 so our approach was to find an alternative host that could be infected with human pathogens which was small enough and cheap enough to be used in drug screens whats remarkable is that many common human pathogens including staphylococcus and pseudomonas will cause intestinal infection and kill the worms so now you can look for a compound that cures it that prevents the pathogen from killing the host
6944966 bacteria dont want to alert their host that they are there by immediately producing virulence factors which the host would recognize
6944967 when they reach a certain quorum there are too many of them for the host to do anything about it
6944968 its a great idea but so far nobody has been able to make it work for human infections

6944970 you are miles high and alone the words you got a clean shutdown are most agreeable
6944971 since the rocket motors consume a copious amount of fuel the take off and initial climb gross weight is very heavy
6944972 once the take off initial climb angle and airspeed are obtained the ride gets better and better steeper and faster the thrust on your back lets you know you are getting with the programme
6944973 but its less challenging than performing a full up mission in a fighter type aircraft
6944974 so many things that go into a race vehicle end up in your car

6945107 it was reasonable earlier in the year but in finals footy every little bit counts its a game of inches and we cant afford to relax like we did tonight
6945108 our execution early was poor but i thought our effort was good
6945109 i was pleased with that and i thought our energy levels were good and we broke the game open once we started to make the passes and hit the targets like we should
6945110 hes been very special i actually wanted to take him out in the sixth inning but he pleaded begged told me hed be ok he said i cant come out of this game i said ok go get em and he went out and got em
6945111 i told that i felt good that i just wanted to stay out there
6945112 i told him i dont want to come out of the game before roy

6945127 i would say it probably would have been to our advantage to get bobby abreu out and we didnt do that i thought the key to the game was we didnt get abreu out at all he doesnt chase bad pitches and thats probably why hes the great hitter he is
6945128 i thought his velocity was good and he threw a couple of good sliders but too many pitches were up with the exception on sarfate and cherry we didnt get in on them and we got some pitches up
6945129 weve done our homework on him early in the game you have to make him throw the ball over the plate because he can expand the strike zone hes a master at hitting his spots and changing speeds

6945167 the two agreed that russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
6945168 we havent seen that yet its my understanding that they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
6945169 have without a doubt failed to live up to their obligations

6945183 isnt matrixsynth better than a big cuppa cocoa amp a christmas cookie on a cold cold southern california morning
6945184 i think that the matrixsynth blog is great and keeps people well in touch with everything synth i visit everyday to see whats going on
6945185 its going to take some imagination and creativity and doing business differently
6945186 i dont want to ask for a tax increase and i dont want to impose any new fees in this economic environment on business and residents who are already paying the bills i would rather cut back just like theyre cutting back
6945187 although we have seen improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force
6945188 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
6945189 they wont act until the coast is clear on financial stability and the state of the economy
6945190 such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered
6945191 some caution is in order however as this more comprehensive approach would be technically demanding and possibly very costly both for the regulators and the firms they supervise

6945196 i would have been seven years old i remember staying up past my bedtime on election night which was a big deal those days
6945197 and i think the prospect of having politicians continuing to profit while hoosier taxpayers continue to pay is simply wrong
6945198 because i believe so strongly that we must take indiana values to washington
6945199 two three year olds on the campaign trail sounds a little mind boggling
6945200 when do we get to go out at night again
6945201 we didnt get a penalty probably from the 35th minute mark and i didnt see much of a change in the tempo of the game the way we were playing
6945202 we sit there and watch and go through the heartbreak but theyre the ones feeling the pain and when you lose like that the pain is a lot worse
6945203 im just happy to get the two points i would have been happy to take one point
6945204 the thing i liked about tonight was the way a lot of little things clicked for us and certain players
6945205 david stagg was back doing all the little things he hasnt been doing for a little while ashton sims had his best running game and ben hannant was streets above where he has been for a couple of weeks
6945206 i saw a whole lot of little things with different players to give me a bit of confidence going forward

6945209 obamas political career was launched in ayers home and the two served together on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
6945210 we didnt get a penalty probably from the 35th minute mark and i didnt see much of a change in the tempo of the game the way we were playing
6945211 we sit there and watch and go through the heartbreak but theyre the ones feeling the pain and when you lose like that the pain is a lot worse

6945215 i saw a whole lot of little things with different players to give me a bit of confidence going forward
6945216 we have a number of players like michael ennis corey parker darren lockyer and karmichael hunt who have been pretty consistent most of the season but the other guys started to kick in and i thought they were the little things you look for
6945217 the first two engine companies arrived right there on ridgecrest and stopped the fire from spreading to seven eight nine 10 houses engine 10 went to melody to protect exposure so nothing spread from ridgecrest down
6945218 were really thrilled to be the school chosen to be the prototype
6945219 so far ill tell you what the children were so excited the first day coming back just to see things that work again
6945220 i think our kids all deserve equal or at least similar opportunities
6945221 well never have an older school be equitable to a newer school but we can sure do better than what were doing now
6945222 weve never completely gutted a school like we did this one
6945223 the interactive white boards that we have in every class that is changing the way we instruct students
6945224 i think its going to have some really academic affects on the children
6945225 every little bit that we get for our students they come in the next day and they think its the best thing theyve ever seen
6945226 thats how we are getting new carpet because its in such bad shape it just cant be there anymore
6945227 the three smart boards that we have are used constantly
6945228 but three white boards in the entire school is just a small drop in the bucket compared to what we need

6945237 a lanky fellow who filmed every move for some mad purpose of his own this was of course the much mocked dad richard williams he should be celebrated as the tennis genius of our age
6945238 that one world class player should emerge from the cracked public tennis courts of compton is remarkable that two should do so and from the same family is little short of a miracle
6945239 a lot of people forget theres no such thing as unanimous support in any body you represent but from a results standpoint what more could you want the retired players some of them are getting four times what they would have gotten if gene hadnt been there the stuff about being too close to paul tagliabue id like to have anyone explain to me how the players havent been served by gene the owners just opted out of this labor deal because it was such a bad deal for them and such a good deal for the players
6945240 it seems to be more consistent with what we want to have happen to keep it from being influenced
6945241 this is better than an all star team because everybody is sacrificing what he does for his nba team for the good of this team theres a huge difference between stars trying to fulfill roles and role players fulfilling roles tyson chandler knows hes not in there to shoot
6945242 at wah lok had fresh succulent prawns contained by the thinly light skin
6945243 save jersey is quickly becoming one of new jerseys premier blogs
6945244 we want cleveland for our own reasons we dont think they can beat us in the playoffs three straight years its hard to beat a team three straight we want to try our luck
6945245 chill out and worry about other things dont worry about the washington wizards are we really going to listen to a guy who said yao ming would not be an all star in this league so who cares what he has to say
6945246 lets toss it up and see if you can walk the walk like you talk the talk
6945247 all the talk all the silliness had gotten so much attention it was time to j us t play ball
6945248 we were down 3 1 on the brink of elimination i just told them that all this talking was not making them look bad it was making us look bad were a veteran team and it was time for us to start acting like it
6945249 dont get me wrong i love d steve and i love gil and ill strap it up with them anytime you have to have your teammates backs but what was going on was just nonsense it had nothing to do with getting respect because you can only do that by playing well and demonstrating professionalism you make your noise that way
6945250 we dodged a bullet in the end we finally get a miss
6945251 would love people talking about the celtics about them being deep in the playoffs again
6945252 he would love being back in the national dialogue he would love people talking about the celtics about them being deep in the playoffs again
6945253 red youre at it again hes still in there he doesnt like the pregame noise and he doesnt like the new cheerleaders but he would change with the times just like he did with no cut contracts and going from car to train travel he was always a step ahead arnolds spirit will forever be with the boston celtics no matter who owns the team no matter whos on the floor
6945254 kept him alive when the new owners bought the team they told him red we want you up here as much as possible all you need to know is that when the city of boston passed a no smoking ordinance in public buildings they included a clause that made an exception for red smoking cigars at celtics games everybody knew he was in the building
6945255 when he walked to his seat in the 1970s even after retiring from coaching he still had the fire and physicality of a young man and the occasional rage
6945256 i can see him going out onto the floor and grabbing billy cunningham the philly star then coach and in the later years he was getting to his seat with his cane but that spirit and that fire was always there
6945257 red didnt like laimbeer and what isiah thomas said about bird the infamous comment that if bird was black hed be just another player ticked him off because he hated when smart guys said dumb things he loved nothing more than when bird stole the ball from isiah he got a kick out of that
6945258 i think personally its been tougher than anything ive ever seen
6945259 the wear and tear of the nba game on the body of a player you only have to watch me walk out to the court to understand that is probably like putting ten years into one year of a normal human beings body because of the grind of this game so the rest and recuperation they can get in the offseason is really important for the players but weve joined world basketball in this cause to chase whatever whatever it means to the nba to have our game worldwide and to notify the rest of the world how good our teams are in the usa
6945260 weve tried to chase the gold in the olympics and the world cup
6945261 i just think were taking some of our best players and putting them in positions where its tough for them to continue to play
6945262 i dont think they abuse their bodies during the olympics period it is extra basketball but thats the reality of it the olympics have helped the nba the globalization of basketball our coaches and our players the reality is it remains an extraordinary stage and the basketball ticket in beijing will be the number one ticket in the sport
6945263 ive said it before and i will say it again the nba is making a huge mistake by letting our players participate in the olympics and its qualifying competitions
6945264 unfortunately for the nba this is the only place where we give away our trademark and assets and we shouldnt if the game of basketball truly has grown to the level of interest we all think and hope it has then we should just dump playing for the olympics and hold our own tournament if we were really really smart we would work with the nhl nfl mlb and usa track amp field organizations tennis and other sports with strong professional bases and create our own games then supporting the international development of the games would make sense
6945265 it definitely takes a toll on your body and as guys get older it becomes more difficult to play all year but youve got a lot of issues here as americans we have such egos when it comes to international basketball me i wouldnt have it any other way than nba players representing the u s the other countries are putting their best players on the floor which now means professionals so we need to put our best on the floor the process probably is an issue with the qualifying but if youre asking me if we should use amateurs the answer is no no i am in favor of having the teams determined by essentially open tryouts put the 12 best on the floor not the 12 hottest nba players at the moment
6945266 the issue if were talking about health starts with qualifying if these guys stop messing around and go ahead and win the gold medal they wont have to take more than three weeks to a month out of their lives a month of playing other great players in the olympics is good preparation for the next season but if you dont win gold or youre not the host nation then it can take two years of playing and practicing to qualify and that takes the big physical toll it takes more out of you physically to do all the stuff to qualify than it does to play six games or whatever you need to win to win the gold
6945267 there are some interesting arguments on both sides but i think the answer depends totally on whether we want to win or not
6945268 it depends on what it means to the nba and to the united states to win a gold medal im telling you right now that if its important you have to have pros you cant put a bunch of college kids out there and expect them to beat gin bili andr s nocioni and luis scola of argentina those guys would kill a team of college kids
6945269 what pretty much got me started in basketball growing up in los angeles was watching the lakers and the celtics
6945270 and its ironic just being a celtic growing up now youre playing against the lakers in the finals as a kid i hated the celtics im going back home to play against my team that i grew up watching its a dream come true just thinking about it i think that rivalry really revolutionized the game of basketball and now im part of it
6945271 that big plate of food in front of me watching the lakers and celtics play on sunday hubie brown and dick stockton doing the games i remember that like it was yesterday fire going mom telling me dont get too close to the tv itll kill your eyes im looking forward to this
6945272 somebody asked me in the beginning of the year what it was like to be part of
6945273 lemme give you this car now so in turn youll feel obligated to let me get close to you before the big payday down the road
6945274 he was working for some agents talking about what they can do for me and what i need he seemed like he had my best interests at heart hed be at my practices hed come over to my house just being around him spending time with him he won my trust
6945275 youve got to watch out for snakes the people who try to steer you toward others so they can make money
6945276 if you come with us we can help your mom brothers and sister with whatever they need thats all i cared about
6945277 i didnt know the rules then and of course they didnt explain it they wanted me to sign something saying theyd represent me after college
6945278 yo dog ill be coming to play for you in the fall and dont worry about recruiting cuz ill be taking care of that too
6945279 i would just love for you to spend some time with me just talking could i have your card and just be able to call or talk to you ive got the pre draft camp in chicago coming up a whole new world
6945280 on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
6945281 by the time i met him he is a professor of education at the university of illinois we served on a board together that had republicans bankers lawyers focused on education
6945282 thats why i didnt get ahead of myself thats why i never got all excited don nelson always said that 99 9 percent of the deals that are discussed never happen everybody thought this was a done deal and it wasnt
6945283 is a great guy hes a pro i like devean george a lot i think the world of him if im involved in a real estate deal i listen to the lawyer who is working on my behalf devean is listening to his agent
6945284 ill be in my room getting some rest at night but during the daytime theyll have a lot of things to keep me busy and i plan on taking part in all of it
6945285 im just going to do everything possible to enjoy the experience
6945286 i spent this whole week demoralizing my opponents because i was playing really well and they just didnt have a chance and sunday i was the one who was demoralized because i didnt have a chance
6945287 i think this certainly is the best stretch ive ever played
6945288 thats my intent thats why you play if you dont believe you can win an event dont show up
6945289 does shaq have any gas left in the tank i think you guys have debated it for 24 hours and come up with no and i think youre wrong i do not think hes going to come to phoenix and lay an egg hes focused and ready to roll and he wants to show the world and all the pundits that this is a great trade

6945295 eating tomato salad again this week with my fingers i kinda dig it its all hippie and groovy
6945296 you know bill wont let us get into that stuff
6945297 donte randy wes welker weve been playing pretty well in all the facets of the game
6945298 but the guys on offense have been holding the ball for six seven minutes consistently were pretty fresh as a result
6945299 its been hard for anybody to laugh or have some fun
6945300 hopefully with rest its not torn or anything but it is an mcl and hopefully with rest ill be fine
6945301 obviously with tomlinson in there it is truly run or pass you never really know from a defensive standpoint you certainly have to be more choosy with plays if its turner and sproles whereas with tomlinson any play can go i think it was just a matter of execution we had chances a couple of times but we just didnt get it done
6945302 of course we worked on turner and sproles all week in practice they have great depth at that position and you saw those guys made great plays last week in beating the colts tomlinson is a great player and theres no question about his ability and the things he can do
6945303 but we were prepared to defend all of them today
6945304 thats the stupidest thing you could ask the guy was not able to go the doctors and trainers said he couldnt go
6945305 the patriots might not be in a class by themselves but it dont take long to call the roll
6945306 as bad as ive started off im still better than 97 percent of the players that are playing right now
6945307 colts may be only hope to stop americas new villain
6945308 i dont want to slight either guy but theres something about brady he wins and it looks so effortless peyton plays out of his mind but if victories and championships are the bottom line tom is so clutch and so calm in the clutch time and again not that peyton isnt peyton produces so much volume its two pure passers theyre both unstoppable forces
6945309 every team in the league except the colts and patriots would take either one of the two
6945310 if youre asking me who i think is harder to defend i think its peyton he does so many subtle things hes always moving safeties with his eyes with a nod or shift hell make a slight motion while dropping back on his third step knowing all the time hes not going to throw the ball until his fifth step or seventh step having said that brady impresses me by what he does off the field never talking about himself or what hes done always talking about the team and about getting better when you think about the patriots you think of bill belichick and his system when you think about the colts its peyton manning not tony dungy or the system but peyton manning
6945311 i seriously questioned the wisdom of going with brady over drew bledsoe when belichick made the switch
6945312 i remember thinking tom who of course i very quickly saw how wrong i was you know how great you have to be to be compared to joe montana how good you have to be as a leader
6945313 joe thrives under stressful times irregular times when its not normal hes at his best
6945314 i dont want to be insensitive but atlanta lost one player michael vick and the entire program collapsed not only did the redskins have a player die during a season which is unthinkable but look at all the other things that have happened that would derail most teams
6945315 they lost the guys who were supposed to be the right side of the offensive line jon jansen and randy thomas essentially for the entire season shawn springss father is in a coma and hes traveling back and forth to see his dad youve got a free agent rookie stephon heyer starting at right guard youve got the whole team flying to a funeral and playing the bears three days later youve got your franchise quarterback going down in that very game then youve got the backup quarterbacks wife giving birth on the eve of his first start in 10 years then coming out and going 0 for 8 but steadying himself to win the game its a movie we cant imagine how difficult it is to manage all that but joe knows how to manage in the chaos go all the way back to his 0 5 start in his very first season as head coach that was so chaotic but he believed even if you dont believe initially he does and he just doesnt waver
6945316 and i think he has a way of imposing his belief whether youre a believer or not or you think you are or not he has you believing in something larger than yourself
6945317 98 99 percent of the team was practicing every day i mean we were having real practices ones where we were running the offense hell we didnt play for more than 50 days and were out there with joe theismann running plays guys were lifting fanatically and remember in the 1987 strike the cowboys had guys like tony dorsett and danny white crossing the picket lines joe told the guys to stay together and nobody crossed the picket line
6945318 joe said to us this is out of my hands guys youve got to stay together and its the culture he has created in and around the team that leads guys to do just what he asks especially when youve got crazy stuff going on all around you i think the redskins were the only team that didnt have a guy cross the picket line
6945319 it helps the team feel a certain confidence when things are going badly he says at the beginning of every training camp the most important job i have is choosing the right people joe really is a collector of people a collector of good people hed have to be to get through something like this nobody prepares for the death of a 24 year old i cant fathom a teammate being shot and killed during the season when i was playing it has to be so easy to wallow in pity
6945320 drank the kool aid most teams facing what this team has faced are done way done
6945321 i hope the commissioner is just as harsh on management as hes been on individual players for making mistakes
6945322 hopefully the penalty will be stiff enough that no one else will try it

6945346 he has the kind of goals in mind that we have not just for our state but for our nation and our world and of course with that kind of confidence hoosiers have he would be a strong running mate for obama and as a democrat we look very favorably on that

6945348 bayh is a well liked individual and i think hed bring popularity to the ticket
6945349 that could be seen as an olive branch to them that would bring some of the disaffected clinton supporters back into the obama camp

6945358 graduation was held at the grand theater the evening of may 31 there had been a lot of discussion about what the girls should wear some wanting expensive dresses and no flowers while others thought that dresses for which the materials were not more than five dollars would be best with each girl carrying red roses which were plentiful and cheap one of zeldas classmates lucy goldthwaite said none of us had too much money in those days in the south and our vote was finally for the five dollar dresses with flowers a few of the girls were disappointed but in an era when store bought clothes were scarce everyone set about getting their seamstresses to make the prettiest dresses possible within the five dollar limit that evening as they gathered behind the stage for the procession zelda turned up in a magnificent white silk dress with a tunic of chiffon floating over it and a large brimmed hat with long streamers down her back you cant imagine how lovely she was lucy said but of course we were all shocked and some of us were resentful i mean it wasnt fair no one knows why zelda ignored the five dollar rule or whether she had told her mother who had undoubtedly made the costume about it but everyone agreed that it was just like her

6945366 frank bonnin was not terminated by smalltownpapers he informed us prior to his five week military training event that he was leaving our company immediately to pursue other business interests with another former employee
6945367 his voluntary departure simply had nothing at all to do with his military training but rather with a personal decision to work elsewhere
6945368 the training referenced in the complaint was supplemental training for a promotion which i repeatedly encouraged frank to pursue
6945369 it happened that prior to the scheduled military training bonnin became disgruntled that the company hired an outside executive to oversee all external relationships frank felt he should have been offered that position and subsequently informed me he was resigning to pursue a new business opportunity months later he returned demanding that he be rehired

6945391 if someone is arrogant it is because they have exchanged some humility for confidence if someone is self doubting it is because they have exchanged some confidence for humility
6945392 james is he out there is it silly for me to know that tetsu who is thousands of miles away can look at this same moon but to wonder whether joshua can
6945393 the us money supply has experienced the sharpest contraction in modern history heightening the risk of a wall street crunch and a severe economic slowdown in coming months data compiled by lombard street research shows that the m3 broad money
6945394 monthly data for july show that the broad money growth has almost collapsed
6945395 the overall debt burden in the us economy is currently at record levels raising concerns that a recession if it occurs could set off a sharp downward spiral
6945396 the biggest one month fall since modern records began in 1959
6945397 over time inflation will be the last problem that the fed will have to face as a severe us recession and global slowdown will lead to a sharp reduction in inflationary pressures in the u s slack in goods markets with demand falling below supply will reduce pricing power of firms slack in labor markets with unemployment rising will reduce wage pressures and labor costs pressures a fall in commodity prices of the order of 30 will further reduce inflationary pressure the fed will have to cut the fed funds rate much more as severe downside risks to growth and to financial stability will dominate any short term upward inflationary pressures leaving aside the risk of a collapse of the us dollar given this easier monetary policy the fed funds rate may end up being closer to 0 than 1 by the end of this financial crisis and severe recession cycle
6945398 recent government statistics show that only between 10 and 20 of the rebate dollars were spent the rebates added nearly 80 billion to the permanent national debt but less than 20 billion to consumer spending here are the facts tax rebates of 78 billion arrived in the second quarter of the year the governments recent gdp figures show that the level of consumer outlays only rose by an extra 12 billion or 15 of the lost revenue the rest went into savings including the paydown of debt consumer outlays increased to 36 billion from 24 billion so the additional 12 billion of consumer spending was less than 16 of the extra 76 billion of disposable personal income by comparison savings rose by 62 billion or five times as much this experience confirms earlier studies showing that one time tax rebates are not a cost effective way to increase economic activity
6945399 the recent plunge in m3 ed m3 is the broadest measure of money used by economists to estimate the entire supply of money makes it likely that credit lines have been fully tapped and or banks have simply turned off the spigot liquidity shrinks by the day banks scrambling to refinance long term debt are going to have a very tough go of it weekly unemployment claims are soaring consumers out of a job are going to have a tough time paying bills those looking for a bottom in these conditions are simply barking up the wrong tree
6945400 the problem began in the roaring twenties when the fed made money plentiful by keeping interest rates low money seemed to be plentiful but what was actually flowing freely was credit or debt production was up more than wages so more goods were available than money to pay for them but people could borrow money was so easy to get that people were borrowing just to invest taking out short term low interest loans that were readily available from the banks
6945401 the fed began selling securities in the open market reducing the money supply by reducing the reserves available for backing loans the result was a huge liquidity squeeze a lack of available money short term loans suddenly became available only at much higher interest rates making buying stock on margin much less attractive as fewer people bought stock prices fell removing the incentive for new buyers to purchase stocks bought by earlier buyers on margin the stock market crashed overnight

6945435 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign
6945436 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6945437 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6945438 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking

6945440 i have been in the studio here and there working on new songs but dont know when they will come out i was thinking of putting one up on the danzig site so the fans could check it out even thought about doing one on this tour
6945441 winds of plague as individuals have been hit very hard recently by a very selfish act committed by our long time drummer jeff tenney we are disgusted and very disappointed in his actions however we as a band are not going to let this slow us down a few drummers from the tour have stepped up and are helping us finish the remainder of the thrash and burn run we are currently on the search for a new drummer
6945442 we are in iraq now at the invitation of the government

6945446 coming into this poll i was frankly assuming that al franken was in trouble
6945447 hes had such a lousy string of damaging news reports
6945448 you couldnt image a candidate going through a worse time frankly if i was an oncologist and a patient presented this way i would say youre in trouble this could be fatal and indeed it looked really bad for franken and yet when we got the results of this poll it shows that franken and coleman are deadlocked
6945449 the senate race is too much of throwing trash at each other i think
6945450 important issues the economy gas prices the iraq war afghanistan pakistan the decision is going to be based on who has the best answers to those questions i guess
6945451 throughout his career al franken has been a strong voice for the american people using wit and wisdom to call our attention to our countrys most important challenges as gas prices rise and global warming threatens our way of life washington has never been in greater need of his leadership this country needs a leader like al franken to lead the fight for new sources of energy that will protect our planet end our dependence on oil and create millions of jobs

6945454 the story was that to make it big you have to drive around in a stinky van up and down the east coast and play to empty houses the van breaks down youre eating fast food youre up late and driving all day
6945455 its great to have someone say i love your songs

6945460 we dont intend to focus on political or religious aspects for that would make the eight part series dated
6945461 we couldnt leave the hotel for a day but apart from that its been smooth sailing
6945462 the expedition traces stories of espionage and warfare philosophy and medicine entwined with tea along the ancient trading routes from darjeeling india to london
6945463 the bandh has not been called by the gjmm so all shops should open and vehicles should ply normally today
6945464 todays incident is an eye opener and the gjmm should not stay under the false belief that we are cowards or weak we supported the gjmm because they claim their movement is democratic the opposition was suppressed by the gnlf and is being throttled by the gjmm now so where is the democracy they had promised
6945465 the reason gjmm offered for its action is unjustified because the tourist season starts in mid september if their concern was genuinely for tourism they would not have called an indefinite strike during the peak tourist season in june
6945466 ex friends falling out with allen ginsberg lionel and diana trilling lillian hellman hannah arendt and norman mailer
6945467 it seems to me the courts have a very different view on standards and values theres not one man on queen st who could put his hand on his heart and say hed like to see his mother on the back of a harley davidson dressed like that
6945468 i was happy with the intensity and effort we came out of the gates with
6945469 we came down a little bit which can be expected of a young team we need to be able to carry that throughout the game but i am proud of the girls they battled
6945470 after i scored the goal it relaxed my nerves and i was able to settle into the game i thought we moved the ball well as a team throughout the game
6945471 the girls took numerous shots which was a goal for us
6945472 if one of those shots goes in we are standing here with a different result chelsea alone took 10 shots which is impressive if we keep shooting like that a lot more are going to find the back of the net
6945473 i am not happy that we tied but i am happy with the way girls played i think we have a strong basis to build on from here
6945474 we expected to be on the pole but it was a tough session it was difficult to time traffic so i got traffic on both of my new tire runs so it was quite difficult but at least the guy im battling in the championship is right behind me so thats a good thing well see
6945475 i think we have a consistent car for tomorrow so we need to make sure we make the right adjustments for the race tomorrow
6945476 qualifying for us was ok the gearbox let us down in the last two laps i think the shift cable broke maybe i pushed too hard on the cable but were pushing because its qualifying
6945477 im hoping to put up a solid finish tomorrow with the lucas oil lifelock car and gain the maximum amount of points possible
6945478 they tried to make sure i dont feel a difference and to be honest i dont the car is basically the same i keep joking that the seat that i loved burned up but the one i have here is very similar
6945479 its a good start for whats been a tough two days to finish the day in p1 is a great deal but tomorrow is a bigger deal and so is the race so were going to keep working hard
6945480 if i am davids chancellor which i fully expect to be then i will implement that
6945481 there is no disagreement there at all of course everyone is entitled to choose how to live their lives and some marriages do fail but we know that in general marriage is an institution that contributes to building a stronger society
6945482 that is why labour was wrong to stop supporting it through the tax system
6945483 i didnt think the scoring was going to be this low
6945484 it is a good course youve got to do a lot of good things
6945485 the greens are tough and when hunter goes out and shoots that nine under round yesterday it shows you that it is capable and it is out there
6945486 no question especially thursday morning to friday afternoon its a different golf course the greens are definitely bouncy and firmer and definitely played tougher
6945487 strike action is a last resort for our members who provide an invaluable service in ensuring the safety of shipping in british waters
6945488 the latest action could have been avoided if the government and the maritime and coastguard agency mca hadnt continued with their refusal to negotiate a satisfactory outcome
6945489 members have rightly grown angry at the scandalous refusal to pay them the same as other emergency service workers and by the governments policy to cap public sector pay increases below inflation
6945490 first any person who has a good 7 8 hours depending upon individuals of night sleep does not biologically require an afternoon nap but of course
6945491 i do not want to be the leader i refuse to be the leader i want to live darkly and richly in my femaleness i want a man lying over me always over me his will his pleasure his desire his life his work his sexuality the touchstone the command my pivot i don t mind working holding my ground intellectually artistically but as a woman oh god as a woman i want to be dominated i don t mind being told to stand on my own feet not to cling be all that i am capable of doing but i am going to be pursued fucked possessed by the will of a male at his time his bidding
6945492 so do you really believe that in the future were going to have the kind of trouble you write about in your books
6945493 i mean theres no single answer that will solve all of our future problems theres no magic bullet instead there are thousands of answers at least you can be one of them if you choose to be
6945494 we can confirm the deaths of four british nationals in a road traffic accident on august 20
6945495 we are still seeking clarification about the accident from the south african authorities
6945496 traditionally were pretty small up front so im excited to see what these guys can do
6945497 i think 18 is too young of an age to be drinking
6945498 because people are still starting out at college and need to be thinking about their education
6945499 if you lower it then everybodys going to do it
6945500 the presidential statement by design does not take a policy position regarding establishing a drinking age
6945501 what the signers of the amethyst initiative have asked for is an informed and dispassionate public debate over the effects of the 21 year old drinking age
6945502 we know that the 21 minimum drinking age law saves 1 000 lives a year in traffic fatalities
6945503 we are about eliminating drunk driving and we know that lowering the drinking age would make this so much worse
6945504 theres more risk of kids getting drunk at a younger age and a higher number of teens getting in wrecks would be more of a problem
6945505 theres a lot that goes into it because if the age drops you will have a lot less problems with minor consumption but have to deal with kids who arent mature enough
6945506 when youre underage and you drink you have to sneak around and you control yourself better it could go either way it just comes down to the individual and if they can handle being the legal age to drink
6945507 just letting people drink at a young age is no guarantee that you will or will not have problems with alcohol its what the culture teaches about alcohol
6945508 the culture of drinking in the u s is such that if we lower the drinking age its not going to be a positive step we dont have a culture that teaches moderation in drinking
6945509 young people tend to be more impulsive and less likely to make thoughtful decisions about any sort of risky behavior
6945510 given that the brains are still developing what happens when you put alcohol into there theres a lot of concern about that that in fact may inhibit or kind of interfere with that developmental process
6945511 so many people are arrested under 21 for drinking and still a large percent drink anyway so obviously the laws arent changing anything
6945512 if they want to stop drunk driving they should raise the age to drive
6945513 i think its a good idea because itll make people more responsible
6945514 plus they can go fight for their country but they cant have a beer
6945515 i did not use the steroid boldenone or any other steroid of prohibited substance
6945516 i dont agree and never have agreed with the use of this kind of product in order to win for this is cheating
6945517 i will go to the full extent of my power and the law to prove my innocence in this matter
6945518 he cant take stuff like that because he has acromegaly
6945519 all of his hormone levels are a problem regularly so he wouldnt be able to for risk of his life
6945520 we took the best lesnar could give us for 15 minutes and he couldnt finish it
6945521 theres been so much talk about my last blog entry that its amazing some of it is legitimate thinking some of it is just from idiots
6945522 i never said the gsp fight was boring the reason i walked out was because i wanted to beat the crowd
6945523 i didnt think fitch was going to get back in the match and the fight wasnt as exciting as i thought it would be
6945524 if matt hughes look the same as his last couple fights hes going to lose
6945525 but if he came well prepared its going to be very interesting
6945526 the only way to beat him is to push the pace go forward all the time
6945527 if i do that i can catch him ill take care of him
6945528 i never even had a discussion with the ufc about anything ill be honest you bringing that up is the first ive heard of it
6945529 ive been around this sport for years ive never really done any trash talking or anything like that before a match i dont know where that came from
6945530 its just disappointing when you kind of feel like youve done everything right and you get some bad luck early on
6945531 we took the best lesnar could give us for 15 minutes and he couldnt finish it
6945532 the elitexc lightweight champion k j noons face is on the back of this milk carton because hes missing in action i cant seem to find him
6945533 when noons camp wants to track us down and tell us how nick diaz isnt the right fight for them or they want more money or they want this out of their contract or this and that theyre easy to get a hold of
6945534 as far as nick diaz hes not the no 1 contender out there
6945535 look at brandon vera he had a long layoff but hes making more money than the no 1 ranked expletive fighter in the world anderson silva or the same amount
6945536 i dont bend over for nobody and i dont let my fighters do it
6945537 it will be the biggest mismanagement of an athletes career you will ever see
6945538 im sure its going to have to happen eventually whether we fight at 145 or 135 or a catchweight itll happen eventually
6945539 i plan on going so deep into the desert that any failure of my equipment could cost me my life
6945540 if i could get fedor emelianenko first id take it
6945541 it was always my dream to fight at least once in the ufcs octagon but it seems its impossible
6945542 to be honest he was really slippery and i dont mean that like technically wise he was really slippery
6945543 all men are frauds the only difference between them is that some admit it i myself deny it
6945544 quiero la medalla pero estar satisfecho si rindo al m ximo
6945545 quer a hacer algo en este deporte que nadie hubiese hecho antes
6945546 es la despedida so ada es perfecto estoy en una nube
6945547 he only went up 6 points when everyone was saying 15
6945548 pues esto solo te sirve para que no te corramos por haber faltado pero te van a descontar 3 d as
6945549 i think it is an election year when the muslim community really is beginning to understand the importance of making their voices heard as american citizens
6945550 teasers they ran one last thursday for the 52nd time and yet again it turned out to be an ancillary character no one cares about its not dishonest but it feels cheap
6945551 change a random instruction in a program and what happens
6945552 but weve got the engineering models and the design schematics
6945553 weve even got the purchase orders with this upgraded arm i refute you
6945554 its not the kids its not the gaggle of girls its the gaggle of parents the parents are the ones who want the pictures the girls are too shy so its really sweet i love to wave at them and stuff its really funny
6945555 the parents are the most excited the kids are like mom lets go and shes like no were taking a picture its really exciting for everyone in your class really truthfully i love the kids its a pleasure
6945556 hes an amazing guy and anybody would be lucky to be dating him
6945557 he arrived about five minutes before the show started and stood next to the soundboard
6945558 he was wearing a yankees baseball hat and trying no to be noticed he was really into the show you could tell he was really focused on her
6945559 im a single father now and i got to take care of my babies
6945560 thats what god put into my hands thats what i got to deal with i got two babies to raise it is what it is
6945561 she was always willing to help others and thats what ill remember
6945562 now three kids are going to have to grow up without their mother and you know they arent going to get to know their mother like they should know her when they get older
6945563 i cant bring her back if dude dont turn himself in or whatever
6945564 nobody know nothing it will be solved later on in life with god
6945565 death we all will be there one day so this is a celebration we will be there well see her again she here now i wouldnt be talking to you if she wasnt here so its alright im alright i got to be strong for my kids
6945566 we want people to be able to ignore the story if they want but we still want there to be a denser story we want there to be a lot of scripted events that support the story we want the story to be better formed and more interesting plus we want there to be some elements that allow players to feel like theyre in a role playing game
6945567 weve tried to get away from damage as the big scary thing weve tried to get towards restricted movement and having a health system that actually plays into placement where where youre standing makes a difference that really opens things up
6945568 for me there is a big difference between difficulty and challenge challenge is compelling like challenge is basically the illusion of difficulty when you feel a game is really challenging then the game is exciting difficulty is where the game is hard and frustrating so difficulty we try to avoid and challenge we totally want to embrace and one of the problems i think diablo 2 had it would feel difficult and easy but almost never challenging you had almost infinite resources and health so as a designer our only option in this case to actually challenge you is to crush you with damage anything less then just crushing you like one shotting you with damage is not gonna challenge or scare you cause you could instantly recover your health so what we are trying to do is essentially create a game where it is a challenge to just surviving and in which we dont have to make the monsters crush you again
6945569 heaven isnt to far away closer to it everyday now im teary eyed
6945570 convocamos o ronaldinho para a olimp ada pensando tamb m na seq ncia de trabalho na sele o ele representou muito para o grupo fora de campo e correspondeu aqui

6945625 there has been a narrowing down of differences between the various counties it is quite a remarkable feat that 45 different sovereign nations should decide to have one point of view over any issue
6945626 no member of any delegation has told me that they are against giving india a special exemption that the india us nuclear deal requires
6945627 the moment of truth will be when all the 45 counties agree on a consensus

6945648 war is nothing more than the continuation of politics by other means
6945649 the 1998 numbers are especially instructive when examined in this light conservatives actually gained more seats than either the republicans or democrats with fifteen pick ups in the house twelve republican and three democrat plus peter fitzgerald in the senate supposedly moderate republican governors who won big actually had impressive records of state level conservatism in every case from tommy thompsons school vouchers to mike huckabees welfare reform successes and background as president of the arkansas baptist state convention
6945650 america is destined to become a country of distinct relatively independent regions each with its own politico cultural economies metropolitan centers governing elites and global interests
6945651 it is less and less possible for nationally minded elites sitting in washington and new york to construct policies
6945652 the stage could be set for a series of economic and cultural civil wars pitting regions of the country against each other
6945653 to cling to the idea of one nation one culture

6945669 the undercarriage is nude without mudguards the plane can only fly if it doesnt rain we are fine until the end of september but only in the south nothing to put security at risk
6945670 if one is not in line with the norms and dictates alitalia does not take off
6945671 international statistics confirm that alitalia is one of the most secure airlines in the world
6945672 perhaps aviator az does not take into account the delicate situation in which we find ourselves

6945685 is the year 2000 already here are all the millennial parties and promotions and crises all over and done with
6945686 but im curious why is everybody so interested in me
6945687 the year 10000 is just around the corner and it says in your files that you know cobol
6945688 tim you be first what does your mother do all day
6945689 im actually a system programmer specializing in tcp ip communication protocol on unix systems how can i explain a thing like that to a seven year old

6945691 and it was after all of that that the conflict between bill shanahan and the coach from the university of pittsburgh began
6945692 if not completely ended and i am disappointed most of all because i will not be able to teach anymore
6945693 i behaved badly but i wonder if all of you who are listening were to have your worse 8 minutes taped and then put out for general consumption how your life would go
6945694 its certainly a bad moment for debate but its not the way most debates occur we had more than 13 thousand debates last year and this is by far an anomially
6945695 this does show us that what advocacy groups dont like is enforcement of the law
6945696 i think we learned that the most effective means of restoring integrity to the nations immigration system and to make this country safe from vulnerabilities is enforcement of immigration laws
6945697 to call the effort halfhearted would give ice half a heart too much credit
6945698 it was never anything more than a public relations ploy so that ice could say in the end gosh we tried but no one turned up
6945699 usually assistants are young folks out of law school who are excited to learn not a way station for retreads whove been criticized for their less than sterling defense of voting rights laws
6945700 todd knows hans because todd works at the heritage foundation and hans contributes to the heritage foundation he has written some things about voting rights
6945701 we have never seen a political appointee exercise this level of control over the day to day operations of the voting section
6945702 voting rights policies not seen before pushing to curb minor instances of election fraud by imposing sweeping restrictions that would make it harder not easier for democratic leaning poor and minority voters to cast ballots
6945703 we have two reports dealing with voting rights that are yet to be published and my concern is what role he will have in regard to those reports
6945704 does not have any more work to be done on the voting rights briefing
6945705 barack obama is guilty of it whether its him or his campaign people all that talk about how he looks different is typically done to make him a victim i think thats wrong
6945706 i think the intent on obamas part was to use a little humor to try to make a point that being different sometimes is viewed as a liability when its really an asset
6945707 he did open the door but i dont think he was trying to make that an issue thats the last thing that obama needs to do is to come out and remind people that im black if anything he needs to do the very opposite im american and to stick with that
6945708 look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
6945709 i really dont think race is being injected in the campaign at all and im really glad that its not
6945710 i think the people who are injecting it are the ones who have to fill a 24 hour news cycle
6945711 the parties intention is to go ahead and resolve the case
6945712 there was a complete breakdown in what really is one of the most important decision making processes at the department of justice
6945713 this was a decision that seemed to me to be dictated by a certain dogma or political idea as opposed to the facts
6945714 but i could give you some at a discount if you told me you were going to spend the money on a really good cause like donating it to children in myanmar or something

6945729 not having a major fault is not a reason not to worry about earthquakes
6945730 instead of having a single major fault or a few major faults we tend to have a lot of very minor and sort of subtle faults
6945731 its a family of faults and that can contribute to the severity of an earthquake
6945732 its gotten to be really big with fans especially on the internet and they tour producers stopped us from doing it for a couple of nights because they thought it was getting out of hand so we didnt do it and the internet went crazy and the fans cried foul and then they said ok you can do it again and were back

6945751 the relative stability and strength of the brazilian economy in recent years has meant that the mechanics of putting together an international business transaction or partnership with a brazilian company or individual has become a whole lot simpler and more secure and comfortable for investors
6945752 to be closer to asian directors and producers is one of our objectives

6945769 restoration of georgias territorial integrity is unimaginable without true internationalization of the peacekeeping
6945770 our troops were able to prevent the huge russian armies advance for three days before the world woke up
6945771 despite our numerous warnings about the possible russian invasion no one paid an attention to it i myself could not imagine that such a large scale incursion would have occurred

6945775 in exchange for him pleading guilty theyve agreed to lower the three year maximum sentence that usually comes with those charges
6945776 i think they want to prosecute him for free speech issues without actually charging him for them

6945791 towards the end of july after a secure video conference between president bush and prime minister maliki we announced that as part of any agreement with the iraqis establishing our future bilateral releationship would include aspirational time horizons goals for women iraqi troops begin to take over more of the combat mission in various parts of iraq which allow for more us troops to come home so any discussions that are ongoing that we are having with the iraqis right now include these aspirational timelines these goals for more troops to come home
6945792 the shiite domination government in iraq is driving out many leaders of sunni citizen patrols the groups of former insurgents who joined the american payroll and have been a major pillar in the decline in violence around the nation
6945793 these people are like cancer and we must remove them
6945794 like a drug addict who quits only to take drugs again
6945795 were not going to walk away from them and as i said prime minister maliki committed to taking care of them i do think it is somewhat understandable that the government struggles to hire former insurgents for its security forces or for its ministerial positions but this is how you end these kinds of conflicts thats why they call it reconciliation its not done with ones friends its done with former enemies

6945854 it is natural for man to indulge in the illusions of hope we are apt to shut our eyes against a paintful truth and listen to the song of that siren till she transforms us into beasts is this the part of wise men engaged in a great and arduous strugle for liberty are we disposed to be of the number of those who having eyes seen not and having ears hear not the things which so nearly concern their temporal salvation for my part whatever anguish of spirit it may cost i am willing to know the whole truth to know the worst and to provide for it

6945866 before the session began one of saddams lawyers former u s attorney general ramsey clark was ejected from the courtroom after handing the judge a memorandum in which he called the trial a travesty
6945867 clark used to be lyndon johnsons attorney general and in that capacity tried to send dr benjamin spock marcus raskin and others to jail for their advocacy of resistance to the war in vietnam
6945868 visits to hanoi by people like jane fonda and former attorney general ramsey clark and ministers gave us confidence that we should hold on in the face of battlefield reverses
6945869 shall consist only in levying war against them or in adhering to their enemies giving them aid and comfort

6945871 whats going on with this panel im wondering if these guys are ever going to show up
6945872 im glad countdown is over that was a long year of dc nation for me
6945873 when i first started at dc one of the franchises i really wanted to invigorate was teen titans as the legend goes paul levitz my boss didnt believe teen titans were going to work that well because we had done so many reboots before that and they all seemed to trip over it
6945874 when titans came out by geoff johns and mike mckone and was a big hit paul came into my office threw a copy of teen titans onto my desk and goes too bad we cant do the same thing with legion
6945875 we know theres an audience out there and we keep on trying to get it right
6945876 one clear interpretation of the legion by the time were through
6945877 an incredibly strong character when he appears with the teams hes a great counterpoint to a lot of other characters in justice league and other places
6945878 my problem with us is that we reboot the characters too much
6945879 what happens is that if a character doesnt work we go we got a brand new direction to put him in
6945880 our biggest mistake is that we dont continue and build on what we should be doing is let it sit for a while and then come back with a good strong story with whats going on
6945881 is that were locking our characters down were going with a good interpretation and were staying with it thats why you dont see aquaman right now because we want it to be clear what it is who he is and what hes all about
6945882 dont make me bust you here dan in front of this room full of people
6945883 there have been pockets of time where ive tried to allow for it to happen but because of one various mis communication or another it hasnt come together its important that when it does happen it happens correctly and it happens in a way that will appeal to the most people possible so both of you guys are out
6945884 we have not said that wally west will not be the flash
6945885 some of the more recognizable wally west stories deal with the barry allen lore and what his legacy is
6945886 i used to be in taxi cabs with dan and just say we have to bring barry allen back
6945887 now is the time for this character flash is a csi scientist its a whole new avenue for flash stories and these are stories geoff and i want to tell and you have to give us the room now this isnt a reboot we are going to make this part of one long continuous story just like with hal jordan everything that was done even before us was part of a much larger picture were going to do the same thing with barry allen and the entire flash legacy
6945888 i would have believed you if you had just cited your source

6945891 courage is almost a contradiction in terms it means a strong desire to live taking the form of readiness to die he that will lose his life the same shall save it is not a piece of mysticism for saints and heroes it is a piece of everyday advice for sailors or mountaineers it might be printed in an alpine guide or drill book this paradox is the whole principle of courage even of quite earthly or quite brutal courage

6945902 i want somebody whos independent somebody who can push against my preconceived notions and challenge me so we have got a robust debate in the white house
6945903 that i think through big decisions i get a lot of input from a lot of people and that ultimately i try to surround myself with people who are about getting the job done and who are not about ego self aggrandisement getting their names in the press but our focus on whats best for the american people

6945932 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6945933 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign
6945934 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6945935 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally

6945939 we have one confirmed case of listeria thats associated with the provincial outbreak and that case is deceased
6945940 we have confirmed that the primary cause of death is listeriosis
6945941 because he was sick and because he had other conditions it absolutely played a role
6945942 he was sick he had listeria and that was a factor in his death
6945943 what well find out is whether the illness and the meat were linked if its the same strain
6945944 weve put in place a new system that allows us to detect an outbreak and to see a pattern very early in the game
6945945 im glad we got hold of it early and now well take serious steps working with the feds to put it behind us
6945946 we then notified the canadian food inspection agency on aug 6 to tell them we had these positive food samples and the cfia then worked with us to collect further samples from the nursing home

6945987 i am glad the administration has finally shifted to accepting a timetable for the removal of our combat troops from iraq
6945988 there is a provision that says the withdrawal could be done even before 2011 or extended beyond 2011 depending on the security situation

6946004 regrettably ott did not provide us with a good platform on which to build on the success of the past few years
6946005 furthermore he felt that by going to his bosses we had indicted him he actually used the word indicted several times

6946051 era una existencia tan armoniosa y una adaptaci n tan exitosa que no se alter materialmente durante miles de a os
6946052 m s y m s comerciaron cosas que no necesitaban y cuantos m s bienes pose an m s deseaban esto era muy serio puesto que no se dieron cuenta de que estaban alej ndose paso a paso de la buena vida que se les hab a dado

6946057 its just part of the expectations that are on this team
6946058 weve been at a very high end of competition and in the limelight a lot of the years thats a good thing
6946059 the biggest thing we are challenged with with this car is getting it to rotate the middle of the corner
6946060 it just sits on those front bump stops and the front end just doesnt work quite as good dealing with less front down force so you really have to free the car up
6946061 that is why you see the cars dog tracking and all these funky things that we are doing in the rear to try to get the car to rotate the only way to run fast with this car is to be pretty free through the middle of the corners when you do that you arent going to have a real comfortable car in or on the exit
6946062 with the old car we had some more tools where you could have a pretty significant amount of grip in the car in the rear and get the front end to turn
6946063 you can point fingers and try to say this is what has caused us to be behind or that you can say well jeffs made mistakes steve has made mistakes i know where we are and i feel like our team is very capable of being up there in the mix i think its just funny how easily we forget how strong we were last year for whatever reason we just havent been there nobody is working harder than we are internally to make it happen
6946064 your confidence gets down and a lot of things happen
6946065 performances arent always there and its the toughest thing to rebound from that and thats kind of the situation were in right now were working really hard we tested this week in kentucky and we just continue to work hard at it
6946066 sorry i cant make it im in the hospital dieing of a massive heart attack hypothermia depression bear attack fatal burns and a heart murmur and ill fax my drs note to you at the reception

6946069 he showed such character by going for what he wanted in life and not letting anyone stand in his way
6946070 many attempt without success to make up for their lack of talent with defects of character
6946071 moving tanks and troops through the separatist enclave of south ossetia and advancing toward the city of gori in central georgia
6946072 if we launch a war with russia which would seem to be the point of busting out the analogy then how are we going to find the time to launch wars with iran and china

6946077 open market economies which will provide positive incentives for international private investment increased trade and other forms of commercial interactions
6946078 the region of the south caucasus and central asia could produce oil and gas in sufficient quantities to reduce the dependence of the united states on energy from the volatile persian gulf region
6946079 in the caspian black sea region the european union and the united states have concentrated on setting up a reliable logistics chain to connect central asia with the european union via the central caucasus and turkey ukraine
6946080 the new transit route is part of a larger project to build two parallel pipelines connecting china with central asias vast natural gas reserves

6946083 we need to go and let this thing begin and unfold
6946084 wir gehen m ssen und lassen sie diese sache beginnen und entfalten
6946085 abbiamo bisogno di andare e lasciare che questa cosa iniziare e
6946086 if you are asking if i had an orgasm yes it was a job sir
6946087 i didnt have pleasure doing this i was paid to do it

6946090 i could write a happy song if i wanted to
6946091 we found out that wall street has been kind of a nudist beach
6946092 theyre looking for help obviously and the scale of help is such that i dont think it can come from the private sector
6946093 what well see is failures where the bankers were dumb in what they did
6946094 in retrospect i was wrong to partially sell the holdings
6946095 the only way to get somebody who agrees with you 100 percent is to run yourself and i have no interest in that
6946096 oh my god thats your brother dude i have heard so much about you
6946097 update us of any change to your personal information immediately during this process and gave them my new address

6946102 how many degree of freedom for the chi square test with four sample groups and three responses
6946103 and hansel said to gretel let us drop these breadcrumbs so that together we find our way home because losing our way would be the most cruel of things this year i lost my way
6946104 and losing your way on a journey is unfortunate but losing your reason for the journey is a fate more cruel
6946105 the journey lasted eight months sometimes i traveled alone sometimes there were others who took the wheel and took my heart but when the destination was reached it wasnt me who arrived it wasnt me at all
6946106 and once you lose yourself you have two choices find the person you used to be or lose that person completely

6946115 we have asked the gymnastics federation to look into what have been quite a number of questions and apparent discrepancies on this case
6946116 if they had not been cleared they would not have participated in the games
6946117 its only because there is a rivalry between the chinese and american womens gymnastics teams that these questions have arisen
6946118 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
6946119 it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all
6946120 when i touch my shoulder it hurts when i touch my back it hurts when i touch my legs they hurt
6946121 sir there is nothing wrong with your body your finger is broken that is why it hurts wherever you touch get your finger plastered rest it for a couple of weeks and all of your pains will disappear
6946122 my job is over taxing my husband is too demanding my wife nags my children are disobedient my in laws dont understand me etc etc
6946123 i know of this technique that i have heard works really well do you want to try it

6946127 lawmakers and college administrators are trying to shut paroled sex offenders out of student neighborhoods near major u s universities
6946128 youre drunk you cant be driving around like that what the fuck is wrong with you are you fuckin stupid im going to take your keys and you are never going to drive again what is it are you too busy whoring yourself around to be responsible
6946129 you didnt even have the decency to ask me if something was wrong

6946132 works so well is because it doesnt go for the sweeping melodrama that so often dominates film and television
6946133 i launched justhackit com last night im really enjoying managing the site but didnt expect the huge amount of traffic and dont quite know how to manage a community site like this im doing my best with it but thought id post it on sitepoint to see if someone is looking for this type of opportunity
6946134 last week red hat detected an intrusion on certain of its computer systems
6946135 the intruder was able to sign a small number of openssh packages
6946136 his domiciles are constantly fighting for his attention trying to one up each other in a frenzied attempt to be his first choice for the night
6946137 they are not above trashing each others yards or ripping out wiring from garage fuse boxes one even toilet papered a mccain mcmansion in tucson unremarkable except that it was used toilet paper
6946138 i was a pow okay kings x motherfuckers im your goddamn president
6946139 merely adopting an interim ordinance after such a proposal does not mean that the ordinance is arbitrarily enacted to delay or prevent the proposed project
6946140 the court agrees with the city that the interim ordinance was validly enacted
6946141 if a court were to accept the citys argument municipalities would suddenly have carte blanche to stop any project for any reason or for no reason at all even where the project complies with the citys zoning code
6946142 preserving the status quo pending further study of zoning constitutes good faith
6946143 t he practice of arbitrary imprisonments have been in all ages the favorite and most formidable instruments of tyranny
6946144 i think it is very clear this program is on the rise and dave has it headed in the right direction
6946145 i am very happy the administration stuck by him and has shown some patience because more often than not that isnt the case coaches who come in usually have a mess to clean up and by the time they are done straightening it out theyve had a few losing seasons and they are fired
6946146 but if you look at this situation dave has recruited extremely well hes built a great base of talent that talent is starting to mature and more importantly he is bringing in the right kinds of players kids that work hard are good students and dont embarrass the university this thing is being built for the long haul
6946147 i cant support something that we know helps kill juvenile ducks
6946148 this is an issue that we commissioners raised not the public the majority of e mails and phone calls that ive received support keeping the ban in place
6946149 i know theres some dissention about removing the ban but a ualr survey showed the majority of people wanted spinning wing decoys brought back
6946150 we asked all of the surrounding states to come aboard with us on this but to no avail
6946151 no demonstrable impacts on either overall harvest rates or population levels
6946152 it should be a convenience store not a government agency
6946153 estamos comprometidos para mejorar la manera en que respondemos a las preocupaciones y a las cr ticas sobre el fondo
6946154 our investigation will focus on protection of residents from harm medical and nursing care habilitation and treatment services and the placement of residents in the most integrated setting as required by the americans with disabilities act
6946155 we were expecting this because they did an investigation of one or two schools earlier
6946156 we welcome this its a broad investigation were always interested in how we can improve
6946157 is unprecedented and i think it could force a number of reforms in terms of the safety from abuse and neglect and in terms of people who want out who have been unable to get out it will probably show we need far fewer facilities than we have
6946158 sana maging masaya ang anak ko at maganda kung nandun si dennis stroller nga ang gift ni dennis dahil nakalakihan na ni calix ang stroller niya mahal siya pero nakalimutan ko ang brand ako pa naman ang bumili
6946159 regalo na lang sa anak namin huwag siyang imbitahan parang weird lang kung pupunta siya pero hindi siya nababanggit
6946160 narinig ko parang tinanong si cristine tungkol kay calix sana no comment na lang siya ang usapan namin huwag nang magsasalita about the issue hindi rin naman ako nagsasalita its so last year
6946161 nakiusap nga ako kay dennis na pagsabihan si cristine na huwag isali si calix sa usapan bata pa yun para ma drag sa issue kawawa naman naiinis ako pag name mention si calix sa write ups bata pa yun para malaman kung sino siya makikilala rin naman ng anak ko kung sino siya
6946162 hindi no mention about her and we dont talk about her kapag nag uusap kami about the baby lang his work and my work
6946163 may sarili naman siyang career yun na lang ang pag usapan niya at ikuwento sa press huwag na niyang isali ang anak ko

6946165 you cant get a visa to tibet so skip it and come to tibet in tahoe
6946166 healing is important in all of us ive had some of my closest friends pass away in the past year also the state of the world and the situation in tibet and china have many in hardship this mandala is the buddha of healing and can help the individual the community and the world by spreading forgiveness compassion and patience
6946167 the kingdom of shu has many fairy mountains and mount emei stands above them all
6946168 the mountain is a buddha and the buddha is a mountain
6946169 here we have a girl who has been in australia for one term of school and her report card says she has already shown amazing academic promise
6946170 phem srey leak was a beggar from siem reap and her young sister is here in this orphanage suffering from infant alcoholic fetal syndrome when her mother died this young teenage girl had five brothers and sisters to feed so she ended up begging just begging for food
6946171 in a very short time we could see this girl really had it when i asked her what she wanted to do she said i just want to learn everything about everything so after two years here shed gone from no english no opportunities no schooling to passing her international english test
6946172 now her academic qualifications in australia are absolutely stunning shes got all as and bs and has performed better than a lot of australian girls in the class
6946173 remember this is a siem reap beggar girl who is now excelling at a very rich school a college where my parents could never afford to send me
6946174 this is all about giving people an opportunity thats what really spurs me on
6946175 last year the english national ballet people visited siem reap came to a sunday concert saw our kids dancing and thought they had real potential
6946176 our kids are going to teach them khmer dancing and theyre going to teach our kids classical ballet and they will pay for them to go to london where they will be doing a performance with the english national ballet
6946177 i saw that and i thought if a mob of alcoholic homeless street people can give a performance at the concert hall so can our kids i sent the appropriate people in sydney a dvd of our kids performing and asked whether they were good enough
6946178 the organisers said yep the dancing is professional the costumes are sumptuous and the kids are adorable
6946179 so 25 kids from here and 25 kids from phnom penh will perform at the opera house concert hall on october 3 next year
6946180 what a wonderful opportunity for cambodian culture to be shown in australias most prestigious performance arena and what a great opportunity for our orphans
6946181 im proud of being able to help give these kids the opportunity to reach their potential nothing can beat that buzz
6946182 este libro de mikartita sabeuntoko ser una obra inspiradora para los que andan medio desorientados por la vida porque les va a decir qu les depara el destino por un lado y les va a decir c mo son seg n los astros por el otro entonces lean y aprendan
6946183 what we do need to have is more involvement from the hispanic community from a law enforcement standpoint we need more what commonly called community policing
6946184 i feel bad about it they are hispanic like me i dont know how it happened drug dealers was someone robbed a lot of stuff happens around here so you never know
6946185 we are not interested in an immigration status on anyone calling in tips or information we are interested in helping locate the people or persons that did this
6946186 we are confident this was an isolated crime involving people linked to each other not a random act of violence that could have caused further harm

6946195 no i dont think so im going after him first
6946196 are you crazy all you do is talk about this girl why dont you just ask her out yourself
6946197 to ensure that the event adequately reflects the priorities of the government and helps to achieve its domestic and international branding goals
6946198 theres no political involvement at all with regard to how canada will be presented to the world other than our desire to see vanoc the vancouver olympic organizing committee succeed in presenting the 2010 games and canada to the world
6946199 a great ceremonies that will take canada out to the world is going to be the result of collaboration and co operation and input from many many different places
6946200 on behalf of canadian taxpayers we want to make sure that federal dollars are spent in a way thatll promote the 2010 games and promote successful opening ceremonies
6946201 also were hopeful that the 2010 olympic committee will present a fantastic show to canadians and the world and opening ceremonies that will reflect canadas multicultural reality our bicultural history and our official language communities across the country and thats what were hopeful for in terms of getting a return for our investment
6946202 keep in mind this is a memo from one bureaucrat to another
6946203 it had nothing to do with myself or other ministers or the government this is a conversation between two bureaucrats and thats fine
6946204 but our goals internationally and domestically again are to present fantastic opening ceremonies that reflect canadas cultural past our cultural present and promotes canada as the greatest place in the world to live
6946205 we dont see that memo as being political it speaks to the domestic and international priorities of the government
6946206 we have spent a tremendous amount of time with the government of canada understanding brand canada and what they are taking canada out to the world and to canadians as and were aligned with that
6946207 i think the word appropriate is key to what is meant there
6946208 theyre putting in half they would have a lot to say about what goes in
6946209 you bring all of the opinions together you accept some you reject some you modify others you come up with a program for everything
6946210 i find it totally unacceptable to write off big batches of money because robins showed me it doesnt have to be that way
6946211 we explain how the balance got there and the claims process that includes deductibles and co pays
6946212 with government payers if you provide them the right information in the right format theyll pay
6946213 we understand how the system works and review contracts we identify the issue negotiate and ask them to reconsider
6946214 the money we recover is paid directly to the client and we dont bill until the money is in the clients bank
6946215 they take over accounts we were finding difficult to collect on act quickly and many times are successful right then in getting a credit card payment
6946216 they have a magic touch and know state regulations and policies and how to get above the customer service level to someone who has more clout they always go the extra mile
6946217 that would have been lost reimbursements we wouldnt have otherwise gotten
6946218 last month they sent out a letter with a christmas in july special saying you got a discount if you paid the account full in 30 days
6946219 a lot of providers are seeing a decrease in reimbursements from payers and its only going to get worse you have to fight for every single penny
6946220 he was very adamant that it would always be about the wider game and thats what we are seeking to do
6946221 really symbolically show that continuity between the earlier players and the current players
6946222 its very important that country lads know that though they are playing on ant hills theyre playing in remote paddocks they can and they will play on the sydney cricket ground and at lords
6946223 its been recognised at bowral by the foundation and the trust of a need to take the bradman name to a wider audience and through an international hall of fame a cricket hall of fame at bowral an expansion of the museum to make it even more relevant to all age groups
6946224 this is a man who accumulates cricket memorabilia and photographs some of which were apparently lost
6946225 his contribution to the history of cricket has been very important this collector and this house will now be back in the hands of someone who desperately loves cricket
6946226 luckily we have the 1932 film footage and that provides a very good basis for us to restore the appearance and finishes of the verandah
6946227 its going to be very interesting to see whether the bradman name is as relevant in 50 years time in 100 years time
6946228 i sense it will never be forgotten it cant be because of his achievements were matchless
6946229 but of course test match cricket in 50 or 100 years time may not be the most significant form of the game we dont know what the culture of the game going to be
6946230 the centenary is probably the biggest thing that will happen for some time but he will never ever lose his relevance to the game or to people who study the game
6946231 whether the kid is disabled or unruly or just being a hormonal teenager the state is saying hey we have a really easy option for you
6946232 if we save one child from being abused its well well worth it
6946233 the main interest i have is that it gives the mother or a parent another option of what to do with a child before they do something drastic
6946234 a labile physical system is one that is in a state of flux
6946235 right now he needs to be extremely astute with everything he does with a labile system any intervention any small movement could have a huge impact an impact that could be felt for years
6946236 mccourt sounds so damn equivocal whenever he is asked about about collettis future that needs to stop
6946237 right now when the team is fighting for the playoffs mccourt should show total confidence in colletti
6946238 there is a time for legitimate doubt a time when he may decide to move in another direction but the time to show doubt is not now not midseason what he communicates to everyone in his entire organization is a sense of not being able to make up his mind
6946239 that might seem like a really small thing but its as telling as the game itself
6946240 good leadership permeates it cascades down not just to the players but to the secretaries and the hot dog vendors and yes even the elevator operators

6946242 command to see which changeset or patch modified a particular line of a source file and so on
6946243 can accept several other diff formats but mq doesnt a unified diff contains two kinds of header the
6946244 each operate on a single patch at a time by default you can push and pop many patches in one go
6946245 will incorporate any outstanding changes into the new patch it creates but
6946246 will revert modifications to any files affected by the patch that it is popping
6946247 to pick up any files added or removed by the patch followed by hg qrefresh
6946248 ever mentions an offset or fuzz factor you should make sure that the modified files are correct afterwards
6946249 them all in 30 seconds on a newer laptop the time to push all patches dropped to two minutes i could hg qrefresh
6946250 commands allow you to push and pop multiple patches at a time
6946251 to be sure of where you stand i have several times worked on and hg
6946252 ed a patch other than the one i intended and its often tricky to migrate changes into the right patch after making them in the wrong one

6946257 hopefully this thorough report puts to rest the various 9 11 conspiracy theories which dishonor the men and women who lost their lives on that terrible day
6946258 the public should really recognize the science is really behind what we have said
6946259 there is a need for striking proper balance between development and environment
6946260 the good news is that they want to re engage
6946261 it became a huge issue because of the politics on both sides i wouldnt say if we solve the ssm the rest will fall in place but what im pretty certain is if we dont solve this the rest will not fall into place
6946262 its also the view by others that the more time passes the more the ability of an administration to contract
6946263 i know there are a lots of conspiracy theories running on this to be frank i dont suspect the u s broke on the ssm not to have cotton on the table they know cotton has to be there
6946264 futures prices have been declining over the last two days on reports of good rains and increased stocks in erode market but overall the market sentiment is bullish till diwali as demand for export mainly middle east may start by next week
6946265 a medium term bearish trend may come into existence if market fails to breach important resistance around rs 4 500 levels which may bring the prices as low as rs 3 600 and then rs 3 220

6946280 in columbia county all of the black athletes were going to boycott playing because they had fired all of the black administrators in columbia county so it got to a point where i was like ok i can go to santa fe
6946281 santa fe they had a real good program with guys like shea and all these running backs but they were lacking a quarterback
6946282 i lived in fort white which was 15 minutes from lake city and 15 minutes from santa fe so it made sense
6946283 for a while it felt like i had a chance to play college football but didnt even have a high school team
6946284 our other roommate was dwayne mobley the fullback and some of his old friends from high school would come up and they would team up
6946285 and demetric and i we would be on teams and we would argue all week about we cheated or you cheated or whatever something like that just the camaraderie just hanging out together was a lot of fun
6946286 before we knew it the sun was up and we had been awake all night
6946287 we found out we had all sorts of stuff in common
6946288 i remember eating a sub and soon after it came back all over my bed
6946289 everybody else on the team was fine but we were as sick as two dogs
6946290 it was just like playing with him we always competed
6946291 he would draw up plays and i would try to find ways to stop them
6946292 i think it all helped the team get better he brought great work ethic and so did i i think it translated well to the kids
6946293 here we went after each other every single day and now were either going to kill each other or cry no matter who loses or wins
6946294 hes such a good friend and im really excited for him there is so much similar that we do we didnt invent the game its still football and we still have the common goal of making the playoffs

6946305 i thought that barack obama was not going to attack senator mccains wife

6946321 we have to prove success is not a one off we must see 2012 as a huge chance to bring the fervour of beijing which has captivated people in our country into the british olympics
6946322 the country will want to see our athletes honoured the country will want to celebrate their success and give them permanent recognition

6946329 hey now i know i might not be much now but i use to be thin and somewhat attractive and i use to play those games

6946335 the school feels blessed having a new group of students move in
6946336 our biggest adjustment was learning how to be physical even with a spread offense
6946337 in a spread offense its not up in your face like the wing t was the spread still can be very physical
6946338 last year it was a little tougher just getting used it
6946339 weve run the wing t for so long everyone was so used to it the change to the spread was a big difference
6946340 this year we already know it its a lot easier
6946341 deforestation forest degradation biodiversity loss and co2 emissions in riau sumatera indonesia
6946342 the problem we have is that as we understand it and based upon the evidence that ive seen is that they circulated these petitions with etzels name never intending her to be the candidate
6946343 they went to the convention nominated barr and then she withdrew
6946344 there was no way to know that barr was even in contention
6946345 much less the national party nominee at the time we started gathering signatures

6946351 i agree with the bible that homosexuality is wrong and i want to change my sinful desires are so strong that i often have problems believing the bible when i struggle so hard with my own heart
6946352 i find most churches are more interested in programs and numbers than helping real people like me with a real problem they are more quick to participate in some sort of legislative action against homosexuality rather than spend some time with me my friends in the gay community are always there for me
6946353 the church is the hope of the world and the church needs to get serious about reaching out to these people who struggle with homosexuality
6946354 the church doesnt need some special sort of learning or training in order to deal with the sin of homosexuality like any sin we all need and must have the help of christ to save us from our sins
6946355 we all deal with for as long as we are alive
6946356 it would be my hope that soon exodus would no longer be needed and the church could function well in ministry to homosexuals
6946357 churches are central to the healing of anyone not just the homosexual
6946358 we at exodus are committed to the restoration of lives built on the solid foundation of the bible and lived out in the church
6946359 a new family a whole new life and a chance to live again the way i am supposed to live
6946360 each week i go to listen to the preaching and learn about the bible
6946361 i pray there and seek to really encounter jesus through the worship of all of his people who are there with me i use every bible class and every chance i can get to be with the lords people as help when i know i will really need it the people at my church helped me turn my life around

6946395 there was tremendous pent up demand for vista sp1 either due to customer dissatisfaction with the product or because users were convinced of its benefits from all of the media hype surrounding its release no similar demand existed for windows xp service pack 3 most likely because overall the majority of users are quite happy with windows xp service pack 2 we found just a handful of users still running service pack 1
6946396 what seems clear from these numbers is that microsofts customers felt windows vista was in urgent need of a service pack 12 18 months after it was released while those still using windows xp were relatively happy with the platform and in no rush to patch it
6946397 im not going to talk about about the specification of the product

6946446 a witness motivation for testifying as well as any other potential incentives for falsification are always relevant lines of inquiry
6946447 courts generally are liberal in admitting evidence of bias because a jury must be sufficiently informed of the underlying relationships circumstances and influences operating on the witness to determine whether a modification of the testimony reasonably could be expected as a probable human reaction
6946448 a successful showing of bias on the part of a witness would have a tendency to make the facts to which he testifies less probable in the eyes of the jury than it would be without such testimony t he exposure of a witness motivation in testifying is a proper and important function of the constitutionally protected right of cross examination

6946530 are we going to repeat the entire process that took us here in order to win back democracy

6946532 in the last elections the people spoke clearly they refused things as they are and decided to do something about it

6946568 apure internet customer is generally not as responsive to catalogs as a multichannel or retail customer
6946569 as cata logers get smarter about how to mail to all customers that percent age should increase
6946570 that so many are using social marketing is really interesting for catalogers
6946571 if catalogers web site sales are down theyre not investing in prospecting enough
6946572 youve got to be in the viral game and you have to be where youre constituents are
6946573 ive always felt that at some point we would reach a critical mass where some people would prefer to pick up the phone and some to shop online

6946583 we also get a lot of pharmaceuti cal advertisers who are measuring response against a toll free number or reply e mail so theyre able to quantify the engagement with the reader
6946584 weve done a number of readership studies that show that not only does relish get read but there is also a large pass along readership because of the recipes
6946585 a story on a recipe that uses a cuisinart is a good spot to make an offer to buy a cuisinart direct either through us or through retailer chefs catalog
6946586 these end up being stories that drive impulse buys with the relish brand providing legitimacy as well as the unique offer specific to that readership
6946587 the majority of our list is female so some of the slant of the direct marketing creative will be geared toward women

6946621 mahyuddin kamu harus meyakinkan orang lapangan agar mereka setuju dengan perdamaian
6946622 beliau pernah bilang kepada saya dan farid saat kami bertemu tahun 2003 bahwa suatu hari nanti aceh pasti damai asalkan tidak ada pihak yang berkhianat
6946623 teungku idi ialah orang yang diberi kelebihan oleh allah untuk melihat masa depan atas permintaan farid beliau pernah meramal bahwa susilo bambang yudhoyono dan jusuf kalla akan jadi presiden dan wakil presiden indonesia jauh sebelum pemilu 2004 digelar
6946624 namun ternyata allah berkehendak lain pada hari jumat sebulan sebelum mou helsinki ditandatangani teungku idi dipanggil oleh yang maha kuasa
6946625 dia itu bukan gam tetapi dia lebih gam daripada gam
6946626 makanya saya kerahkan pasukan di sepanjang perjalanan yang mereka lewati saya juga perintahkan pada pasukan gam bila ada kejadian tak diinginkan keselamatan pak farid dan pak mahyuddin harus diutamakan
6946627 saya pesan kepadanya dan pasukan yang mengamankan perjalanan bahwa keselamatan kedua orang itu adalah prioritas utama
6946628 saya tidak sadari ternyata pak farid orangnya besar dan gemuk jadi ketika saya melihat pak farid berjalan dan berusaha menggapai sesuatu di jalan mendaki saya langsung memberikan tangan untuk menolongnya saya juga segera kontak teman yang berbadan lebih besar sebab kalau ada apa apa saya tidak bisa membawa lari pak farid yang berbadan besar tidak kuat
6946629 saya tanya pada sofyan apa gam lapangan mau menerima perdamaian
6946630 sofyan dan pak jusuf kalla ngobrol di telepon lalu sofyan menghubungi muzakkir manaf dan menyerahkan telepon pada farid

6946636 there really hasnt been anything that wasnt suppose to be on the list
6946637 its beneficial because people in our community that cant afford some of the stuff can get things they need
6946638 also you can get rid of larger things such as refrigerators and mattresses
6946639 its the locals in the communities that make it work

6946641 it snowballed from the get go i was afraid a month in with 600 members that it was too large to manage

6946676 dos veces tuve problemas una vez mi auto estaba estacionado y una camioneta que ten a un gancho hizo marcha atr s y me destroz una de las pticas otra vez un fiat 147 con defensa la choc a mi mujer y casi la mata
6946677 los paragolpes o las partes de carrocer a que cumplan esa funci n no podr n ser alterados respecto del dise o original de f brica o de aquel establecido por el constructor en etapa posterior no ser admitido el agregado de ning n tipo de aditamento del que pueda derivarse un riesgo hacia los peatones u otros veh culos
6946678 la defensas que trae un auto de f brica vienen dise adas para absorber el impacto y causar el menor da o posible dentro de la cabina en la que van los pasajeros cuando se coloca un sistema de defensa adicional se anulan estas propiedades
6946679 antes de venir al taller los due os de los autos les sacan esos elementos porque si no no se los aprueba pero el problema es que en la calle siguen circulando hay que hacer controles m s intensivos
6946680 es muy poco en cualquier punto de la ciudad se pueden encontrar much simos veh culos con defensas la soluci n es clara hay que hacer m s controles no puede ser que est n prohibidas desde 1987 cuando se sancion el c digo de tr nsito y que todav a haya gente que se las ponga a sus autos adem s el municipio est adherido a la ley nacional que tambi n las proh be
6946681 es una violaci n a la ley de tr nsito por eso estamos incrementando los operativos los elementos ilegales que m s se detectan son las defensas y los ganchos para remolques que est n permitidos s lo en el momento preciso en el que se est remolcando otro veh culo pero despu s no pueden llevarlos
6946682 habitualmente el seguro contra terceros cubre los da os que causa un veh culo a otro pero en la p liza se asegura el rodado tal como sali de f brica adem s de que est n prohibidos los elementos adicionales como las defensas no est n contemplados en la p liza
6946683 el veh culo est dise ado para que la fuerza del choque se distribuya en una zona amplia pero con las defensas se concentra s lo en pocos puntos y los da os son a n mayores por ejemplo en el caso de un choque lateral pueden atravesar la carrocer a ingresar dentro del habit culo y causar heridas muy graves a los pasajeros

6946699 he sido objeto de una innecesaria presi n y menosprecio de parte de terraf quien perdi la objetividad que debe reglar su tarea y confundi los roles procesales de imputado y testigo presi n recibo al leer en la prensa que se me imputa falsamente de delitos cometidos en el ejercicio de mi funci n sin fundamento alguno tildando a las actuaci n llevadas a cabo de fraguadas armadas o falsas niego que haya sometido a nadie a alg n tipo de coacci n o apremio
6946700 la inmoral y perversa disyuntiva a que me somete es que si reconozco las actas testimoniales con mi firma se me pretende imputar un presunto delito de falsificaci n y si las hubiera negado el delito de falso testimonio

6946747 en 7 a os del colegio al empleo capacit a 100 mil chicos
6946748 durante 2008 se va a capacitar a 10 mil j venes con el programa del colegio al empleo y en los 7 a os que llevamos ya se formaron 100 mil chicos el primer a o comenzamos con 250 alumnos tuvimos un crecimiento muy grande
6946749 a uno no le ense an c mo se ingresa al mundo laboral
6946750 el programa trabaja sobre 4 ejes fundamentales el primero apunta al conocimiento personal qui n soy y as saber cu les son mis caracter sticas potencialmente empleables qu conocimientos poseo formales o informales por ejemplo los chicos a los 17 saben manejar la computadora pero no tienen un t tulo o han estudiado tambi n hay que valorizar lo que aprendieron durante estos a os en la escuela y armar perfiles
6946751 hay que entender que las caracter sticas de mi personalidad influyen en los trabajos que puedo conseguir por ejemplo si siempre fui una persona de hablar mucho he trabajado en centros de atenci n telef nica lo m o en ese caso es hablar ese an lisis uno por lo general no lo hace y menos a los 17
6946752 si arm mi perfil de recepcionista y voy a estudiar ingenier a qu mica
6946753 a veces los chicos ni siquiera saben que tienen derecho a pensar d nde quieren trabajar y se limitan antes de salir a buscar trabajo que el mercado sea d ficil no significa que no tengan el derecho de pensar hacia d nde quieren ir puede que parezca que en muchos casos no tienen ganas de nada pero en realidad s tienen ganas lo que sucede en que no saben por d nde c mo volverse adultos
6946754 las posibilidades de conseguir trabajo se ampl an en cambio se limitan si se presentan por un aviso al que concurren 400 aspirantes
6946755 el tercer punto es c mo busco trabajo c mo hago una carta de presentaci n un curriculum c mo manejo una entrevista c mo desarrollo mis estrategias de b squeda
6946756 el cuarto eje tiene que ver con los derechos laborales en la argentina la tasa de empleabilidad de j venes aument acompa ando el crecimiento de la econom a pero subsiste una tasa muy grande de trabajo informal y ellos no saben que tienen derecho a vacaciones a una obra social nosotros queremos dotarlos de esa informaci n para que puedan disponer de un trabajo de mejor calidad no podemos modificar el mercado de trabajo porque a veces uno elige trabajar en una condici n porque no tiene alternativa pero deben conocer sus derechos
6946757 este a o ongs recaudaron m s de u s250 mil con subastas on line
6946758 en el primer semestre del a o las fundaciones recaudaron a trav s de mercado solidario u s250 mil y vendieron casi 2 500 productos en 2007 se comercializaron m s de u s123 mil creemos que cada vez con mayor frecuencia se va a utilizar esta metodolog a para recolectar fondos
6946759 en esta subasta tem tica mercado solidario olimp adas messi lider el r nking de visitas lo siguieron muy de cerca los productos de las leonas y de gin bili
6946760 la remera de messi fue el art culo por el que m s se pag
6946761 en general los deportistas colaboran mucho con las ongs algunos de ellos como varios artistas son padrinos de las organizaciones y all se establece el v nculo y tratan de colaborar con productos con acciones
6946762 mercado solidario naci al principio del proyecto de mercado libre all por 1999 los fundadores de la compa a cre an que para que al negocio le fuera bien les ten a que ir bien a los pa ses donde estaba presente entonces ponemos a disposici n la plataforma que tenemos de comercio electr nico para que las fundaciones y organizaciones sin fines de lucro puedan recaudar fondos por supuesto no les cobramos por los servicios que utilizan y los ayudamos en el armado y la difusi n de las subastas
6946763 durante agosto estamos cumpliendo 9 a os con mercado libre
6946764 tenemos m s de 28 millones de usuarios registrados en la regi n y hay 40 mil personas seg n un estudio de nielsen que generan todo o gran parte de sus ingresos con ventas a trav s del sitio eso quiere decir que su nico trabajo consiste en vender v a mercado libre
6946765 el a o pasado se vendieron 17 5 millones de art culos y m s de 2 millones de vendedores y m s de 5 millones de compradores
6946766 even with all the destruction carried out by the rice growers the supreme court decided in their favor
6946767 the farmers want the indigenous land to be divided into islands they dont want the indigenous land to be a continuous tract of land but legal experts in brazil maintain that there is no legal basis to annul the 2005 demarcation
6946768 in relation to the accusations of money coming in from venezuela and farc rebels i have no evidence for or against it
6946769 but its fair to say that whenever theres some criticism or attack to be made against social movements in brazil the farc are always dragged out although very little evidence is ever provided to prove these allegations so it seems once again that its an attempt to criminalize social movements in brazil and discredit their work in favor of the poor and the marginalized
6946770 indigenous people across the amazon have persistently complained to amnesty and denounced violations committed by soldiers who work indigenous areas sexual abuse physical abuse and intimidation
6946771 there seems to be a clear contradiction in the sense that indigenous areas are meant to limit the access into those areas to guarantee their safety and protection yet when the army goes in there time and time again we see that their rights are violated
6946772 we want to be clear on something fundamental indian lands are brazilian lands
6946773 there are no nations or indian peoples there are brazilians who are indians
6946774 this is something we see not only in the amazon but across brazil
6946775 the cultural social and economic rights of indigneous peoples tend to come into conflict with the economic interests of big agro industry and big agro industry has been the driving force of the recent economic boom thats occuring in brazil and weve seen that theres a lot of political and judicial support for their interests
6946776 when the federal authorities comply with their obligations under the constitution and under international legislation to identify and guarantee indigenous access to their ancestral lands
6946777 the challenges which come up tend to be around the economic interests of big agro industry in this case the rice farmers and time and again the indigenous peoples are losing out because vested interests tend to side with those with economic power
6946778 in this case its not that the military has allied itself with the farmers
6946779 rather two separate interests have come together this handful of farmers theyre extremely wealthy its not about them its about how brazil will use the amazon are they going to just leave it to the indians who wont develop it or does brazil have a plan for developing the amazon this is a discourse of economic development
6946780 they are saying what we do is good for the state and national economy they call themselves the nationalist resistance they consider themselves those who represent the nation against the indians who are supported by foreign interests they never say who these interests are but by conflating the local conflict into this language of nationalism and development of developing the nation they were able to get closer to the militarys cause
6946781 a decision against raposa would create the legal precedents to revoke all indigenous titles to land in brazil
6946782 any other territory could be contested like the yanomami kayap etcetera
6946783 what is on the line here is article 231 of the brazilian constitution and the indigenous rights that are layed out in that article
6946784 its not that the court decision will directly affect the constitution but the arguments that are being used go against article 231 it seems that the justice system is going to favor the big landowners and this will open up the way to revise article 231
6946785 the 1988 constitution allows indigenous people the process to set out and identify their ancestral lands
6946786 theres a real fear that this will set back cases across the country of indigenous peoples who continue to fight for the rights to their land and who through this process continue to seek the provision of their basic human rights and cultural rights
6946787 defined the rights of indigenous peoples over their lands and established that these rights enjoy over riding precedence over any subsequent rights granted to non indigenous holders
6946788 the demarcation process doesnt give indigenous people the full rights to their land but allows the land to be held by the federal government in custody for them
6946789 indigenous peoples are considered minors under brazilian law and thus do not have the right to hold the land for themselves and decide on the land for themselves
6946790 it is an issue which has been hotly contested and which many believe limit the rights of indigenous peoples to their full citizenship and full rights under international law
6946791 it would seriously undermine the whole system of indian reserves in brazil if the courts were to bow to pressure from influential landowners and politicians particularly given the violence the indians have been subjected to
6946792 mark the future of development in brazil in relation to the amazon
6946793 will we continue a predatory model of exploitation that doesnt respect the law
6946794 or will brazil be transformed definitively into a country that develops itself sustainably and respects human rights
6946795 in any conversation the tone you adopt can matter as much as the substance of your discussion
6946796 the tone of exchanges with our friends in the pacific certainly needed changing when we came to office we committed ourselves from the outset to change progress and reform are far more likely to be achieved through a respecting and respectful relationship
6946797 commitment to assist the pacific island countries to address their unique and some cases significant development needs
6946798 embracing commitments from pacific partners to improve governance and increase investment in economic infrastructure
6946799 special measures in relation to fiji consistent with paragraph 2 iv of the biketawa declaration
6946800 the longer fiji drifts the more open it will be to influence from china which is working to expand its presence in the south pacific
6946801 all the more reason to prod the island nation to make its way back to the league of liberal democracies

6946882 mccains sacrifice had nothing to do with protecting the united states he was sent to vietnam along with hundreds of thousands of others in an attempt to prop up what was essentially an american colony south vietnam which was being run by a dictator whom we installed
6946883 that had we taken the war to the north and made full consistent use of air power in the north we ultimately would have prevailed
6946884 is it morally right to drop bombs and missiles in a heavily populated area where hundreds if not thousands of civilians will perish

6947072 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6947073 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos

6947075 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica

6947084 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6947085 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6947086 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6947087 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

6947108 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6947109 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6947110 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
6947111 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6947112 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6947113 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6947114 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
6947115 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
6947116 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
6947117 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6947118 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6947119 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
6947120 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6947121 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6947122 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
6947123 if i wake up and see my maker coming with all of his crimson and his iron desire well drag the streets with the baggage of longing to be loved or destroyed from a void to a grain of sand in your hand
6947124 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6947125 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6947126 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6947127 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6947128 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6947129 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6947130 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6947131 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6947132 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6947133 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6947134 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6947135 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6947136 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6947137 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
6947138 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6947139 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6947140 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6947141 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6947142 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6947143 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6947144 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6947145 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6947146 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6947147 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6947148 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6947149 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6947150 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6947151 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6947152 those who delivered us into this mess can not be trusted to get us out of it
6947153 if you have a green party i want to join
6947154 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6947155 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6947156 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6947157 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6947158 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6947159 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6947160 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6947161 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6947162 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6947163 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6947164 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s

6947167 hanya orang orang yang berkepentingan saja yang bisa hadir di sini
6947168 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6947169 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6947170 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6947171 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6947172 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6947173 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6947174 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6947175 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6947176 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6947177 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6947178 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6947179 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6947180 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6947181 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6947182 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6947183 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6947184 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6947185 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6947186 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6947187 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6947188 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6947189 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6947190 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6947191 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6947192 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6947193 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6947194 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6947195 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6947196 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6947197 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6947198 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6947199 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6947200 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6947201 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6947202 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6947203 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6947204 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6947205 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6947206 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6947207 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6947208 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6947209 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6947210 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6947211 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6947212 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6947213 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6947214 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6947215 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6947216 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6947217 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6947218 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6947219 the america that we know that the founding fathers envisioned will cease to exist
6947220 sometimes the problems have to get larger before you can solve them we can still drive around the potholes so they must not be big enough
6947221 those people that believe in shooting animals through the fences ought to turn the rifle the other way
6947222 garvee is like swallowing a raw egg it seems to be one of those things thats really hard to stop in the middle of
6947223 im a professional dairyman i have milked and milked everything i can possibly milk
6947224 idaho is ranked last in the nation in protecting the safety of children in day care centers
6947225 this anti discrimination bill is something we will propose every year until it passes
6947226 i assumed it would be a bunch of radical college students so to fit the part i grew a goatee got a revolutionary t shirt and put on some ratty jeans
6947227 divorce is just terrible its one of satans best tools to kill america
6947228 most of the hospitals in this country have christian names if you think hindu prayer is great where are the hindu hospitals in this country go down the list where are the atheist hospitals in this country theyre not equal
6947229 we are all nintendo warriors today remember that game that electronic game a few years ago push buttons zim zam boom and it was all over with that is not the way you fight war although we as a society have grown to believe that
6947230 while we are democrats and republicans in our hearts we are all idahoans
6947231 one of the hardest things weve had to do here is taking off our party hats
6947232 this is outrageous the people of idaho are entitled to have their representatives base their votes on the merits of a bill not on who backed the loser in a speakers contest
6947233 there was one of those six projects that was removed altogether why because the senator and the representatives from that district were from the wrong political party we need to take a step back
6947234 im prepared to bid for that first ticket to shoot a wolf myself
6947235 to get a kick out of smoking industrial hemp it would take a cigar the size of a telephone pole
6947236 i guess i would just make a plea saying we need the money you know we need the money on roads
6947237 i dont think we should let the threat of a lawsuit force us to implement something thats not well thought out
6947238 theres a lot of things that i pointed out in my state of the state address that havent passed unfortunately i cant think of one that has
6947239 the clear factual findings regarding the incident show that the tank crew identified mr shana and mr mizyed the reuters sound man injured in the attack along with the black tripod mounted object they carried and directed at the tank as a potential threat to the tank and its crew
6947240 this suspicion was strongly supported by the hostilities of the previous hours which included an anti tank attack the conduct of mr shana and mr mizyed who were both wearing body armor common to palestinian terrorists
6947241 the upshot of this whole tragedy is that raising a camera in gaza as a journalist could get you killed
6947242 thats just the gist of it we havent led enough laps we havent knocked off as many top fives we havent done those things as well as we need to do to win more races when you dont do those things youre not going to win a lot of races
6947243 we came into the year last year after our testing feeling like we were a touch behind from the gibbs cars
6947244 thought we had made some ground up on a lot of teams thought the gibbs cars had done a better job thought maybe the roush group had done a little better job
6947245 weve been kind of playing catch up on that the whole time i dont think weve fallen further behind some days i think were caught up and other days i think we havent we just havent performed at that level where you can go out and win four or five races a year
6947246 im a lot more comfortable and a lot more confident but anything can happen at bristol
6947247 i received mine in a blood transfusion back during the vietnam area i went from 200 pounds to 140 and i had forgotten how to get up how to walk and then a friend of mine brought me a border collie
6947248 youve got something that bonds with you theyre not gonna just let you sit there and waste away
6947249 and i really look for all the rest of em to be clear and these border collies had a lot to do with it
6947250 they were specifically targeted because thats where the money was
6947251 in my view the mirzakhalilis came dangerously close to a count that did include endangering life
6947252 but this jury seems to be stuck behind closed doors and giving no indication of what theyll do
6947253 and this isnt a jury of six or 12 this is a jury of one
6947254 i share the interest and anxiety of many hoosiers who would love to see evan bayh on the ticket
6947255 i think it could make it a blue state in november
6947256 in indiana hes a favorite son hes an administrator he has been the ceo of the state of indiana he governed without tax increases jobs grew and he showed hoosiers he could govern and i think hes very very much a midwesterner
6947257 the middle of the midwest and the north of the old south
6947258 we need a place where people can have a discussion and get information
6947259 and people need to know that its not coming from an anti mormon place or a gay castro district place its coming from a faithful place
6947260 when i heard and saw the letter that the church leaders had read in sacrament meetings i was appalled
6947261 so i said thats it i want mormons to know that there are gay people in their congregations every sunday
6947262 i really just want people to try and understand and see the pain they are causing gay members of the church who are struggling
6947263 provide license to infringe or impose upon the rights and liberties of others
6947264 if there would have been a site like this it would have been really helpful
6947265 last time during prop 22 all i did was vote no this time i wanted to stand up and be heard even though its hard
6947266 there is a lot of anxiety and stress over being conflicted being an active mormon and being for gay marriage
6947267 thats part of the reason we wanted to do the site
6947268 if you think you are the only person in your ward that feels that way and the rhetoric is really loud its painful
6947269 the church of course recognizes and accepts that some among its very large membership may view the issue differently
6947270 only innocent people die when the pakistan army carries out airstrikes in bajaur or swat
6947271 i want somebody who is going to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policy making
6947272 franken made a number of mistakes that could have been fatal to many campaigns but the broader political environment is very challenging to coleman
6947273 i feel pretty good about that poll i feel pretty good about the race
6947274 it confirms what weve been seeing all summer that minnesotans are ready for a change and that the more they see of norm coleman the less they want to send him back to washington
6947275 if that continues its going to be hard for franken to win
6947276 i could care less if im hurting one candidate or another
6947277 we came outside and we saw flames coming out of the house we went to look and it started exploding even more
6947278 the other night i was with a group of people and the fastest thing to do was to get on the bus some of these people had never been on a bus as if this was some awful low class way
6947279 people who wouldnt normally take the bus they can see this beautiful piece of art here and want to take public transportation
6947280 we as an industry need to repaint the picture and make it attractive
6947281 if you are reading this then you are already dead
6947282 a death threat by no means is a legitimate form of political expression
6947283 a set of causes probably came together to cause the accident
6947284 if the iraqi government at that time decides it is necessary to keep the american forces longer they can do so
6947285 what my presence can do is to identify any final obstacles
6947286 its like saint patricks day everybody gets to be irish for a day were just enjoying building good positive bridges and relationships here in the city and around the state of kansas
6947287 its all black people together united just having a good time
6947288 now i see where they coming from they helping us all the time we aint always got to be scared of them
6947289 gubernur juga mampu menjembatani hubungan antara bupati walikota dengan pemerintah pusat jumlah kabupaten dan kota yang kini mencapai 423 kabupaten dan kota diakui menimbulkan rentang kendali yang panjang
6947290 hello my name is i speak spanish and i like
6947291 hello my name is i speak spanish and i like
6947292 still not pregnant it takes a long time for you guys
6947293 but it was already his birthday yesterday we had cupcakes for snack
6947294 he has a friend hes not shunned yay my boy is not an outcast
6947295 gosh it seems like ive been reading this forever when will it ever end
6947296 oh this is by no means what a hollywood party is like
6947297 those dont look like woolly mammoths theyre like cartoon fiberglass elephants fooking ell
6947298 none of them know what those strange oblong things called books are
6947299 they probably call it the wall with good childrens names
6947300 is this what its like when you go out in hollywood
6947301 this is how the other half live im an east side hipster we stick to indie rock red wine and artistic integrity
6947302 i dunno maybe theyre hefs playmates or maybe theyre on some reality show
6947303 what show would that be surgical mistakes stephen quipped no doubt coming soon on spike tv
6947304 sandwiches with names of weapons and dishes inspired by terrorist acts all prepared by a chef dressed as a soldier
6947305 lodged a formal complaint against the abuses suffered by the team the government admitted that lebanon against hezbollah can do little or nothing
6947306 and did you exchange a walk on part in a war for a lead role in a cage
6947307 can you imagine if russia decided to close down cnn
6947308 the pullback of russian troops and units passed without incident and was completed on time
6947309 russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
6947310 but ive respected the process from day one and i want to continue to do that today and allow any details about the process and final decisions to be made by senator obama and their campaign not by anybody else
6947311 i am not in that arena this is his decision and i respect him to make it however he thinks is best for him and the country
6947312 john mccains been living like this for the last 25 and obviously doesnt have a very clear sense of what ordinary americans are going through
6947313 maybe mccain thinks this economy is working for folks like him
6947314 obviously they are going to talk about the six party talks obviously recent discussions about the verification package which we have been calling on the north koreans to produce
6947315 going to assess where things are with north korea in his conversations with north korean officials
6947316 the us government wants to see this verification package as soon as possible so that we can move forward with this delisting
6947317 the united states has not kept its promise to remove us from the list of states sponsoring terrorism up until today past the deadline which is crucial to the complete implementation of the agreement
6947318 this is a clear violation of the action for action principle which is the basis for the realization of denuclearization
6947319 the pullback of russian troops and units passed without incident and was completed on time
6947320 russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
6947321 if needed we reserve the right to boost these forces
6947322 i do not believe that these actions can seriously contribute to the stabilisation of the situation in the region
6947323 if that were to happen out of fear of protesters fear of unrest peru would someday remember it as the moment when change came to a halt and hundreds of thousands of people were condemned to poverty exclusion and marginalization
6947324 were very pleased to see one more tool that we can use to have whats a nutritious good product become even safer
6947325 were hearing on the order of three to five cents more per pound which is not all that much to guarantee safety

6947336 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6947337 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign
6947338 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6947339 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6947340 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6947341 im sure hell make a wonderful choice for our party and for our country and well just have to wait until next friday to find out the answer to those questions

6947369 theres still an incredible amount of money that they can drop into states
6947370 but this is just another example of how the republican brand is damaged goods in oregon and across the country
6947371 i really think its funny that senator obama wants to get into a debate on housing he is not exactly poor either
6947372 the government hopes that the reduction in gasoline and diesel prices will help to ease consumers burden as well as ease inflationary pressure
6947373 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6947374 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6947375 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6947376 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6947377 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6947378 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6947379 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6947380 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6947381 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6947382 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6947383 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6947384 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6947385 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6947386 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6947387 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6947388 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6947389 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6947390 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6947391 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6947392 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6947393 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6947394 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6947395 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6947396 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6947397 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6947398 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6947399 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6947400 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6947401 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6947402 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6947403 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6947404 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6947405 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6947406 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6947407 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6947408 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6947409 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6947410 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6947411 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6947412 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6947413 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6947414 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6947415 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6947416 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6947417 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6947418 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6947419 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6947420 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6947421 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6947422 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6947423 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6947424 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6947425 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6947426 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6947427 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6947428 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6947429 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6947430 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6947431 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6947432 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6947433 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6947434 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6947435 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6947436 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6947437 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6947438 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6947439 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6947440 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6947441 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6947442 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6947443 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6947444 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6947445 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6947446 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6947447 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6947448 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6947449 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6947450 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6947451 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6947452 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6947453 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6947454 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6947455 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6947456 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6947457 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6947458 this is a planning took where all things are going
6947459 he johnson said if you dont give me that purse im going to shoot you
6947460 she said well im not giving you my purse so youre gonna have to shoot me and he went pow
6947461 he didnt know who shot him he was just walking through the park
6947462 well we feel like we were wronged and when youre wronged some right gonna come your way so thats what we are looking for thats our attitude
6947463 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6947464 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6947465 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6947466 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6947467 if a guy has a setback and it keeps him out of it for a week or two i dont know that anyone will remember that any player missed a week of practice or was dealing with an issue
6947468 we are going to do everything we can to create a situation where merriman is not in pain and the leg gets some strength back
6947469 just like the clothes you wear and the way you style your hair the designs you create on your nails will show others your true individual character
6947470 i could live in your garden ill be good i promise
6947471 new yorkers can see how rooftop wind power would benefit the city
6947472 we received his letter and we appreciate the offer we sent them a copy of the request for expression of interest and encourage them to submit a proposal
6947473 we just love your sport it was so exciting and i just love triathalons
6947474 my dad opened his arms up to this guy let him in his life and then i feel like he was betrayed
6947475 my family and i are experiencing grief that is indescribable and at times unbearable every time i close my eyes the images in my head are of my dad in flames screaming hollering and running for his life while on fire in excruciating and traumatizing pain
6947476 if you have tendency to high blood pressure or heart disease saunas may be good for you
6947477 repeated sauna treatment improves blood vessel function resulting in improvement in cardiac function and symptoms
6947478 in addition to essential cardiac conditioning the deep heat of health mate sauna induces intense sweat that helps rid your body of toxins and wastes thereby strengthening your body s immune system with regular sessions the stiffness and pain associated with certain joint and muscle conditions diminishes dramatically while the profuse sweating achieved in the health mate carries off deeply imbedded impurities and dead skin cells for improved tone texture elasticity and color
6947479 if i could cue a heavenly chorus this is when i would do it
6947480 she would always be running around on the street going to the beach in the summer or jumping on the trampoline in the kais yard
6947481 i think they were just walking down the street and the officers saw them with what they knew to be expensive radios
6947482 a gente sabe que havia poucos ingressos duas pessoas da fam lia do caetano tinham lugar marcado e n o puderam sentar porque estavam dois convidados do theatro municipal

6947520 for a school that so desperately wants to be a bcs school and constantly tries to defend their talent they sure like to be on the other side of the equation i think byu fans are just delusional on their message board they seem to expect uni fans to bow down to the greatness and tradition that is cougar football uni fans respect their storied program but uni also has an amazing football tradition and we expect to win and that doesnt change just because we play a i a school i would love nothing more than for the panthers to put them in their place
6947521 homelessness crime racism oppression we have the resources and knowledge to fight and overcome these things
6947522 we need to look beyond our isolated situations to define our problems globally we cannot be child advocates in chicago or new york and ignore the web that links us with the children of india or palestine
6947523 in a truly just society there would be a greater sharing of the burden a fairer distribution of material and human resources
6947524 be aware of the social and moral universe we inhabit and be a teacher capable of hope and struggle outrage and action a teacher teaching for social justice and liberation
6947525 we saw a system at work we were radicalized we named that system imperialism and forged an idea of how to overthrow it we were influenced by marx but we were formed more closely and precisely by che ho malcolm x am lcar cabral mandela the third world revolutionaries and we called ourselves small c communists to indicate our rejection of what had become of marx in the soviet block sic we were anti authoritarian anti orthodoxy communist street fighters
6947526 the marriages between capitalism and education and capitalism and science have created a foundation for science education that emphasizes corporate values at the expense of social justice and human dignity
6947527 science pedagogy framed around social justice concerns can become a medium to transform individuals schools communities the environment and science itself in ways that promote equity and social justice creating a science education that is transformative implies not only how science is a political activity but also the ways in which students might see and use science and science education in ways transformative of the institutional and interpersonal power structures that play a role in their lives

6947548 but we were also shocked the community didnt come together more to oppose it there was an apathy about marriage equality in the mid 1990s nothing like we see now
6947549 this second part was intended to apply to federal programs such as survivor benefits social security and others
6947550 over the years and over the last year since ive been more active in the libertarian party ive talked with a number of individuals including members of outright libertarians a gay libertarian group and have come to view the second part as having been used as a club or the tail wagging the dog
6947551 it has become in effect a national definition of marriage this is not what i intended
6947552 but the only way you make mistakes the only way you get things done is by getting out there in the arena
6947553 as i mentioned to you all last night and i reiterate here today standing before you looking you in the eye the defense of marriage act insofar as it provided the federal government a club to club down the rights of law abiding american citizens has been abused misused and should be repealed and i will work to repeal that
6947554 the very foundations of our society are in danger of being burned the flames of hedonism the flames of narcissism the flames of self centered morality are licking at the very foundations of our society the family unit
6947555 we all must stand up and say we support this enough is enough we must maintain a moral foundation an ethical foundation for our families and ultimately for the united states of america
6947556 the purpose of the poster is to get students to see something they havent seen before
6947557 the chances are it challenges them to challenge something they thought they knew
6947558 either way ill see a positive but thats the way i think
6947559 im staying in here tonight it seems too stressful in there
6947560 it closes the book on a very very sad tragedy
6947561 unfortunately those who are still alive will always suffer from his actions
6947562 i thought the 1st group stepped it up and we needed to do that
6947563 last year we were surprised and delighted to hear that non jewish american soldiers were also benefiting from our service on dvd
6947564 many service people of other faiths went with their jewish buddies to the dvd screenings on navy ships and military bases and even joined in the prayers and songs
6947565 its a taste of home and spiritual comfort that they sorely miss
6947566 our service has a universal embracing quality and the fact that it is blessed with a few celebrities doesnt hurt
6947567 jewish soldiers serve in defense of freedom in frightening and lonely places far from home and jewish community
6947568 this effort to bring a virtual jewish community to them makes a world of difference
6947569 the agreement is false because it cannot stop the bullets
6947570 continue the jihad until the country somalia is ruled by islamic law
6947571 we are not taking sides just making a dramatic thriller and trying to explore racial bias
6947572 the agreement is false because it cannot stop the bullets
6947573 continue the jihad until the country somalia is ruled by islamic law
6947574 withdraw the us troops from iraq by end of 2011
6947575 the combat troops will withdraw from iraqi cities by june 2009 both the parties have agreed on this
6947576 the negotiators job is done now it is up to the leaders
6947577 there is a provision that says the withdrawal could be done even before 2011 or extended beyond 2011 depending on the security situation
6947578 the number of us military bases would depend on the size and the needs of the troops
6947579 we are very close we have a text but not the final agreement everything has been addressed
6947580 the us has gone very far in this agreement it is a very advanced agreement
6947581 its not a treaty so it would not require senate ratification or anything like that
6947582 the do it yourself television advertising system for small business owners

6947585 folks who put me in a passion may find me pipe after another fashion
6947586 if fcc chairman kevin martin gets his way your community will be inundated with even more mass produced celebrity gossip and infotainment and less local reporting and quality journalism more of the junk news that is making us sick
6947587 martin wants to super size big media allowing companies like gannett news corp and tribune to swallow up even more local tv newspaper and radio outlets martin wants to let one company own both the major newspapers and a tv station in your hometown drowning out the few remaining independent voices so that media moguls like rupert murdoch can expand their empires
6947588 its a business if you dont want it to be a business you had better get out

6947607 the kelpie dog is probably what saved his life and if he didnt have the dog with him certainly the outcome could have been substantially more serious in fact who knows how serious the weather up there was well below zero

6947621 i am deeply troubled when i see deliberate violations of federal laws to take our jobs
6947622 they are being brought to hawaii to work for specific time periods and then being taken back to the mainland
6947623 we have seen a pattern of individuals coming in groups to work on certain projects and certain jobs whether in agricultural construction or even the restaurant industry

6947626 cities and countries throughout the world are experiencing the destructive impacts plastic bags are having on their environment
6947627 a true jazz improviser can be his or her own rhythm section
6947628 the greatest battles of life are fought out every day in the silent chambers of ones own soul
6947629 i just sat back and realised i was doing something that every kid dreams of i had my destiny in my own hands yevgeniy was out of the competition and if i cleared that bar i was the gold medallist
6947630 i thought i am the sort of person who can stand up and take that sort of opportunity on and make the most of it
6947631 to have done it is a dream come true and its amazing
6947632 the reality of it hasnt sunk in but sailing over that bar after a clean clearance i really got to enjoy it
6947633 thats the good thing about my event you get that opportunity to fall to earth and that experience that other athletes dont get tonight i am lucky to be a pole vaulter and lucky to be an olympic gold medallist i am a very lucky guy right now
6947634 so much time and so much planning and so much effort
6947635 so many sacrifices so much has gone into this for me theres been so many people supporting me through all of this this is not just for me this is for all of them
6947636 its basically because of emma that i do pole vault
6947637 she held the world record at the time so i approached mark and asked him if i could start
6947638 hes been a big influence on my career hes an amazing man a very good coach and a very good friend i think hes probably going to be one of the happiest people in the world tonight so much of it belongs to him
6947639 i got to witness what he did in the lead up competitions what he did during the rounds and what he did in qualifying and in the final
6947640 he was so mentally tough he hadnt won that competition till he jumped that 5 95 to break the olympic record i took a lot from that and hes been in my thoughts a lot the last couple of days
6947641 i think id got to the point in my career where i needed a full time coach someone who could travel with me to competitions
6947642 and of course alex is one of if not the best coach in the world alex has taught me all sorts of things about technique about being professional about lifestyle about everything
6947643 both of my coaches have been the biggest influence in my life
6947644 without mark i would probably never have even discovered pole vaulting never would have had the early part of my career never would have learnt to just be a fierce competitor and go at things eyeballs out
6947645 without either of them all the pieces wouldnt have be there for this to have happened both must take even credit for it theyre both amazing guys and are two of my closest friends in the world
6947646 i think its a tribute to him now that hes coached an olympic gold medallist because he definitely deserves it
6947647 theres my training partners both from box hill in melbourne and from perth they are there everyday making it a pleasure to come to training it doesnt seem like work or a job or something that i have to do its something that i want to do and i love doing everyday
6947648 thats the thing i take out of this i love it i love what i do and this is just the icing on the cake
6947649 before most things in my life i get a feeling the last couple of weeks its just been crystalised in me that i can do this perhaps in my mind id already done it it was just a matter of playing it out in real life i guess
6947650 i was pushing too hard on the runway and i just really needed to let it go
6947651 my whole focus at the moment is about relaxing i jump much better when i relax but i wasnt that relaxed at the start of the competition
6947652 one of the big changes i have made is that i dont think about consequences of missing or clearing i didnt think about the interviews i would have to do if i missed and came fifth in the olympics none of that stuff
6947653 thats something that in the past i have worried about but i was just in the moment out there enjoying it and loving being in a bit of a dog fight with yevgeniy i loved having third attempt clearances with it all being on the line
6947654 my jumps improved technically so having all those third attempts was actually an advantage for me in the end
6947655 in 2006 i jumped 5 96 but in that competition i did it on about my third jump the thought of doing it on my 13th jump in the competition it would never have occurred to me that i would be able to do that
6947656 young guys like yevgeniy myself and brad walker well all work together to push up towards the world record and i wouldnt be surprised if it was gone in the next couple of years
6947657 my daughter has taught me more than i could ever imagine including that you need to take the time to stop and smell the roses or watch the ants as they take food to there home

6947697 were always evaluating whats happening in the marketplace and certainly something thats happening in the last couple of months is that sonys managed to sell some boxes so whether or not you like developing for that platform if theyve got millions of people connected to that platform and buying their games you have to take it seriously theyre in the race now so weve got to re evaluate that for what it is

6947706 it appears that since the widget competition is heating up so much that the widget companies are throwing together scripts without testing these scripts on large scale networks they are just throwing crap together to try to out perform each other
6947707 such and such script was causing problems on such and such networks and we asked on this date that it be fixed and followed up on this date and spence didnt fix it so hes banned till he fixes it right now they are hiding behind a policy but no information

6947711 our argument will be that the biden pick only underscores how inexperienced barack obama knows he is
6947712 obamas vote against funding our troops was an example of inexperience and poor judgment the fact that his more experienced running mate made the right call highlights obamas mistake
6947713 whereas to date that vote hasnt gotten a lot of attention
6947714 were not commenting on any aspect of any potential v p
6947715 i am not going to fail to protect these kids as long as we have a single solitary troop in iraq

6947717 en materia de derechos humanos chile sigue observando graves deficiencias
6947718 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
6947719 cuesti n que por lo dem s era de conocimiento de las autoridades sanitarias al momento de prometer la incorporaci n de la analgesia en el parto seg n se desprende de la lectura de la gu a cl nica respectiva
6947720 la promesa del auge de terminar con la discriminaci n contra las mujeres en el sistema de salud privado ha tenido tanta suerte como en el caso del sistema p blico pues el fondo de compensaci n interisapres reconoce la propia autoridad sanitaria demorar a cerca de 6 a os en ajustarse
6947721 el derecho a la libertad de expresi n juega tambi n un rol fundamental en el ejercicio de otros derechos pol ticos tales como el derecho de reuni n y protesta por tanto debe evitarse un acercamiento a las movilizaciones sociales que reduzca tales manifestaciones leg timas a meros actos de violencia y falta de raz n
6947722 un estado que no reconoce adecuadamente el derecho a la huelga de sus trabajadores tiene serias dificultades para honrar su compromiso con la dignidad del trabajo y con la humanizaci n del capital
6947723 sin perjuicio de su contribuci n a los derechos humanos las instituciones existentes son insuficientes e inefectivas para otorgar protecci n a los derechos de las personas los distintos proyectos de ley presentados por el ejecutivo y discutidos en el parlamento en los ltimos 17 a os incluido el del instituto nacional de derechos humanos no satisfacen los est ndares de independencia autonom a y representaci n judicial efectiva necesarios para su debida implementaci n en chile
6947724 algo que contradice el esp ritu y contenido del derecho internacional de los derechos humanos reconocido por el estado de chile y plenamente vigente
6947725 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6947726 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo en fin un informe sobre las violaciones a los derechos de las personas y grupos a nivel nacional pretende decir con toda claridad aquello sobre lo que el estado aprende a callar

6947739 i have been stonewalled even in my repeated request for something as simple as an index of olc opinions
6947740 on june 16 2003 i sent then attorney general john ashcroft a letter requesting an index of all memoranda and opinions rendered by the olc since january 2001
6947741 i reiterated that request on may 12 2004 and again directly to attorney general mukasey at an oversight hearing this july
6947742 we have never received this information nor were we ever provided with an explanation as to why the information was withheld examining the role of this justice department office in authorizing controversial activities is squarely within the oversight responsibilities of this committee in carrying out that responsibility we are entitled at the very least to know the subjects on which olc has provided final legal advice that after more than five years this committee has been refused even this simple request is unacceptable
6947743 unable to understand how statutes within this committees jurisdiction are being interpreted
6947744 to validate the statute an individual must have the specific intent to inflict severe pain or suffering
6947745 because specific intent is an element of the offense the absence of specific intent negates the charge of torture
6947746 such as death organ failure or serious impairment of body functions
6947747 if a government defendant were to harm an enemy combatant during an interrogation in a manner that might arguably violate a criminal prohibition he would be doing so in order to prevent further attacks on the united states by the al qaeda terrorist network
6947748 in that case we believe that he could argue that the executive branchs constitutional authority to protect the nation from attack justified his actions
6947749 among other issues we are examining whether the legal advice contained in those memoranda was consistent with the professional standards that apply to department of justice attorneys
6947750 the cia was seeking to determine the legal limits of interrogation practices for use in cases like that of abu zubaydah the qaeda lieutenant who was captured in march 2002
6947751 comprehensive index of all legal memoranda letters or opinions that were issued by the olc between september 11 2001 and the present to provide legal advice to the white house or any department or agency of the executive branch including the department of justice and its components

6947827 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6947828 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign
6947829 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6947830 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6947831 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking

6947836 it is because of doing one sin after another one sin after another until the heart dies and becomes black
6947837 their sins overcome their hearts until no good can get through to them
6947838 they used to consider the heart like a hand when a person sins his heart starts to scrunch up

6947852 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
6947853 perhaps real world climate sensitivity is very much below the ipccs estimates perhaps therefore there is no climate crisis at all the correct policy approach to a non problem is to have the courage to do nothing
6947854 i was impressed by an hour long academic lecture which criticized claims about global warming and explained the implications of the physics of radiative transfer for climate change
6947855 to me the value of this paper lies in its dispassionate but ruthlessly clear exposition or rather expos of the ipccs method of evaluating climate sensitivity the detailed arguments in this paper and indeed in a large number of other scientific papers point up extensive errors including numerous projection errors of climate models as well as misleading statements by the ipcc consequently there are no rational grounds for believing either the ipcc or any other claims of dangerous anthropogenic global warming
6947856 was 0 3 f cooler than the 1901 2000 average
6947857 its not ice melt but rather wind circulation that drives ocean currents northward from the tropics climate models until now have not properly accounted for the winds effects on ocean circulation so researchers have compensated by over emphasizing the role of man made warming on polar ice melt
6947858 i will make a commitment that al gore will be at the table and play a central part in us figuring out how we solve this problem hes somebody i talk to on a regular basis im already consulting with him in terms of these issues but climate change is real

6947864 the story of people from across the country who believe it is time for change
6947865 betrayed our values and left an economy out of balance
6947866 voices who share barack obamas vision of making america stronger and safer
6947867 a new tough foreign policy approach that is neither republican nor democratic
6947868 every seat will be a great seat as we listen to barack obama communicate the urgency of the moment highlight the challenges americans are facing and call on americans to come together to change the course of our nation
6947869 its a huge sh t sandwich and we are all going to have to take a bite

6947876 i gave up the second most important job in government for eight long years as roosevelts spare tire
6947877 the office until recently was completely meaningless in every way
6947878 its almost inevitable we keep seeing this growth of power
6947879 whoever the pick is will have a significant role as a strategist in terms of what the administration should do politically as an attack dog to go and say things the president might not be able to say and finally in terms of a policy maker
6947880 folks who dont get along during primary campaigns or people who are competitors can still be on each others ticket it tells you that
6947881 johnson hates kennedy johnson wants to be president that was kennedys effort to bridge the regional division in the party south and north the boston austin connection
6947882 it was a model of a successful partnership where it really enhanced the ticket allowed kennedy to win and achieve more prominence in the south than otherwise would have been possible
6947883 my ambition since my senior year in high school was to be a senator not everybody achieves their ambition i got to the level that i really had no great right to claim
6947884 walter mondale takes the biggest role that we had seen for a vice president and really starts to play a big role in policy in part because carter was unknown in congress and not liked and mondale was liked
6947885 he was popular not just with legislators but powerful interest groups and the democratic party
6947886 our relationship depended on trust mutual respect and an acknowledgement that there was only one agenda to be served the presidents
6947887 by the end of four years we had completed the executivization of the vice presidency ending two centuries of confusion derision and irrelevance surrounding the office
6947888 the revelation of that stuff dooms her as a positive in the campaign
6947889 there was no balance no regional balance no political balance but it was a message that they were trying to express and that seemed to work
6947890 that one day id have the chance to come here to madison square garden and be the warm up act for elvis
6947891 ive defined my job in exactly the same way for six years now to do everything i can to help him be the best president possible
6947892 we need a senator who is going to start addressing the issues now republican christine odonnell charged in a telephone interview that was followed by a news conference in dover
6947893 hes using the people of delaware and this senate career as a fallback to his aspirations to another career the situation is too critical for that
6947894 in this election i should be debating my real competition for this job odonnell said
6947895 and the people of delaware should get the opportunity to cast a vote for the person who is going to fulfill their term hes taken delawareans for granted and using the senate as a placeholder
6947896 whether people agree with my positions or not they should be outraged she said
6947897 this is precisely why our country and our state is in the situation it is
6947898 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
6947899 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
6947900 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
6947901 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
6947902 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
6947903 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
6947904 every single one of those quotations came from the campaign of 1960 when the republicans attacked john fitzgerald kennedy
6947905 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side
6947906 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6947907 at least i dont cake on the makeup like a trollop you c t
6947908 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6947909 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
6947910 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
6947911 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
6947912 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
6947913 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
6947914 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
6947915 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
6947916 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
6947917 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
6947918 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
6947919 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
6947920 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
6947921 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6947922 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6947923 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
6947924 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
6947925 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
6947926 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
6947927 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
6947928 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
6947929 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
6947930 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
6947931 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6947932 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6947933 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6947934 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6947935 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
6947936 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
6947937 if we use their tactics well lose the moral high ground
6947938 the fundamental basis of this nations laws was given to moses on the mount the fundamental basis of our bill of rights comes from the teachings we get from exodus and st matthew from isaiah and st paul
6947939 i dont think we emphasize that enough these days if we dont have a proper fundamental moral background we will finally end up with a totalitarian government which does not believe in rights for anybody except the state
6947940 a general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor
6947941 auster moves from the personal to the political august brill a retired book critic and widower lies in bed recovering from a car accident and conjures an alternate reality in which al gore won the 2000 election and sept 11 and the iraq war never happened instead theres a civil war its an intriguing idea and the brooklyn resident who is also a screenwriter translator and occasional song lyricist will read from the work at politics amp prose on thursday express man in the dark
6947942 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6947943 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6947944 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
6947945 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
6947946 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
6947947 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
6947948 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
6947949 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
6947950 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
6947951 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
6947952 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
6947953 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
6947954 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
6947955 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
6947956 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
6947957 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6947958 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
6947959 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
6947960 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
6947961 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
6947962 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
6947963 oh weve got more important things we have to do
6947964 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6947965 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6947966 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
6947967 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
6947968 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6947969 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6947970 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
6947971 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
6947972 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
6947973 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
6947974 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
6947975 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
6947976 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
6947977 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
6947978 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
6947979 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
6947980 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
6947981 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
6947982 and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
6947983 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
6947984 however nothing rallies the righties like a clinton a recent poll showed 49 of americans would never vote for hillary
6947985 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6947986 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6947987 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6947988 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6947989 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6947990 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6947991 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
6947992 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
6947993 to resign on the day of the service for walter lippmann
6947994 he seemed perfectly decent and reasonable during the negotiations it has been a disquieting experience for me it has really made me lose my faith in my judgment of people
6947995 peretz used to look like a jewish psychoanalyst now he looks like a jewish used car salesman page 783
6947996 when i first heard that he was after the new republic i wrote gil saying that if he ever got hold of it he would destroy it
6947997 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6947998 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6947999 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6948000 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6948001 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6948002 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6948003 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6948004 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6948005 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6948006 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6948007 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
6948008 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc

6948010 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him
6948011 the most inexperienced ticket in the history of the world
6948012 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
6948013 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
6948014 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
6948015 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
6948016 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
6948017 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment

6948019 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
6948020 must bring a narrative to his position as a change agent
6948021 we do have suspicion that the rationale for the rejections might be because of the protests and our activities
6948022 the right of a foreign national to work or stay in singapore is not a matter of entitlement or a right to be secured by political demand and public pressure
6948023 people got used to hearing something cool on a commercial and being like what band is this
6948024 if theyre out there really doing it if theyre playing at the echo then theyre not just being informed by how do i make this for a commercial theyre informed by their whole experience therefore you deliver something authentic
6948025 did you trick or treat on halloween as a child describe your childhood experiences
6948026 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6948027 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6948028 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6948029 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6948030 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
6948031 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure

6948038 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6948039 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6948040 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6948041 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6948042 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6948043 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6948044 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
6948045 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
6948046 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
6948047 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
6948048 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
6948049 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
6948050 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
6948051 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
6948052 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
6948053 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
6948054 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
6948055 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
6948056 trust me i have the inside dope that obvious thing that everyone already knows is true
6948057 i cant believe i actually miss jonah goldberg in tnr
6948058 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
6948059 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
6948060 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
6948061 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
6948062 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
6948063 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
6948064 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
6948065 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6948066 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6948067 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance

6948070 dalam suatu negara harus hanya ada satu hukum yang tidak membedakan agama ras dan keyakinan gagasan gus dur semacam itu lah yang menurut sejumlah penulis buku ini musykilat dalam nu dinilai sebagai salah satu contoh sekularisme yang sedang dikembangkan ke dalam tubuh nu amsar a dulmanan koordinator forum generasi muda nu saat ini telah terjadi sekularisasi di tubuh nu buktinya banyak kalangan nu terutama kalangan mudanya yang dengan tegas menghendaki tatanan politik sekuler salah satu alasannya adalah akan terjadinya islam dan menjadikannya sebagai warga negara kelas dua ini akan mengancam terjadinya disintegrasi bangsa
6948071 sejauh yang aku amati selama ini agama terjadi telahl kehilangan daya petunjuk petunjuk tuhan tidak mampu kita
6948072 nah diam diam kita menganut sekularisme walaupun dengan lantang kita sekitar 9 bulan kemudian tepatnya 13 maret 1970 kembali
6948073 sampai sekarang saya gagal memahami mengapa diantara kaum muslim masih saja ada yang menjadi penganjur sekularisasi seolah olah tidak mengetahui bahwa islam dan sekularisme terdapat antagonisme total
6948074 kami tidak mengutus engkau ya muhammad melainkan menjadi rahmat untuk semesta alam
6948075 aku bukan nasionalis bukan katolik bukan sosialis aku bukan budha bukan protestan bukan westernis aku bukan komunis aku bukan humanis aku adalah semuanya mudah mudahan inilah yang disebut muslim aku ingin orang memandang dan menilaiku sebagai suatu kemutlakan absolute entity tanpa menghubung hubungkan dari kelompok mana aku termasuk serta dari aliran mana saya berangkat
6948076 aku tak yakin apakah tuhan tega memasukkan romoku itu ke neraka
6948077 semua agama sama semuanya menuju jalan kebenaran jadi bukan islam yang paling benar
6948078 aku lebih berhak atas isa putra maryam di dunia dan di akhirat para nabi adalah satu ayah dari ibu yang berbeda beda dan agama mereka adalah satu

6948084 were in a good position from a performance and power perspective our 65 nm is really beating the comparable intel 45 nm products today in q4 we get to shanghai that gives 45 nm on the server so that lead that we have in performance and power savings gets increase even more as we get in the back end of the year

6948092 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6948093 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
6948094 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
6948095 most americans still dont know as marshall writes that on the campaign trail mccain frequently forgets key elements of policies gets countries names wrong forgets things hes said only hours or days before and is frequently just confused most americans still dont know it is precisely for this reason that the mccain campaign has now shut down the presss previously unfettered access to the candidate on the straight talk express

6948098 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
6948099 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
6948100 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
6948101 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
6948102 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
6948103 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6948104 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
6948105 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
6948106 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
6948107 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
6948108 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
6948109 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
6948110 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
6948111 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government

6948115 the external economic outlook for emerging east asia has dimmed amid prospects for slower growth tighter credit conditions and higher inflation heightened inflationary pressures will require more decisive tightening of monetary policies across much of emerging east asia
6948116 contractors may be forced to stop work delay or even abandon projects as a result of the costlier building materials this will cause a lot of hardship to many people clients designers suppliers sub contractors and 140 other related industries including the financial system
6948117 at the time when demand for asian goods is weakening in the us
6948118 a sharp drop in the price of cpo on the international front has raised alarm bells in malaysia as the government had targeted this vital edible oil to bring in up to rm60 billion in revenue this year early this year cpo fetched up to rm4 000 per tonne now it is rm3 095 per tonne
6948119 malaysias economic prospects have weakened as global demand for the countrys key hi tech exports falters
6948120 investors are already considering the situation as unstable they are already reconsidering their options in the country the new investors are possibly not looking at malaysia as a viable option and previous investors would be thinking of extracting their funds to be put in more stable and viable locations
6948121 the pakatan rakyat governments are no different from the previous ones after all they are hypocrites by copying bn media policy to serve their cynical self interests even if a state government funds and publishes a state magazine it should be run by an independent editorial board to provide free and fair news coverage
6948122 it is shocking how quickly the politicians from pr forget their election manifestos and promises it is not just that this action goes against the principles of good governance and would cause an environmental disaster there appears to be a lack of transparency with the mb chief minister deciding on the awards of the concession without an open tender
6948123 in the last few years many people have begun to lose faith in democracy as it has not been able to improve their economic and social lives
6948124 the people will distrust the civilian government indonesia will become a collapsing state and just a step away from anarchy
6948125 committed to getting the right equipment for the canadian forces at the right price for canadians with the right benefits for canadian industry
6948126 the ships will provide the vital lifeline of supply and support to other canadian navy ships as well as to army and air force assets in certain deployed operations
6948127 a key component of the canadian forces transformation the ships will help build a truly joint navy army and air force capability
6948128 as a maritime nation canada must have a strong and effective coast guard
6948129 the ongoing commitment of canadas new government to funding a renewed fleet will ensure a stronger coast guard and a stronger canada for years to come
6948130 these vessels are a key priority of the government of canada
6948131 for multiplatform games with a strong multiplayer component it is clear that the xbox 360 sku has an overwhelming popularity over the ps3 sku for example the xbox 360 version of rainbow six vegas 2 sold almost 4 5 copies for each playstation 3 copy sold within the first month of release a significant difference games with mass market appeal tend to fall below the current hardware ratio line as seen with lego indiana jones and assassins creed however games that have a stronger root to previous sony hardware systems such as madden 2008 devil may cry 4 burnout paradise gta iv and ncaa 2009 tend to produce the best results for the ps3 sku going forward i continue to expect mainstream titles to outperform below the cumulative hardware ratio line as well as brands that became popular on the original playstation and playstation 2 for games with a strong multiplayer component however i expect the xbox 360 versions to continue to have dominating market shares simply put no matter how large the ps3 base may get even if it passes the xbox 360 years from now i do not see how sonys playstation network could compete against xbox live xbox live will always have one differentiating feature that sony will likely never be able to replicate at least not in the current console cycle

6948142 hey dspace repo managers lets get together and talk about stuff
6948143 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
6948144 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
6948145 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
6948146 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
6948147 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
6948148 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
6948149 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
6948150 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
6948151 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
6948152 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
6948153 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
6948154 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
6948155 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
6948156 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
6948157 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
6948158 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
6948159 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
6948160 there is also renewed technical selling and talk again of demand destruction the dollar is strong again too
6948161 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
6948162 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
6948163 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
6948164 those people arent going to get intoxicated there and stay there
6948165 why do we want to risk their lives even more
6948166 people show up to frontier day saying i want barbecue were denying that ability
6948167 we in the council can say yes or no to whoever we want
6948168 im going to feel bad about it because im the one that gave them permission to do it
6948169 a rope is not going to keep somebody from going out into the public
6948170 council needs to adopt a policy thats crystal clear to everyone
6948171 weve had two sets of lawyers and one auditor that told us we needed a policy
6948172 it belongs to the voters we have no authority to do anything with that sales tax

6948400 we struggled the last couple years i was there and we could come back and get someplace
6948401 we got healthy and got better theyve never really gotten healthy i could never sit here and gloat knowing all these players i got close to were having to struggle
6948402 even if i was angry at certain things i would have a tough time not being able to root for those players individually
6948403 look at this we must be close to new york
6948404 im not here to make amends im here to do my job and thats to win ballgames
6948405 thats what id like to have been doing the last three years but it hasnt worked out that way to put my energy into thinking about the past and worrying about whats gone on it does me no good and it does the team no good
6948406 ive lived it ive lived with the frustrations and disappointments of letting myself down and my team down its disheartening but ive been through other adversity in my career surgeries injuries setbacks but you have to keep moving on ive been able to do that throughout my career and i plan on doing it starting saturday night
6948407 theres always an urgency to win especially this time of year we definitely have goals ahead of us that we need to attain and thats wins i want to be a big part of that but i have to go one start at a time
6948408 thats what i worked for to get where i am right now
6948409 im not where i want to be but im where i need to be so i need to keep moving forward ive passed every test as far as my rehab has gone but this is the big test to go out and help this team win ballgames
6948410 their front four is phenomenal any one of those guys couldve been up for mvp of the super bowl
6948411 its going to be a good task for us a good measuring point when you continue to get better you want to play the best well get that opportunity
6948412 potential is a scary word but i feel weve got the ingredients to be really good up front
6948413 they spent a lot of money and brought in some great players of course we expect to be better anything less than success is a failure
6948414 in the first few days it was a crazy ride
6948415 im just trying to buy as much time as possible
6948416 well wait to see how he does today and then well go from there
6948417 at this point lawrence will continue to treat the soreness in his knee through a rehabilitation program
6948418 winning series is of the utmost importance for us so winning the first game takes on a much bigger role
6948419 its hard to win series if you dont win the first game
6948420 thats a lot of hits more than i ever imagined
6948421 id have had to play until i was about 80 its amazing its consistency its work ethic its health its talent there are a lot of things that go into it
6948422 i had more bat tosses into the stands than hits
6948423 the biggest thing for me was going out there every day there were no setbacks no feelings of dizziness or loopiness or anything like that i just kept progressing every day
6948424 i knew i was going to come back i just didnt know when there was a plan and we stuck to it hopefully its over with and i wont have to deal with this type of injury again
6948425 if we can get what we had in the first part of the year itll be a great addition to our lineup and to our defense as well
6948426 its all going to come i just need to be a piece
6948427 jerrys going to look after me and give me some time to get my legs back and settle in
6948428 im still going to go in hard dont get me wrong but you might see my hands up a little higher
6948429 im not worried about that it happens in baseball if theyre going to be in there coming up high and tight ill take it hopefully it hits my elbow and not my head
6948430 im really excited to get back in here were in a playoff race
6948431 hopefully i can contribute help out do whatever it takes i feel great
6948432 there are no feelings of dizziness or loopiness anything like that
6948433 hopefully ill fall right into it right into the flow of things and just help out be a piece be a piece of the puzzle
6948434 i know that manager jerrys manuel going to look after me give me some days off just to get my legs settle in
6948435 if we get what we had with him in the first part of the year it will be a great addition to our lineup a tremendous addition to our lineup
6948436 whatever jerry wants i dont know whats in jerrys mind
6948437 its a tough decision very tough decision been wrestling with this
6948438 i dont want to come out of this game he said i had to give him the benefit of the doubt its only fair to him what hes brought to the team
6948439 i was glad to just test it it was really good to just bust it down the line
6948440 schneider every year starts to turn it on at the end and thats key for us
6948441 i think what he did tonight that was different from pittsburgh was when he got 0 2 he went out of the strike zone so bad they could not swing at them and when he came back they fouled them off
6948442 youve got to get hits in key situations the clutch hits weve been scratching the last few days
6948443 might see more of that as long as were seeing more of those types of results
6948444 are you kidding me the giants are going to destroy the jets
6948445 favre wont even be a factor after the giants defense rips his arm off
6948446 its way too hot for old man winter to win against eli
6948447 hes been very special i actually wanted to take him out in the sixth inning but he pleaded begged told me hed be ok he said i cant come out of this game i said ok go get em and he went out and got em
6948448 i told that i felt good that i just wanted to stay out there
6948449 i told him i dont want to come out of the game before roy

6948454 obviously been our most successful starter and its great to have him out there winning series is of the utmost importance for us
6948455 its consistency its health its talent its work ethic its starting young when i think about derek i think about him getting well beyond 3 000 hits
6948456 the last time andrew fintoff batted like that with me was at edgbaston against australia in 2005 we gave him a new role at number five the man is a superstar i am fortunate to have a bloke like that who i can throw the ball to say knock over the stumps
6948457 we asked a lot of the players but we wont be resting on our laurels the team were brilliant we started off well and built a good foundation
6948458 and this is the stage where steve harmison belongs he should be playing in front of 30 000 40 000 50 000
6948459 we know they can hit the ball but if we get our execution right we should never be going for 98 in the last ten there is a feeling in the dressing room we can do a lot better
6948460 we pride ourselves on being better than that but england deserved their win they played with a lot more skill
6948461 thats a tough team to pitch behind and it seemed like i was pitching behind all night
6948462 looking back it seems like i was never in a pitchers count where i was ahead of them these are tough guys to pitch behind it wasnt one of those days where i commanded the ball well
6948463 id rather them swing and hit the ball than give them a free one like that
6948464 people are saying we control our own destiny and its true but youve got to win those games the weekend is not over well see what we can do saturday hopefully we can pull out a win and give us a shot to take the series
6948465 im looking forward to face somebody other than joe inglett leading off the game
6948466 ill be excited that maybe lyle overbay wont be in the lineup and recognize everything that comes out of my hand
6948467 if there isnt common ground then he has a decision to make about whether or not to visit the governor general
6948468 if parliament comes back there will be a confidence motion at the first available opportunity according to the bloc
6948469 well have one last good faith attempt in terms of a private meeting between the prime minister and opposition leaders
6948470 is trying to save face trying to find an excuse to once again break his word this time on the fixed election date law
6948471 the official excuse that parliament is not functioning is phony
6948472 what is true is that the prime minister does not want people to realize he has ethical problems in his government and to what extent he has badly prepared us as a country for the economic slowdown we face
6948473 if he pulls the plug on the parliament without even having the members of the house come back to their seats and show what they can do then hes showing contempt for the democratic institutions and for the fact that canadians did not elect him to a majority government only to a minority
6948474 this is the sort of thing that they usually trot out at election time
6948475 he gives it his all on every second of every play you see that and youre like youve got to do the same thing
6948476 you see a guy playing that hard youll do anything not to let him down
6948477 you hear a lot of things about kobe but i had no idea he was such a basketball junkie
6948478 he studies all the film talks basketball all the time knows everything
6948479 were good friends so none of what he does surprises me
6948480 kobe was the guy he was like i want to guard manu
6948481 he always wants to guard the other teams best player
6948482 the things he does out there theyre not about putting the ball in the basket
6948483 brazil was doing its part in combating international organized crime
6948484 things are taking place in a favorable opinion the united states at present seems to be standing alone so much is its
6948485 i only recently learned that the tape i dreamed i heard playing over the loudspeaker in my cell had been real it had been broadcast outside the prison and had come to the attention of my father
6948486 if i had known at the time my father had heard about my confession i would have been distressed beyond imagination and might not have recovered from the experience as quickly as i did
6948487 there are too many marketers and charlatans out to make a fast buck on the expense of the vulnerable acid reflux sufferers simply cannot afford to spend their hard earned money on pricey heartburn cures and quick fixes only to be disappointed time and time again
6948488 is that even the so called natural approaches to the treatment of acid reflux that are aimed to cure acid reflux from within are either unrealistic impractical or are often the same one dimensional gimmick cures disguised as holistic solutions
6948489 there is simply no other way but the holistic way
6948490 the heartburn no more program was born out of these necessities
6948491 im only 3 weeks into the heartburn no more program and by following the principals of your program i am already experiencing significant relief in my acid reflux condition i have been battling with acid reflux food intolerance and leaky gut syndrome for 7 years and i am so thankful for the invaluable knowledge i have received from your book i will definitely recommend your book to anyone suffering from digestive disorders and chronic heartburn people can surely use your knowledge and expertise to recover form this painful condition and take responsibility over their health and well being this program is the answer to my prayers
6948492 but i sure am proud to have created a program that truly helps other acid reflux sufferers to end their physical pain and anguish for good and gain their lives back
6948493 the day that the disappearance of the indigenous communities in the jungles and mountains was avoided
6948494 this is a new dawn for the people of this country and for all peruvians who wish to develop in freedom not in oppression
6948495 if that were to happen out of fear of protesters fear of unrest peru would some day remember it as the moment when change came to a halt and hundreds of thousands of people were condemned to poverty exclusion and marginalisation
6948496 the existence of two or more working class parties in a number of countries in some cases for several decades raises basic questions as to whether single structures in the long run are desirable or achievable
6948497 the existence of two or more working class parties in a number of countries in some cases for several decades raises basic questions as to whether single structures in the long run are desirable or achievable
6948498 entrei na internet e me deparei com fotos da mulher fil na praia ela somente uma das carnes do meu rod zio adoro onde isso vai chegar apesar de ter minhas cr ticas a esse fen meno das mulheres frutas o que vejo de fato o que eu j sei h muito tempo mulher brasileira boa gostosa tem carne tem bund o tem cox o e muitos outros es
6948499 fui criticada sacaneada e por que n o dizer humilhada com piadinhas sobre minha forma f sica por ser justamente esse tipo de mulher agora vejo mulheres com o corpo igual ou parecido com o meu sendo admiradas pelos homens e principalmente taxadas de gostosa pela m dia o que ser que aconteceu quem mudou
6948500 its exciting to come out in the first half and move the ball like we did
6948501 all the feeback im getting is that harry will be fine
6948502 tivemos que fazer o melhor pois ela n o era bonita o suficiente
6948503 estou orgulhosa de ter sido escolhida para cantar pelo menos

6948507 no debemos sorprendernos del mal que sale de la boca de alguien que acus a sus padres de haber abusado sexualmente de ella
6948508 dr thaksin sangat terbuka dalam masalah ini ia thaksin mengatakan kepada saya jika anda menginginkan saya mundur dari jabatan direktur klub saya tidak keberatan sepanjang tidak mengubah hal lain kepemilikan saham
6948509 itu adalah salah satu pertimbangan mengapa kami hendak menonaktifkannya dari jabatan direktur ia merasa sangat malu dengan semua pihak klub maupun liga primer ia tidak pernah mengharapkan hal ini
6948510 on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
6948511 by the time i met him he is a professor of education at the university of illinois we served on a board together that had republicans bankers lawyers focused on education
6948512 the pullback of russian troops and units passed without incident and was completed on time
6948513 russia is not in compliance and that russia needs to come into compliance now
6948514 put yourself in a state of mind where you say to yourself
6948515 we are looking at something verging on the incredibly bizarre as she got older she got shorter and broader and was reduced to a giant gelatinous blob carrying many thousands of eggs
6948516 her shape was likely to have affected her behavior and ability to hunt i cant imagine her jetting herself around in the water at any great speed and she was too gelatinous to have been a fighting machine
6948517 its not sitting down there sipping on cups of tea or anything like that
6948518 didnt we graduate from high school why are you still wearing a jersey
6948519 when are you to old to be wearing the kit outside of the game
6948520 the original equal rights amendment which most of you have probably never heard of
6948521 the one that would directly affect 51 of the people in this room
6948522 never give up until the project is buried so they can dance on its grave
6948523 my view is theyve had their go in the 1960s theyve got other goals theyre setting for themselves
6948524 i think its our turn to host a commonwealth games
6948525 this state needs livening up it needs a bit of excitement
6948526 it needs some vision for the future and i think something like a bid for the commonwealth games in 2018 is where we should be heading
6948527 i have no idea why ive been summonsed other than a phone call from that i made to mr minnitis solicitor to say that i may be may be required to give character evidence as he was one of my constituents
6948528 trees and green spaces are exceptionally good for our mental state
6948529 born and raised in dallas i have family here two young boys and i want to try to leave it better for them
6948530 we cannot manage an asset that we dont fully understand and cant fully recognize to begin with
6948531 it sure seems theres a better faster way to do it
6948532 using remote sensing we can save a lot field work
6948533 we know were not just sticking trees in willy nilly were trying to find the exact spots that will have the most amount of benefit
6948534 which is where we wanted to start in the beginning
6948535 but goldy was cool with this whatever happened he understands what hes got a univeristy and a life hes very happy in
6948536 my decision came at the end of last week when it was demonstrated to the nation that mccain and this bush white house have learned
6948537 come on mum whats it going to be are you going to turn left or right
6948538 i think the course is in such good shape thats why the scoring is good
6948539 i think as we get further along the scoring could get a little bit better just because guys will find a way to play it understand it a little bit more and feel a little bit more comfortable with what they are doing out there
6948540 i probably hit it better than i did yesterday but nothing went in
6948541 i need to go out today and have a good day and shoot 6 or 7 under
6948542 i tried hard but struggled to focus this afternoon it really is a knockdown after the last couple of weeks
6948543 he should have thought of who hes been with to make him get to todays position
6948544 i think its trying to reinvent the wheel as far as statistics are concerned
6948545 its not the way statistics have been run thus far
6948546 why should i feel bad im doing my best it wasnt good enough it ended up working out with the team getting the win and i ended up getting the win as a reliever
6948547 but i think if you come in and say youre sorry to a person it puts things in perspective that youre not trying your best as a teammate you dont need to say youre sorry if youre doing what youre trying to do
6948548 were going to be in the same situation weve been in all year weve got an outstanding right fielder randy winn its not going to be easy getting nate the playing time you want to get him guys are going to need days off well do what we can to get him some playing time
6948549 onze afrikaanse vrienden vonden dat wij super racistisch zijn want we willen niet het volle bedrag betalen aan een stervende negertje die probeerde er wat bij te verdienen
6948550 j t will be our starter going into the season
6948551 hes got very good command of the offense and played well in all three preseason games but now its time to get ready for the season
6948552 the perception will be wrong if that is the perception
6948553 because i think he is getting better and better right now
6948554 i dont see it as a problem we want to play our best players alex has a lot of ability and a lot of potential and hes going to be a good quarterback in this league hes just not there at this point
6948555 this has not been a case of shaun and alex not performing well
6948556 this has been a case of j t performing well
6948557 in fairness to john and jed scot and i kept them apprised
6948558 ik had niet gedacht dat ik een berg zo mooi zou kunnen vinden
6948559 the media in the u s reflects the interests of the u s government of the u s imperialists
6948560 gloria featured on russia today television regarding russia georgia war
6948561 say no to war has been justin raimondos slogan for over a decade from the u s intervention in bosnia to the war in iraq and afghanistan now he has denounced u s support for georgia
6948562 nearly 90 million pay tv viewers in europe north america and south africa regularly watch russia today
6948563 as well as on cable networks in practically every country of europe
6948564 the station is part of the state owned news conglomerate ria novosti and news organizations routinely refer to it as state run including the new york times which has said it was created to promote pro kremlin views
6948565 i think it is important at this point for all sides to show restraint and to stop this armed conflict i think it is very important for the united states to work with the un security council and others in the international community to make sure that we are beginning to bring this conflict to a close
6948566 some major newspapers are beginning to tone down their initial anti russian stance
6948567 surprised by the media bias over events in south ossetia
6948568 a deliberate misinformation campaign was carried out by the united states
6948569 it is possible that in late october it will scare americans into voting for mccain and abandoning obama
6948570 so eight girls walk into teashi champagne and a bag full of le boulangerie in hand
6948571 i like the look and the virtual tour it looks professional which is what we try to be
6948572 it gives everyone an opportunity to see our things and makes it easier to shop because they dont physically have to drive here
6948573 i think its changing everything people are getting spoiled not have to drive to find what they are looking for
6948574 jewelry is the hardest thing to buy for a woman
6948575 my problem is that im almost pathologically bad about writing things down
6948576 you know i probably need to get on a normal sleeping schedule before college starts
6948577 dont go to sleep tonight so youll be able to go to sleep early tomorrow
6948578 what a lovely shop with an even lovelier selection of goods
6948579 living in sf you can find a mani pedi place as easy as a coffee shop and they are cheap too
6948580 just visited amp enjoyed the new pizza joint amp in all places west oakland near the main post office and west oakland bart
6948581 i totally agree that the carnitas super burrito is great
6948582 no i dont think we even have an answering machine
6948583 that definitely hasnt sunk in because im still the same guy i was yesterday
6948584 i still havent slept so i havent had a chance to wake up and be someone new i guess
6948585 i might have a nap this afternoon and wake up and be a new person or be in a new life
6948586 but its all feeling pretty much the same im just around the same group of athletes i was a few days ago and weve all got the same vibe amongst us
6948587 the london bus is an iconic image that will be recognisable to anyone watching anywhere in the world and it will be in complete contrast to what has gone before
6948588 we wanted to do a show that is irrepressibly british iconic eclectic and witty
6948589 we will take a london approach and will be different our approach is to keep it simple and creative to make it youthful and diverse entertaining and fun
6948590 ever since i moved out of the tenderloin ive been at a loss trying to get my hungover noodle craving fixed
6948591 the withdrawal of russian forces has gone without incident and was concluded according to plan at 19 50 moscow time
6948592 the troop pull back has been started at a rate to make sure that the russian troops be within the zone of responsibility of the russian peacekeeping contingent by the end of august 22
6948593 we are not going to correct this plan or increase the speed of withdrawal
6948594 if you cant say something nice dont say anything at all
6948595 i have been many times and will only rate it for my experience this past tuesday june 10 2008
6948596 oh we had a new policy that there will not be any re orders for ribs it will be my mistake and any additional re orders will be comming out of my paycheck

6948603 dont worry its really not a problem heres your baggage claim check just go to gate 9a and board your flight
6948604 oh we already hired someone but we wanted to hear what you had to say because we thought he sounded knowledgeable
6948605 theres a very interesting balance of frustration versus hoarding behaviour that as a loyalty company you need to monitor and keep at a particular point
6948606 theres no hard and fast rule on this but it appears its somewhere around 80 per cent
6948607 i know that if we went higher than that people would actually spend the currency faster they would tend to and i dont mean to sound pejorative they would fritter it away and they would never get the big reward that we know influences their long term brand loyalty and their behaviour
6948608 yesterdays man celebrated by a bunch of craven bootlicking hacks who cant find anything else worth writing about yawn
6948609 those of you who believe in those views and work for those views should have the confidence to go out and begin the task again of engaging with the australian people and persuading them and winning their confidence and their trust for the next election which can make australia strong again and put us back on a path to where we want to be

6948755 the ability for suppliers to enhance their company information providing details on their products and services is a great advance in the rfp depot network until now public purchasers have had to rely on generalized commodity codes and the shot gun approach
6948756 by viewing the information attached to the suppliers information in rfp depot and by using the direct link to the suppliers web site research will become quicker and easier for our buyers

6948806 shes super athletic and can play with her feet very comfortably for her first regular season game i thought she was outstanding
6948807 she played a composed and mistake free game and when we needed a couple of key saves she made them
6948808 she probably wins 60 or 70 percent of the balls at midfield off of punts and goal kicks without watching the film i think she may have been our best player on the field tonight shes just a tremendous competitor and has a great will to win
6948809 i wouldve liked to have gotten the ball more to the left side of the goal but i thought i got solid contact on it
6948810 her composure in front of goal is great her strike rate for her chances is great and she puts the ball on target which is something we had a bit of trouble doing tonight

6948935 the event felt especially energetic since there were so many new ideas about distributing movies and connecting with audiences and lots of folks eager to hear those ideas
6948936 hollywood believes large scale broadband video distribution would only destroy proven value fail to provide alternative value and alter a business model that is still far from being in decline
6948937 although 180solutions has come to realize that third party distribution can be hard to police we believe it is possible to properly balance who we do business with while providing monetization methods for the long tail of web publishers and content developers
6948938 the advertisers benefit by repeat display of the name of their products
6948939 when i came to this slide during my presentation in san jose i asked the audience how many were familiar with the long tail concept
6948940 as the data indicates recommendation tools can provide important stimuli for increasing the diversity of music from genres to artists to which consumers are exposed recommendation tools can be a crucial component in driving demand for back catalogs as a source of high margin revenue for rights holders as well as toward niche artists and music that they otherwise would

6948948 believes that media that is meant to expose the lapses in government and in public life cannot obviously be regulated by government else it would lack credibility
6948949 therefore falls upon the journalistic profession to evolve institutional checks and safeguards specific to the electronic media that can define the path that would conform to the highest standards of rectitude and journalistic ethics and guide the media in the discharge of its solemn constitutional duty
6948950 censure emanating from a jury of peers would indisputably affect the credibility of a channel
6948951 a channel acting in breach of established guidelines could hardly defend its motives or suggest that it was acting fairly if it is censured by a jury comprising its peers
6948952 imperil not just independent journalism but the very process of investigation itself it therefore has become imperative that news channels lay down guidelines procedural safeguards and establish a body that would act as a watchdog and a grievance redressal forum

6948957 what is the meaning then of roman catholic ecumenism what is the meaning of the new way of addressing non roman christians as separated brethren instead of as heretics and schismatics as in the past what is the meaning of the praise given to the spiritual fruits to be found in non roman churches and what is meant by accepting the witness of their devotion and their theological insights is not all this an effort aimed at absorption is not this kind of ecumenism as some protestant christians suspect merely a continuation of the counter reformation with other more accommodating methods

6948969 i like driving this track it is different to other street circuits we have had and yesterday when i walked it i thought it would be fun today just confirmed that impression for me
6948970 there are some very quick parts and almost everywhere there is a lot of room it is maybe similar to some of the north american circuits used in the past
6948971 they have done a really good job we have got off to a good start but it is too early to say where we are in relation to the opposition i think overtaking will be difficult as always
6948972 i hope i dont need to worry about it so i am concentrating on getting the best position for qualifying
6948973 considering the dustiness of the track we made a very promising start on the set up this morning we were able to go faster on each run without changing too much and had a good baseline for the afternoon session
6948974 in p2 this afternoon our adjustments were again spot on but the sheer volume of traffic meant that it was difficult to confirm immediately our final set up changes i think we are in pretty good shape and i am looking forward to saturday
6948975 the track was very green this morning which meant there was little point in making big changes to the car
6948976 but we made some in the afternoon and they seemed to pay off i felt the car was working well by the end of the session and the balance was good
6948977 this is a good start to the weekend for us all and i must say that it is a great circuit

6949044 y was serious and dark and grounded in reality where doctor who is quite playful it does affect my mood at the table ive noticed
6949045 the trick is to find a way to graphically impersonate these characters their gestures and expressions so that it feels natural in the end its either spot on or something your uncle does at christmas dinner i dont know how close i am to the former fingers crossed its not the latter
6949046 maybe im just happy to be drawing so many men after drawing a gazillion women for the last seven years
6949047 that only just occurred to me a couple of weeks ago and it actually made me giggle
6949048 the power of the subconscious is a surprising and mysterious thing
6949049 at first i was thinking to have something elaborate on the floor beneath the doctor to make the first page splash really pop
6949050 but it should also have some meaning behind it and not just be some pretty eye candy that made me think of the seal of rassilon but since it makes an appearance on the next page it shouldnt be the actual seal and celtic knot work wouldnt really work but i wanted something like that elaborate and a little complex like the trouble hes in
6949051 i went online and started looking at tile work and this one piece jumped out at me it was an italian floor created by cosmati
6949052 i know it seems like a crazy amount of extra work for an easter egg but its those things that make the work more fun as you go its something i did a lot of on y and its a hard habit to break
6949053 when i was six i lived in finland for about a year and what television there was and of those the ones in english were all itv shows the phoenix and the carpet the muppets toms mindnight garden i claudius and grange hill they were all shows i enjoyed and they had a really specific look about them we later moved to toronto and i remember my aunt watching this show on tvontario that had that look there was a guy in a crazy long scarf and a girl dressed like andy pandy running around a nuclear power plant as a disembodied rock hand growled eldrad must live and it scared me silly i was hooked
6949054 i love the new stories like i loved those old fourth doctor ones especially with tennant who captures the doctors personality so beautifully that manic enthusiasm
6949055 but now theres the added bonus of seeing it from an adult perspective theres more of an appreciation for the story probably the best way to put it baker is the doctor of my childhood but tennant is my doctor today
6949056 there are a bunch of stories percolating in my head that id like to write
6949057 the human shield thing works better if you use someone who hasnt shot me
6949058 casey doesnt really have a calm center he has an angry center
6949059 gives a new perspective on the english civil war through the eyes of angelica fanshawe riseborough who is drawn to the anti monarchist cause at a time when england executed its king in favor of an alternative form of government
6949060 considering the british traditions of free speech and the individual and the british suspicion of organized crowds we would want to avoid the leni riefenstahl connotations which were there in beijing and the ceremony was too long
6949061 i never want to be pigeon holed im an entertainer whether im entertaining a teenage girl whos watching me judging on a tv show a young guy watching doctor who or a couple watching torchwood the fact i can diversify is great
6949062 i was young and now i am old yet i have never seen the righteous forsaken or their children begging bread
6949063 a good man leaves an inheritance for his childrens children
6949064 if anyone does not provide for his relatives and especially for his immediate family he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever
6949065 maybe the best show at the uptown since zappa played there in the mid 80s

6949067 i had high expectations and they blew them away i know its comparing apples to oranges but springsteen has big shoes to fill this weekend

6949069 it took me awhile to let things go you just have to work through that stuff it takes a few years divorce is really awful a lot of people go through that more than once and i dont know how they do it i mean once was enough for me
6949070 were in this time when you have to be young and pretty weve gone back to that
6949071 there were a lot of people 10 or 15 years ago who were putting on funny clothes and playing some kind of country music who were dabbling
6949072 blue mountain was really authentic they were blending country blues and rock in an interesting way that only two or three bands were doing
6949073 it was one of the most happening places culturally in the country
6949074 fat possum records was based there so you had r l burnside and junior kimbrough and all those guys and oxford had this literary scene with larry brown and barry hannah there was a lot going on and we were kind of musically in the center of it
6949075 theres probably going to be periods of time where im probably not going to be making enough money from music and ill have to get an additional job
6949076 before we sold enough records and we made enough money on the road where we could really not worry about that for a while live show attendance has been up and down for everybody not just for us weve been lucky because we still have the markets where we did really well and were still doing really well but that could go away too
6949077 with the introduction of printing the efforts of the censors became hopeless germany led the way by the time martin luther produced his own new testament in 1522 there were fourteen different printed versions in german and four in dutch

6949086 why is it that joe biden is the first in his family ever to go a university why is it that my wife is the first in her family to ever go to college is it because our fathers and mothers were not bright is it because they didnt work hard my ancestors who worked in the coal mines of northeast pennsylvania and would come after 12 hours and play football for four hours its because they didnt have a platform on which to stand
6949087 when the truth emerged dukakis was forced to fire his campaign manager john sasso and political director paul tully the two who had orchestrated the maneuver

6949095 if you are reading this then you are already dead
6949096 a death threat by no means is a legitimate form of political expression
6949097 well he knows his stuff pretty well it may not be his absolute strongest point but he sure knows a lot more about economics than mccain does but he has this tendency which i worried about even a year ago to say lets put partisan divisions of the past behind us and then talk about economics as if both parties have made mistakes and its time to move forward hes been reluctant to drive home this message that republicans now have a long track record of really screwing up the economy and democrats do much better in his big economy speech on august 1 he seemed to go out of his way to avoid pointing out that the bad times were when republicans were in office and the good times were when democrats were in office hopefully hell get over that
6949098 well i hope so this economy issue is as ready made as you can imagine and this has happened in the past gore made a huge comeback when he started emphasizing these economic issues and that was at a time in 2000 when there was a kind of assumption that prosperity was here to say and that it really didnt matter who was in the white house so theres tremendous opportunity now to highlight those differences but its not just a matter of sniping of saying that phil gramm is still advising mccain its driving home that we have now got decades of experience that the policies of the right wing the policies that mccain has endorsed dont work for working americans
6949099 sure and there are multiple models here al gore did it and again that helped him a lot not quite enough but a lot bill clinton if we could just find some way of having barack obama give bill clintons acceptance speech to the 1992 democratic convention that was a terrific speech it was full of very simple language saying look under these guys the operators the wheeler dealers have prospered while ordinary people who are trying to make a living have done very badly and we can change that i dont think the public cares much about the 15 point policy proposals although people like me care but you need to make the simple point that it really matters who is in the white house and that people with an r after their name have been bad for workers
6949100 well heres what we know according to one of my colleagues larry bartels in the politics department working americans really do vastly better under democratic administrations its a little bit of a puzzle for economists who want to be able to be shown the policy tools that make that happen and we can only get at some of it but the historical facts show that it makes a big difference then there are a lot of things that are mostly under the radar like whos appointed to the national labor relations board what kinds of decisions are made about workers rights and bargaining how is union organizing treated you know if we got the employee free choice act which is something obama is supporting and that mccain is dead set against that can make a huge difference
6949101 yeah it could make a major comeback im not especially wal mart is the root of all evil but its a giant corporation that is un unionized and it could be unionized and that in itself would tilt the bargaining position of labor in america theres a huge difference between canada and the united states on unions theres this country up north they even speak the same language eh and yet they preserve a strong union movement its a political thing that weve become a country in which labor is so weak
6949102 there are several things we can do first of all healthcare we can assure every american affordable healthcare every other advanced country does it its a uniquely american thing not to we have a level of brutality and risk in there that nobody else has and its something that can be solved within a year given sixty seats in the senate and a democratic president willing to do it you know bill clinton was a president who had a hostile congress for 6 of his 8 years and even so labor did a whole lot better workers did a whole lot better during those 8 years than they did during the republican administrations on either side give us a democratic president with a progressive agenda and congress on his side and you may be amazed by what can happen
6949103 i think people are prepared to be smarter on this but mccains repetition of big untrue statements has to be countered by obamas repetition of big true statements you know hes got to be on message hes got to be punching
6949104 yes although for what its worth its not as bad this time around as it was in 2000 there actually have been more news stories pointing out that these things dont add up maybe ive just had my standards debased but while the coverage is pretty bad its not as bad as it was in 2000
6949105 oh look when i was hired by the times the idea was that id be writing about you know business deals and financial crises and scandals in other countries because america was a sensible solid place and i could just go back to doing what i thought i was going to be doing then
6949106 well i think that paul krugman is right on this is a moment for this message americans are suffering theyre fearful theyre anxious and obama has not been the most populist candidate in the primaries john edwards drove the populist issues and then hillary clinton did as well whats interesting is that in the last 48 hours obama is back on message and its a hillary message its like im fighting for you its not the sweeping change message because for many people in ohio and pennsylvania change sometimes means a factory closed a job lost so i think theres an opening millions of americans want a more active government on their side and john mccain offers more of the same the corporate economic trade agenda thats devastating the middle class
6949107 the conventional wisdom among democrats at least has always been that if you take a populist message out on the campaign trail you leave yourself open to the charge of class warfare bizarrely enough
6949108 he does have a problem here and its that angry young black man aggressively going after old white guy is going to send shivers through the viscera of a lot of particularly older white voters i would suggest that barack obama needs to hire a couple of good comedy writers because the way to go after mccain and mccain is a target rich environment as weve seen that over the last few weeks is with humor he did it with the housing thing made fun of the guy mccains incoherent much of the time make fun of that but obama cant be too aggressive

6949113 i feel like i have less pressure this time just because the way swimming works is youre validated through the olympics and you only have that opportunity every four years
6949114 when i was six years old i dreamt of being in the olympics but that really meant nothing at that point i had no idea what the olympics even were let alone how you would get there i was thirteen years old when i realized it was a possibility that i could make the olympic team and i didnt even think of swimming professionally until that actually happened

6949189 after three days of a steady downward spiral in public discussion of the piece i have just given my agreement to the organizers of the leipzig games convention to simply turn off the installation invaders while i realize the dangerous precedent of allowing the lowest common denominator dictate what is and is not a valid form of expression unfortunately the current tone has totally obfuscated the original aims of the piece while i take full responsibility for the uncomfortable ambiguity of certain aspects of this work it was never created to merely provoke controversy for controversys sake and unfortunately this is what the piece has now become the american response to this work has been frankly immature and lacking the sophistication and consideration that other parts of the world have so far shown the work contrary to previous reports i am an american and it saddens me that we as a people remain so profoundly unable to process this event outside of some obscure but tacitly understood criteria of purely anesthetized artistic representation due to these profound misunderstandings i simply feel that from an artistic point of view the work has lost the ability to have any valuable impact poetic or otherwise i have not been pressured by the leipziger messe nor by the computerspiele museum in this decision to the contrary they have offered their support in defending the right of artists to speak freely and in whatever context they may choose

6949331 i dont want to come out of this game he said i had to give him the benefit of the doubt its only fair to him what hes brought to the team
6949332 i was glad to just test it it was really good to just bust it down the line
6949333 schneider every year starts to turn it on at the end and thats key for us
6949334 i think what he did tonight that was different from pittsburgh was when he got 0 2 he went out of the strike zone so bad they could not swing at them and when he came back they fouled them off
6949335 youve got to get hits in key situations the clutch hits weve been scratching the last few days
6949336 might see more of that as long as were seeing more of those types of results
6949337 i kept us in the game we were never out of it
6949338 we got the at bats we needed in the end
6949339 to hold them to four runs the way i pitched the last two times against them this was pretty good
6949340 if you can hold them to one run an inning its not as demoralizing to your team we were able to stay in and come back and win it
6949341 i was trying to be too perfect with it and i was far from it on that one
6949342 the key to the whole game was we didnt get abreu out at all
6949343 he wont chase bad pitches thats probably why he is as good of a hitter as he is
6949344 i think weve done our homework on him and faced him enough so that we have a pretty good idea how he pitches
6949345 what you have to do is make him throw it over the plate you cant chase it
6949346 the ones cabrera threw at the end might have had double hit me on them
6949347 i didnt pitch my greatest it was six innings of survival it was like boy scouts just making do with what i had
6949348 im looking forward to facing somebody other than joe inglett leading off the game
6949349 ill be excited that maybe lyle overbay wont be in the lineup and recognizes everything that comes out of my hand
6949350 i knew he was a good catcher but hes a great receiver
6949351 hes really good he blocks the ball better than i thought he did what he brings behind the plate a wealth of knowledge against the hitters is great ive enjoyed throwing to him i think weve gelled pretty quickly
6949352 the first day there was a little bit of uncertainty early because i wasnt sure how hitters react to him you use those first three of four innings to get a bit of a read today there was much more rhythm
6949353 weve had nights like this where weve come in here and im explaining why we lost or how we lost we found a way to turn it around tonight and have a good win
6949354 he had advice for how he deals with struggles and the mental side
6949355 they werent going after bad pitches and were hitting strikes this is a good lineup
6949356 i couldnt keep the ball in the park you have to keep the ball in the ballpark no matter where you pitch when you give up five runs on two swings its hard to win like that
6949357 it was a two seamer that ran down and away and i just went with it and was able to get good wood on it
6949358 i knew what was going on i was falling behind in counts and not being aggressive
6949359 tonight i came out attacked the strike zone and got ahead
6949360 here lately his fastball has been up more and out of the strike zone but the good pitches that he made the ball sunk and he kept it low
6949361 paola has the beauty and sexuality necessary to portray my initial vision of night trips but updated to 2009 i started a trend back then giving a lot of companies creative ideas that have continued to this day in an industry that has left film behind in favor of video production i started shooting on film and will continue to shoot on film for years to come shooting film gives the images a one step removed quality that cant be duplicated in hd video remember that film is the original 100 year old high definition media
6949362 by joining dsr we hope to brand xxx racing fuels in the nhra and other racing venues as well
6949363 were extremely excited to join up with dsr and chip ellis we enjoy pro stock motorcycle racing chip ellis is a great rider and a good friend and were happy to support his and dsrs racing efforts
6949364 what we were looking for initially was consistency with fuel especially oxygenated fuels
6949365 with the way that fuels are typically oxygenated they lose their oxygenation content and other different factors as soon as the seal on the can is broken which causes inconsistencies with performance
6949366 the really great thing about it is that we burn all of the fuel so there are no residuals therefore the emissions are clean its essentially a horsepower producing green racing fuel
6949367 we are proud to welcome xxx racing fuels to don schumacher racing
6949368 we will work closely with them to help raise the awareness of their remarkable product within the nhra racing community
6949369 considering the dustiness of the track we made a very promising start on set up this morning we were able to go quicker on each run without changing too much and we took a very good baseline into the afternoon session in p2 our adjustments were again spot on but the sheer volume of traffic meant it was difficult to immediately confirm our final set up changes nonetheless we re in pretty good shape and i m looking forward to tomorrow
6949370 i immediately found a good balance at the front end and slowly dialled in the rear during the first session but the track was very green this morning which meant there was little point in making big changes to the car in the afternoon we made a number of changes which seemed to pay off for us by the end of the session the car was working well and the balance felt really good today s progress is very encouraging
6949371 it s always an interesting engineering challenge whenever you arrive at a new circuit and today in valencia was no exception we spent two very productive sessions concentrating on tyre choice while running appropriate fuel levels lewis and heikki also performed faultlessly allowing us to collect plenty of valuable data which we will go through tonight
6949372 a great circuit and a first class job by the organisers and especially bernie for the maiden race here in valencia for lewis and heikki and our team it was a good start to the weekend with fast and consistent lap times in race trim we stayed clear of the walls which is very important here you definitely should not lose valuable time on a new track because your car is in pieces and needs to be put together in the pits while your competitors are learning for qualifying and the race
6949373 its always enjoyable to come to a new venue and im impressed it was pretty hot out there but the track is good fun and the layout is interesting i like street circuits because i raced on so many of them during my time racing champ car in america but apart from the harbour and the buildings this doesnt really look like a street circuit because it has long straights we had a good day the first practice was a bit difficult and the track was very dusty but we expected that the afternoon was much better and the car got more and more into the set up window i hope we can keep going in this direction because it has been a productive day
6949374 that was not a particularly good day for me we need to adjust the car balance so we will have to look into it tonight the track is good though and i like it in karting we used to race on a lot of street circuits so learning it doesnt take long but you need to find a compromise on set up because there is a mix of slow corners and higher speed sections with long straights the most important thing is how much the surface will change during the weekend the asphalt is quite smooth and while it was predictably slippery today the grip should improve so it will be hard to get the set up right
6949375 the most important thing when you go to a new track is to make it through your programme without any technical problems which was the case today on the first day at a new track we amend our usual plan today we carried out more long runs both at the start of p1 to learn the circuit and at the end of p2 to help judge the tyre behaviour because we have no reference here apart from that you aim to find the balance and the right downforce levels there doesnt seem to be a lot of grip around and it didnt improve as massively as we would have expected still were quite happy with where we are with timo but jarno is struggling a bit with an inconsistent balance so we will have to look into that and fix it for tomorrow
6949376 valencia is a new street circuit in the middle of a city but the nice part is that its in the harbour its great when youve got boats and f1 cars together like that monaco gives us that kind of magic feeling and now its good to see valencia coming in
6949377 if you really break down what we actually do on the track indy should be just another race however because of the media attention and just so much more electricity the schedule gets just as busy as if it were a race going down to the wire it really is a bigger spectacle than anything that we do all year if i could pick one race that i havent won yet id even give up some of my race wins to win indy its just human nature to want to win the biggest event of the year so thats something thats in the back of my mind going into it this year i feel like my chances are as good if not better than they have ever been ive been fortunate to be in some good cars in my career and i just feel like this is as good of a chance as ive ever had
6949378 i think weve had an exceptional season if you take away the first four or five races with the exception of gainesville win we had a lot of first round losses early we were going through a little transition with the increase in the fuel percentage and it just took us awhile to get up and running but you take the last couple of months and weve probably accumulated as many points as anyone and wilkerson while we werent at our best he was racking up points and i think thats why you see the big points difference but weve made up a lot of ground in the last six or seven races i know the last few weve got a couple of wins and a couple of semifinal finishes the goal for us is really going to be to minimize those early round losses and i think thats going to be the key to success
6949379 the end result was we had to replace a chassis and roll a new body out but ive been in this business a long time and experienced the ups and downs what it really proved was that we were on the right track that we thought we were we just werent getting the results that we were expecting at that point it was just ironic that we had a wrecked car we were able to rebuild a new car and win the race really at that point mentally for myself dickie venables crew chief and our team that was pretty gratifying knowing that with all the work we were doing we were heading in the right direction sometimes you dont want to second guess yourself but i have to i have to constantly just to assure ourselves that we are preparing to really try and peak at the right time i think that kind of confirmed that we were
6949380 im only as good as the people i surround myself with and the companies that we are partnered up with
6949381 when you get into the playoffs thats when you really want to peak and im only as good as the companies that im involved with and not just from a financial standpoint some of the things weve tested we still havent seen the results on the technical side but were always looking at safety just being able to have access to the technology that gm has provided has been a great partnership every company is just so essential like gm quaker state snap on and the end result is we have the best equipment but weve got good talent too and ive built a relationship with the crew chief and i think one component that is very much underestimated is chemistry weve been able to maintain that and it takes work its quite an accomplishment for me to be able to go head to head with force and schumacher weve been able to beat them on a regular basis and our goal is to continue to do that but we certainly cant forget about wilkerson its going to be competitive but i do believe there are going to be some of those little details that make the difference and experience will be one of them were hoping to go into the countdown with a little advantage
6949382 without question i felt that this year should be better than last year we want the same result an nhra powerade championship and already were on pace with what we won last year and we havent even entered the countdown dickie has more experience and he continues to evolve and accumulate information i feel as comfortable and as confident as ever i really believe we should be able to win more races and overall my expectations were for us to finish the season a little bit better this year that means going back to those last couple of races vegas was great but i think going into pomona we left quite a bit on the table and still came away with the championship were not looking at one or two specific teams our goal is to qualify the best position we can be consistent and be solid on sunday all the other things they come to us thats something that can distract some other drivers with less experience ive just learned in my career that being steady works for me and thats my approach as a driver and thats dickies approach as a tuner
6949383 no i rarely look at statistics most of the time im reminded after they happen which is the way i prefer it its a lot of work but the getaway for me has become the getting in the car theres a lot of pressure there are a lot of responsibilities but i really enjoy working with my team and i enjoy working with our corporate partners it puts a smile on my face when i find out after some of those things id like to look back on at the end of my career but i dont feel like its time to do that yet i wake up in the morning and i try to figure out how im going to win today not looking back at how i did it how you did it then doesnt work for next week
6949384 were on track to being about as close to where we want to be heading into the countdown
6949385 i like the countdown i liked it last year but even if you give last year the same format that we have this year we still come away with the championship because those last six races we accumulated more points than anyone i still think we can do it a little bit better than we did last year we know that the competition is there but i feel as good as i ever have to win some more races
6949386 i think a lot of people can relate to the fact that i have a good relationship with my brother
6949387 unfortunately my dad passed away when i was 16 but because of that its been very very important for me to continue that legacy i have kids of my own so i want to stay safe and still entertain our audience we want them to buy in to what were doing weve also got a big hispanic following and thats very touching and very motivating to me thats why i wake up early and why i cant sleep very well because i feel like this is an important time of my career where i want to win races but i also want to be a good influence on those that follow the sport knows our background and follows our heritage its a great sport people forget when you peel away the layers of our competitiveness at the core of all of that is a big drag racing fan
6949388 he talked about people being blown to so many pieces that the cia would have to put them back together
6949389 i cant run if you cant hide and im allowed to change my mind if i want but everytime i make you cry there is a part of me inside that dies and now its time to begin to cross the brigdes that we burned in sin but if i find a way to erase turn the page on what weve left behind cause i cant breath when you r round with my sight
6949390 yang everything we do must achieve the intricate balance of things understand the excessiveness will bring about the opposite effects
6949391 do i seek to understand instead of only wanting to be understood
6949392 senator mccain if you are reading this then you are already dead unless of course you cant or dont breathe
6949393 a death threat is not a legitimate form of political expression
6949394 we wont stand for threats of this kind in colorado

6949396 with our brothers we will share all the secrets of our mountain all the riches buried there
6949397 tends toward the political and the controversial with a clear focus on crime and celebrity mixed in
6949398 if i were to watch the news that you hear in the united states id just blow my brains out
6949399 we will take this case as a lesson for our future news gathering and reporting
6949400 its the love you put in preparing dishes that your parents and grandparents made
6949401 its time for us to eat together and enjoy each other
6949402 mamie will call everybody on saturday and say tomorrows love feast
6949403 at bethel you can always get a good meal we just love to get together and feast
6949404 its about sharing a meal and the conversation that goes with that meal thats been a fact in the black church since the beginning
6949405 my parents said soul food came from back in slavery where everybody got together and it was just the bare necessities to stay alive
6949406 to me soul food is highly seasoned food no offense white folks dont season their food
6949407 soul food is food thats traditionally cooked by african americans

6949413 i was asked before beijing what my wish for these games was and i answered that it would be ireland going through the three weeks without being tainted by any hint of doping i am sick and tired of our name being dragged through the mud like this
6949414 we need to work every hour of every day now to restore confidence in the sport leaving it out of the olympics is not the answer
6949415 other sports have done it and now we need to i could understand how peoples confidence would be shaken
6949416 within three quarters of an hour of landing in hong kong word came through that there had been a positive test for an irish horse
6949417 we have no choice because testing is monitored by the individual bodies neither ourselves nor the irish sports council have any responsibility whatsoever for testing equestrian sports
6949418 the subject is so complex its beyond our expertise but we are now launching our own investigation into this case with horse sport ireland
6949419 we utterly refute the suggestion we didnt report it properly as we did

6949424 the lads who ensure that theres a conveyor belt of talent coming through theyre the unsung heroes who have done so much for irish boxing at the olympics
6949425 people need to stop saying that divine beings are pissed off when bad things happen because they obviously dont know what theyre talking about the gods are not immature children with more power than they can control and the gods are not malevolent for the most part they made us so that we could find happiness for ourselves not as squeeky toys that scream and bleed people seriously undersestimate the divine

6949428 witnesses have told us that the vehicle was travelling at high speeds just prior to the crash
6949429 we were looking for real simple things how they align to see how fundamentally sound we are in regards to blocking and tackling
6949430 its a good time for us to know who knows what they are doing it was a good time to evaluate guys
6949431 our team knows that its pretty clear that andrew is our quarterback and that position is pretty secure
6949432 i am hoping we make it we can we have a lot of potential
6949433 we just have to execute our blocks and get the run game going and then once we get that run game to where we want it you hit them with that pass and its deadly
6949434 the thing that happened too many times was that we put the ball on the ground
6949435 we had four or five instances where we turned the ball over we either threw an interception or put the ball on the ground those are the things that have been indicative of the past several years and those are things that we need to eliminate
6949436 if you ask the running backs what their greatest responsibility is they should say ball security thats because we preach that all the time
6949437 three fourths of all motorcycle accidents nationwide involve four wheel vehicles and two thirds of those are the fault of the four wheel driver
6949438 no the american newspaper isnt dead its just really re
6949439 undertakings given at the 2007 forum in tonga to hold an election by march 2009
6949440 for the first time this pacific islands forum has condemned directly the actions of bainimarama in failing to honour his undertakings to the pacific island leaders a year or so ago
6949441 secondly for the first time the leaders of the pacific islands forum have embraced the possibility of suspension of a member state to be adopted against fiji should they continue not to embrace their undertakings for march 2009 elections
6949442 he talked about people being blown to so many pieces that the cia would have to put them back together
6949443 being famous isnt really the goal its just like you know seeing what the world has to offer and sharing our talents with the people that enjoy music you know like true music fans
6949444 amps pedal boards an entire drum kit cymbals cables a bass amp t shirts cds you know everything that we carry around with us is just its gone
6949445 just constantly like raising money to like upgrade your gear and then for someone to just take it like that its just not fair
6949446 why are you that desperate that you would just come along and just anything on the street is just yours you know the world just isnt that way
6949447 that bill subversive sharp watch out for him misses nothing a dots connector
6949448 he felt really lonely and wanted to be with his mother and family
6949449 they dont really believe that the theater missile defense components in poland and in the czech republic although they are very small are in fact in the end really intended for iran
6949450 the other piece of this is that the russians have opposed the general national military defense program of the united states for a very long time
6949451 and they put the two things together they think this is the camels nose under the tent that the united states is putting in place in alaska now in central europe and who knows where next the components of an effective for a much more extensive ballistic missile defense system that would be directed against russian nuclear capabilities
6949452 the president traveled to georgia august 13 when there was a rally in tbilisi and stood beside georgian president mikhail saakashvili and said now we see the real face of russia
6949453 here is the president of poland clearly suggesting that russia is a serious military threat to all its neighbors that is obviously going to lead to the action that its has taken that is to defend itself as best it can
6949454 the russian military actions in georgia not only broke through whatever resistance the polish government had to doing the deal without getting further satisfaction on the terms of the deal but in addition pushed both sides to build in these extra defensive measures which are clearly directed against russia
6949455 no one raises any question but that the patriot missile battery or batteries that are to be put in poland plus the joint administration and patrolling of them by both u s and polish forces is designed for russia
6949456 if the russians should do anything to attack those missiles and american lives are at risk then that would mean that the debate about whether or not the united states would actually do something to protect members of nato would become academic
6949457 and indeed because american troops were there it would serve as a trigger and the united states would react
6949458 yes i think psychiatry is so interesting every patient is so different its so much more interesting than something like managing blood pressure medications
6949459 during the height of the cold war in the late 50s vogel was the only point man
6949460 there were many tense expeditions when we were in close proximity to soviet submarines and ships
6949461 being on a sub it was constantly impressed upon us who the enemy was there would be little posters reminding us to be quiet if you accidentally closed a hatch or door too hard that sound could actually emit out into the water and give your position away
6949462 for about two weeks we were in the north atlantic in a covert area and it was necessary to remain at periscope depth which is 50 feet underwater
6949463 it was hard to stay at that depth without breaking the surface and giving away our position it was extremely tense for those two weeks wed spend six hour watches in the control room just leaning over the steering mechanism with our eyes glued to the gauges as the sub bobbed up and down in the water another time we were discovered by the soviets and had to make a quick getaway
6949464 it was as close to the real thing as we could get
6949465 we had the missile launchers ready and we were all manned up we could go to war at a seconds notice not a minutes notice
6949466 while we were doing it we were using our radar to look into russia but of course we didnt tell them that
6949467 i said were not going out on deck we dont know if theyre shooting or what we checked every missile and it was the only time that ive ever seen the ready to load light steady on the monitor we sat there for a long time and eventually the captain came on and said what happened and to stand down
6949468 you lived under an air of suspicion and intrigue at the same time
6949469 being young soldiers you also had an air of cockiness about you and you felt invincible
6949470 but later i found out that this happened on a regular basis
6949471 you lived your normal life and did your job but you always looked over your shoulder wondering if you were being followed and you had to be careful what you said now as someone thats more stable in life i wonder how we lived through that but back then we loved what we were doing every soldier there was ready to do everything he could to preserve freedom
6949472 for the older georgians who remember the soviet domination i think theyre scared to death that its all going to come back
6949473 everything from communism to the social injustice and tyranny that marked that era it upsets me also because ive seen what its like for three years behind the wall and if you havent lived it you dont know what it is
6949474 regardless of who started the conflict between russia and georgia russia is taking their time to leave
6949475 if youve ever seen the dark shadow of old world communism before the wall fell its scary we had a saying when you went into east berlin you set your watch back 20 years they were that oppressed and a lot of them didnt even realize it
6949476 we had the opportunity to see how the other side lived and i actually enjoyed the experience i think it gives you a different outlook on life you dont take everything for granted and sometimes theres a price to be paid for things its a shame that we have to have it but when somebody threatens your lifestyle theres an opportunity to protect it
6949477 our main mission is the freedom of kashmir nothing else we are not spreading terrorism there is no movement of terrorism in kashmir it is a freedom struggle a simple freedom struggle freedom from indian occupation
6949478 that is the main thing business is suffering about 75 percent of it has gone tourism is zero now i do not know how long it will last but for two months we are suffering
6949479 the combat troops will withdraw from iraqi cities by june 2009
6949480 both the parties have agreed on this the negotiators job is done now it is up to the leaders
6949481 there are a lot of details that have to be worked out
6949482 it is worth what it has been worth since 1949 thats my short answer
6949483 terrorism radicalisation climate change energy these are the biggest security threats nowadays and they are not something nato can do much about it doesnt have an answer
6949484 for the last five years we have been increasingly focused on being an expeditionary force in afghanistan
6949485 now we have to struggle with the return of the classical nato challenge in georgia and were going to have to manage to do both
6949486 the era of russian weakness is over were now in a much more competitive relationship with russia and georgia has put european security back on the geopolitical map also for the us all that could mean a rejuvenation of nato
6949487 if we said no to the americans theres a danger the transatlantic alliance could unravel and the americans could leave europe we think that would be a disaster
6949488 but for the dutch or the portuguese nato is also about looking to the americans to keep the big european powers in check
6949489 russia misread that decision and saw it as a lack of resolve on natos part
6949490 moscow is well aware that few nato members want to extend a mutual security guarantee to a country at war with europes biggest neighbour
6949491 the main question is are you willing to go to war for tbilisi i think the answer is no

6949494 project danny involved the four fighter squadrons of marine aircraft group 51 mag 51 in the fall of 1944 to conduct an attack against the v 1 rocket launching sites in europe

6949509 anwar menipu kononnya telah berjumpa bapa altantuya di mongolia dan ketika itu saya telah mengetahui anwar akan datang ke situ dan bawa bapa altantuya dr shaariibuu setev ke rusia
6949510 tiada siapa pun yang lebih tahu selain daripada saya dan anwar telah berbohong dengan pelbagai tuduhan terhadap datuk seri najib
6949511 rakyat makin keliru kerana pembohongan semakin menjadi jadi dan saya rasa malu kerana nama pemimpin negara tak berkaitan dengan kes ini telah diburukkan oleh anwar dan raja petra
6949512 sangat sangat memalukan apabila nama pemimpin negara kita diburukkan di luar negara seolah olah terbabit dalam kes ini dan disebabkan itulah saya terpaksa menjelaskan kepada orang ramai mengenai pembohongan yang berlaku

6949520 i think its going to be very useful for consumers who want to reduce their risks especially for people who are infirm and people who are younger or older or predisposed by medical conditions they can consume this product and have the assurance that e coli and salmonella are destroyed
6949521 my guess is that theyre going to be using what we call an electrical beam generator so what happens is they actually generate electrons and focus those electrons on the particular product and those beams there will essentially destroy the organisms

6949557 despite the fact that more americans now have high tech entertainment equipment in our homes nothing beats seeing dark knight in a theater

6949710 the united states secret service has dispatched a protective detail to assume the immediate protection of sen joseph biden d del a source tells abc news indicating in all likelihood that biden has been officially notified that sen barack obama d illinois has selected him to be his running mate sources also tell abc news that two others said to be finalists for the position of obamas running mate sen evan bayh d ind and virginia gov tim kaine have been told they have not been selected for the vice presidential slot kaine flew to denver earlier today is in denver tonight and has no plans to leave in the next 24 hours bayh is at his washington dc home with his family biden was last seen minutes ago at his wilmington estate where his extended brood is gathering the obama campaign would not comment but obama mentioned biden twice in speeches on the trail this week both times heralding his legislative leadersip in east asia
6949711 i think a guy like myself a guy like matt holliday a guy like albert a guy like lance berkman each and every one of them would tell you if they set a goal to hit 370 380 or possibly make a run at 400 and sacrifice power in order to do so they could all make a good run at it
6949712 but we get paid to not only hit for average but to hit for power and drive in runs there are some instances where be damned a base hit we need to do some damage
6949713 when i was young i used to just depend on my mechanics and if my mechanics were sound it didnt matter to me who was on the mound
6949714 now im a lot more interested in details im less inclined to go up there and swing for the fences like i did when i was young
6949715 nothing wrong with hitting a ground ball up the middle for a base hit
6949716 to me it seems a little easier right for albert because of the fact theyre in a better position in the standings than we are right now
6949717 mentally it makes it easier for him than jones because the biggest thing is you go out and concentrate on what you have to do to help your ballclub if you focus on that it keeps you out of the mentality i have to get a hit
6949718 you really put the pressure on if you focus like that
6949719 i know the top three or four in our league are some of the best in the game
6949720 theres three guys there right around the 350 mark you get 500 600 plate appearances and youre able to reach base safely 35 percent of the time be on base 45 percent of the time i think thats doing your job and then some
6949721 hes still learning but you can tell him to go out there and run straight ahead because he looks like the sprinter from jamaica who just won all of that olympic gold

6949723 it was kind of awkward and weird at first im trying to get adjusted to it
6949724 i really want to be out there with my team
6949725 a lot of people dont like the preseason but for me especially right now its like building blocks of the foundation i need so that when the season starts i can be at my full potential
6949726 he was so anxious to get onto the field that he came out right away and was effective he played well even with the club on there
6949727 theres a lot of competition the way it should be it should bring out the best in everybody one guy brings something to the table another guys going to bring something else
6949728 but there are some other things i dont do too well and i definitely need to focus on that
6949729 get to the quarterback thats a big emphasis you dont want to be one dimensional i feel really confident and comfortable i just have to make it happen on sundays
6949730 its kind of claustrophobic your hand is like i want to get out
6949731 when i get my hand back its going to be wonderful
6949732 this is a big game as far as a significant amount of snaps they would get in a game
6949733 theyve played quite a bit more to this point than they have in previous preseasons
6949734 certainly youd like to be more productive when it comes to the offensive improvement with putting points on the board
6949735 were playing against another top 10 defense so the challenge is great
6949736 weve been trying real hard to develop our continuity in the offensive line both from a protection standpoint and a run standpoint because it all starts there
6949737 my focus ever since spring workouts is to find our best five guys and make sure theyre in a situation where they play well together
6949738 as a result of that a lot of things were doing now in practice and in preseason games is to make sure those guys are playing at the highest level they can play
6949739 ive got to learn about marc bulger and what gets him in a rhythm
6949740 and i havent done as good a job as id like to be able to do down the road to get him in a rhythm early in a game
6949741 we get to see a lot of the confusion and things like that that baltimore presents for you
6949742 to be really good youve got to continue to do that each week
6949743 he came in and learned the program so fast he was a shock this year nothing but getting better
6949744 going in there and playing in the gaps as an extra linebacker it was at first a difficult transition for me
6949745 it definitely had me sore getting knocked around by those linemen
6949746 i had a couple of the guys just joking with me messing with me talking about how they were going to pancake me every chance they get
6949747 he got a lot of good nickel work that first half which is something hes very capable of doing
6949748 and im pretty sure hell be playing there when i leave
6949749 last year when he came in he was so much of a rookie it was kind of hard to give anybody else any kind of advice
6949750 now he can lead some of these other kids that we have coming in hes done real well with that
6949751 hes going outside of just doing it because hes assigned to me
6949752 and actually just being a real friend to me and a real mentor so i appreciate it
6949753 anyhow if you want a target to shoot for it makes more sense to target instapundit than bass pundit
6949754 maybe if manu had played the whole game we would have lost by 10 or 15 points instead of 20
6949755 spain has to change many things and make a different way of game
6949756 this was the most important game of my life even more than the nba finals
6949757 the usa team combines technical ability physicality and discipline which they didnt show in previous tournaments
6949758 theyve got to play ugly if you try to play show time the way they play theyre going to get it
6949759 all youve got to do is play an unbelievable game and youve got a chance
6949760 we are not saying we got rid of all drugs no we would be a fool to say so but ill tell you what there not going stand on the corner and sale drugs while were here
6949761 people know what is going on a lot of these people out here know what is going on but they dont want to get out here and be seen by neighbors and friends fighting
6949762 get you a role model you are not ashamed of and it shouldnt be a drug dealer
6949763 you can take a horse to water but you cant make them drink
6949764 if that were to happen out of fear of protesters fear of unrest peru would someday remember it as the moment when change came to a halt and hundreds of thousands of people were condemned to poverty exclusion and marginalisation

6949767 well get him ready as soon as we can but as safe as we can hell start when hes ready
6949768 to give it a little more a little harder like getting ready for a game if everything goes well im sure theyd have me do something on tuesday or wednesday like maybe facing hitters ive got to get to 100 percent a couple of times before they make that call
6949769 once i get cleared to go and do it a couple of times i think im going to be fine i didnt not throw for that long a time
6949770 injuries slumps are a part of the game to a reasonable amount
6949771 when it gets unreasonable then you have to grind it out and gut it out its unfair but the games still count
6949772 but thats why were concerned about this weekend the braves are going to go about it like the braves always do
6949773 ankiel is still not ready to go 1 000 percent

6949776 rhee is trying to get rid of the veteran teachers rhee is trying to get rid of the black teachers i understand the anxiety
6949777 what i need is for you to have trust in me and in the school district
6949778 i know that trust doesnt come overnight and i have to earn that trust
6949779 my idea was to show dramatically the toll that the war was taking
6949780 i was kind of surprised they were being passed or even being considered
6949781 im trying to get more people from being killed and her the families of fallen soldiers are trying to prevent me strange
6949782 i thought they would know better than to pass laws that are unconstitutional
6949783 it generated sales and before too long we were sold out of shirts
6949784 weve continued to print them and update them weve now sold about 4 249
6949785 right after they passed the law here in arizona i got a phone call from someone who identified himself as a local police officer
6949786 he asked me if i was going to continue to sell these shirts and if i was aware of the new law
6949787 fraziers t shirts are themselves core political speech fully protected by the first amendment his website is like a street side table used to disseminate anti war and political messages
6949788 i cant overemphasize how grateful i am to the aclu for working with me on this because i couldnt have done this by myself
6949789 for years school officials have used detention remedial classes summer school and suspensions to turn around poorly behaved underachieving middle school students with little results now they are introducing a program that will pay students up to 100 per month for displaying good behavior
6949790 larger percentage of patients treated with vytorin were diagnosed with and died from all combined when compared to treatment with a placebo
6949791 the bottom line is that there is no evidence from this work the largest study published to date that the cholesterol lowering ability of statins increases the risk of cancer
6949792 lack an effect on cancer risk across all levels of on treatment
6949793 the so called j shaped curve has been seen repeatedly when cholesterol has been measured
6949794 in such studies persons with the lowest ldl cholesterol on entry show the highest death rate from cancer than those with higher
6949795 this is especially true of cancers involving the but it also occurs with cancer of the kidney and elsewhere
6949796 whatever the mechanism the main point should be that studies of much larger numbers of people in statin trials find no excess of cancers
6949797 you can measure the lengths of individual molecules and the average will be a pretty good description of any one
6949798 are all over the place theyre so diverse that its difficult to get one measurement that describes all of the possible structures
6949799 generated lots and lots of structures for both normal tau and a mutant form
6949800 there is no reason to think these face transplants would not be as common as kidney or liver transplants one day
6949801 to be able to wean down the dosage of the medication in small amounts and relatively quickly that is encouraging
6949802 when kidney transplants first began people were reluctant to donate because there were a lot of cultural social and religious issues
6949803 there are chemicals called bpas that are released from certain kinds of plastics and that mimic hormones your body produces what this means is that your body can be tricked into doing things it wouldnt normally do because it is responding to those imposter chemicals causing a host of potential growth problems down the road
6949804 we are not producing best performances at these games we need to find out why
6949805 we need to find out if this great investment in human and fiscal resources that weve put into some of these elite programs for a number of years is really paying off for us
6949806 and baton passes in the relay were not a part of that
6949807 the choices that have been made by those who have been responsible have got to be examined and theyve got to be questioned
6949808 the relays and the sprints are our signature events like it or not thats the way we are judged
6949809 we can win 35 medals in other events but if we dont do well in the sprints its something we feel extraordinarily bad about as fans as administrators as coaches as athletes
6949810 if it were just an inadvertent handoff a freaky kind of a thing youd understand youd feel bad about it as a fan and youd moan and groan but i have a feeling its a symptom of a larger systemic problem i have dug into it enough to have some reservations with regard to some of the things that im hearing
6949811 i was talking to carl lewis and carl was just bemoaning the fact that we didnt have a finalist in the long jump americas event its carl lewis its bob beamon its traditional
6949812 there are some good pockets on the field side we had a bright spot in the womens discus that was totally unanticipated a lot of what happened is simply sport i think that there are some telltales out there that certainly im going to charge this panel or task force or whatever you want to call it with looking into
6949813 in this view equates to the knowledge and experience which
6949814 manufacturer huawei model e220 etc to confirm i could tip to all three of them although the first is the one you will need to use
6949815 ill say yes to that idea but not because it is already running or anything im just saying yes because its possible i think it is possible sorry to say we dont have specific plans at the moment but it is possible yes
6949816 i knew a lot about bolton because one of my favourite players was okocha
6949817 when the manager came over to visit me in amsterdam i already had a very good feeling about it
6949818 i always watched bolton because of okocha who i think is the best dribbler ever
6949819 im play in a similar style and thats why the coach brought me here i like to excite the fans
6949820 to defend against lionel messi is the biggest thing we have to do
6949821 all i can say is yo jamaican sprinters are taking over the world
6949822 everyone who has come before me has done their duty so i have to make an extra effort

6949826 i believe that emmanuel has been unfairly treated because he had a lot of interest from many big clubs and he always told me one to one his preference was to stay in the end he stayed
6949827 that story did not come out like that in the press and unfortunately he is paying a price for a story which is not really him
6949828 he made a press conference in austria where people interpreted his statements a bit differently but i know what he told me and i know he made sacrifices to stay
6949829 i was convinced he wanted to stay but i was not always convinced he would stay because there is a big difference in that

6949886 for the first time in more than a decade a majority of americans believe churches and houses of worship should keep out of political matters
6949887 for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh but mighty before god to the throwing down of strongholds
6949888 but by the same token we know these very same people are not interested in less religiosity in the political discourse they almost universally want a religious person as president
6949889 its not that they want to take religion out of politics its that their frustrations with the way things seem to be going are leading them to say well maybe churches should back off on this
6949890 hi there my name is ron steen i am selling 2 of my future earnings for a chance to go to college
6949891 no one can serve two masters either he will hate the one and love the other or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other you cannot serve both god and money
6949892 i tremble for my country when i reflect that god is just that his justice cannot sleep forever
6949893 if we shall suppose that american slavery is one of those offenses which in the providence of god must needs come but which having continued through his appointed time he now wills to remove and that he gives to both north and south this terrible war as the woe due to those by whom the offense came shall we discern therein any departure from those divine attributes which the believers in a living god always ascribe to him
6949894 the judgments of the lord are true and righteous altogether
6949895 justice to roll down like waters in a mighty stream

6949899 i thought the key to the whole game was that we didnt get abreu out at all and he wont chase bad pitches
6949900 his velocity was about the same the second and third time around there were some pitches up
6949901 i like my game i like the way im playing
6949902 with a couple of exceptions today for not knowing the golf course i felt i did pretty well manoeuvring my ball around and to manoeuvre your ball around a golf course you dont know you have to have control i felt like i did that pretty well
6949903 itd be pretty tough i think but if you are playing well 64 65 seems possible
6949904 i kept looking at the mountains over there and it kept me really relaxed
6949905 people most in need of a clear and explicit warning regarding ssl certificates are inexperienced users and those are not very likely to understand the error message that firefox 3 is displaying a large portion will simply be scared away thinking that the web site is broken
6949906 mozilla firefox 3 limits usable encrypted ssl web sites to those who are willing to pay money to one of their approved digital certificate vendors this policy is bad for the web
6949907 used to be the stuff of scary security fiction but now they are point and click
6949908 the only thing that will tell you whether the sites you are visiting are real is the existence of a trusted certificate which only the legitimate site can have
6949909 theyve been getting good pitching all year and theyre hitting the ball now so i think theyre a lot better than their record

6949920 well have one last good faith attempt in terms of a private meeting between the prime minister and opposition leaders
6949921 is trying to save face trying to find an excuse to once again break his word this time on the fixed election date law
6949922 the official excuse that parliament is not functioning is phony
6949923 what is true is that the prime minister does not want people to realize he has ethical problems in his government and to what extent he has badly prepared us as a country for the economic slowdown we face
6949924 if he pulls the plug on the parliament without even having the members of the house come back to their seats and show what they can do then hes showing contempt for the democratic institutions and for the fact that canadians did not elect him to a majority government only to a minority
6949925 this is the sort of thing that they usually trot out at election time
6949926 can you imagine if russia decided to close down cnn

6949928 looking back it seems like i was never in a pitchers count where i was ahead of them these are tough guys to pitch behind it wasnt one of those days where i commanded the ball well
6949929 id rather them swing and hit the ball than give them a free one like that

6949955 when i saw the pictures in the papers i was absolutely baffled
6949956 i thought surely no member of the public is going to believe that a board game could be used as a weapon
6949957 could be used to conceal someones identity or could be used in the course of a criminal act
6949958 a beard can conceal someones identity are the police going to start banning beards
6949959 when we watched the news there was this endless sense of frustration and disbelief that despite the mass marches and protests we were off to war
6949960 we thought it was a ridiculous process that needed to be ridiculed
6949961 the manager of the local borders bookshop in cambridge thought it was a great idea and wanted to trial it
6949962 a day before it was due to appear head office said not to stock it that happened time and time again
6949963 we dont censor our products the game just wasnt selling
6949964 the idea is to encourage the sort of short term selfish thinking that led us into war
