8010000 no i dont love her i never even kiss her
8010001 im not something in me shrinks from her like so good when im not good
8010002 i do i know she wants a sort of soul union
8010003 and you havent found out the very first thing about her
8010004 that she doesnt want any of your soul communion thats your own imagination she wants you
8010005 sir thomas more says one can marry at twenty four
8010006 not now because weve no money and they depend on me at home
8010007 you wouldnt be ashamed before your god why are you before people
8010008 and its my fault but you know i cant help being as i you
8010009 i love you an awful lot then there is something short
8010010 oh in me it is i who ought to be ashamed like a spiritual cripple and i am ashamed it is misery why is it
8010011 dont you think we have been too fierce in our what they call purity dont you think that to be so much afraid and averse is a sort of dirtiness
8010012 you recoiled away from anything of the sort and i took the motion from you and recoiled also perhaps worse
8010013 all these years of intimacy i feel naked enough before you do you understand
8010014 i was thinking all the while i love you i have been obstinate
8010015 i am glad i came back to you i feel so simple with you as if there was nothing to hide we will be happy
8010016 makes us not want get away from the very thing we want we have to fight against that
8010017 but theres not much risk for you really not in the gretchen way you can trust me there
8010018 nearly it is like being on a ship up here
8010019 the fir trees are like presences on the darkness each one only a presence
8010020 a sort of hush the whole night wondering and asleep i suppose thats what we do in death sleep in wonder
8010021 to be rid of our individuality which is our will which is our effort to live effortless a kind of curious sleep that is very beautiful i think that is our after life our immortality
8010022 and the water singing to itself as it runs do you love it
8010023 but all my life mother said to me there is one thing in marriage that is always dreadful but you have to bear it and i believed it
8010024 i believe as you do that loving even in that way is the high water mark of living
8010025 that doesnt alter the fact that you never want it
8010026 shall we be married then i want you to have my children
8010027 i dont know i suppose i did all the jawing i usually do i think i was telling her about the strike and how the women took it
8010028 on tuesday in the work room you know ive got a corner where i can work often i can do every single thing they need in the department before dinner then i work for myself in the afternoon and just see to things at night
8010029 i dont love her i dont want to marry her so i shall have done
8010030 i thought lately you had made up your mind to have her and so i said nothing
8010031 i had i wanted to but now i dont want its no good i shall break off on sunday i ought to oughtnt i
8010032 you know best you know i said so long ago
8010033 i cant help that now i shall break off on sunday
8010034 i think it will be best but lately i decided you had made up your mind to have her so i said nothing and should have said nothing but i say as i have always said i dont think she is suited to you
8010035 you will be so much better when it is all over
8010036 it isnt i dont want to marry i dont want ever to marry and if were not going to marry its no good going on
8010037 and what about these last months and the things you told me then
8010038 i cant help it i dont want to go on
8010039 i want us to break off you be free of me i free of you
8010040 i dont know ive not told you anything but what i thought was true
8010041 im the same only i know its no good going on
8010042 because i dont want to go on and i dont want to marry
8010043 how many times have you offered to marry me and i wouldnt
8010044 i have said you were only fourteen you are only four
8010045 all right if im a child of four what do you want me for i dont want another mother
8010046 why i want us to separate we have lived on each other all these years now let us stop i will go my own way without you and you will go your way without me you will have an independent life of your own then
8010047 we shall always be more or less each others work you have done a lot for me i for you now let us start and live by ourselves
8010048 tell them you wouldnt and wont marry me and have broken off
8010049 it has been one long battle between us you fighting away from me
8010050 but weve had some perfect hours some perfect times when we were together
8010051 it has been good but it is at an end
8010052 then you could do as you liked with him plenty of men will worship you if you get on the private side of their natures you ought to marry one such they would never fight you off
8010053 but dont advise me to marry someone else any more youve done it before
8010054 oh very well if she knew then it doesnt come as a surprise to her
8010055 do you remember the things you said this time last year in my grandmothers house nay last month even
8010056 i do and i meant them i cant help that its failed
8010057 it would have failed whether or not you never believed in me
8010058 were not strangers never should be whatever happened i will write to you now and again you please yourself
8010059 give me a hard one nut i dont like creams
8010060 we thought you looked overcast and they dared me offer you a chocolate
8010061 its hard for her now but best in the long run i know you werent suited for her
8010062 ive had such a lark with some girls in a pub
8010063 she never thought shed have me mother not from the first and so shes not disappointed
8010064 you shall see my pigeon you see if youre not swanky one of these days
8010065 but youll have to alter look at you with minnie
8010066 i heard her this morning eh mrs morel i was going to do that when you went out in the rain for some coal
8010067 that looks a lot like your being able to manage servants
8010068 and you apologising to her you cant do two things at once can you
8010069 i think it suits you youve got a new frock on
8010070 no i had made up my mind i told her quite definitely i should consider myself free
8010071 you will meet me at the fountain at two oclock
8010072 do you feel like a blot of vermilion walking down the street
8010073 because i didnt want to go on with her and i didnt want to marry
8010074 you didnt want to marry miriam or you didnt want to marry at all
8010075 miriam she said i was a baby of four and that i always had battled her off
8010076 but you have really been going with her for some time
8010077 yes i ought to have dropped it years back but it would have been no good going on two wrongs dont make a right
8010078 i shall be thirty one or am i thirty one
8010079 you press the vein in my arm holding it so tightly
8010080 it has scarcely altered since little kirke white used to come
8010081 all right you see i cant help you i should only hinder give me that little parcel and your gloves your poor shoes
8010082 but theres a rut where a man has been so if we go on i guess we shall find the path again
8010083 and now ill clean thy boots and make thee fit for respectable folk
8010084 im your boot boy for the time being and nothing else
8010085 i tell you nothing gets done when theres a woman about
8010086 arent i a great hand at restoring you to respectability stand up there you look as irreproachable as britannia herself
8010087 i could wish youd had something of a better day
8010088 i dont know whether youd like some radishes as well
8010089 but ive got some in the garden and a cucumber
8010090 well she doesnt know and it shows were nice in ourselves at any rate you look quite enough to satisfy an archangel and im sure i feel harmless so if it makes you look nice and makes folk happy when they have us and makes us happy why were not cheating them out of much
8010091 ah but i shall ask her to give me one
8010092 but you seem to feel you have done a wrong
8010093 if they knew theyd cease to understand as it is they do understand and they like it what do they matter here with only the trees and me you dont feel not the least bit wrong do you
8010094 i believe eve enjoyed it when she went cowering out of paradise
8010095 why they know shes a suffragette and so on and what if they do talk
8010096 but you know what folks are and if once she gets talked about
8010097 well i cant help it their jaw isnt so almighty important after all
8010098 so i do what can people say that we take a walk together i believe youre jealous
8010099 you know i should be glad if she werent a married woman
8010100 well my dear she lives separate from her husband and talks on platforms so shes already singled out from the sheep and as far as i can see hasnt much to lose no her lifes nothing to her so whats the worth of nothing she goes with me it becomes something then she must pay we both must pay folk are so frightened of paying theyd rather starve and die
8010101 very well my son well see how it will end
8010102 and awfully nice mother she is really you dont know
8010103 but shes nice mother she is and not a bit common
8010104 but you seem to think as good better than ninety nine folk out of a hundred i tell you shes better she is shes fair shes honest shes straight there isnt anything underhand or superior about her dont be mean about her
8010105 yes yes if youd anything about you youd be glad do you want to see her
8010106 then i will bring her here one sunday to tea if you think a horrid thing about her i shant forgive you
8010107 oh but it feels so fine when shes there shes such a queen in her way
8010108 i oh not much i made a sketch of bestwood from the garden that is nearly right at last its the hundredth try
8010109 yes i went up clifton grove on monday afternoon with clara
8010110 but i wanted to go out and it was all right the trent is full
8010111 it was the jolliest old woman she gave us several pompom dahlias as pretty as you like
8010112 because she liked us because we were jolly i should think
8010113 by the way what of her husband one never hears anything of him
8010114 hes got some other woman and is also quite all right
8010115 i see you dont know for certain dont you think a position like that is hard on a woman
8010116 how can she and if she does look at her position
8010117 no i dont but if a womans got nothing but her fair fame to feed on why its thin tack and a donkey would die of it
8010118 she never knew the fearful importance of marriage she thought it was all in the days march it would have to come and dawes well a good many women would have given their souls to get him so why not him then she developed into the femme incomprise and treated him badly ill bet my boots
8010119 i suppose so i suppose she had to it isnt altogether a question of understanding its a question of living with him she was only half alive the rest was dormant deadened and the dormant woman was the femme incomprise and she had to be awakened
8010120 i dont know i rather think he loves her as much as he can but hes a fool
8010121 yes but my mother i believe got real joy and satisfaction out of my father at first i believe she had a passion for him thats why she stayed with him after all they were bound to each other
8010122 and with my father at first im sure she had the real thing she knows she has been there you can feet it about her and about him and about hundreds of people you meet every day and once it has happened to you you can go on with anything and ripen
8010123 its so hard to say but the something big and intense that changes you when you really come together with somebody else it almost seems to fertilise your soul and make it that you can go on and mature
8010124 and you think your mother had it with your father
8010125 yes and at the bottom she feels grateful to him for giving it her even now though they are miles apart
8010126 and i wondered when i was in the train whatever i should do if you werent there
8010127 you ought to object to my getting them because of the birds but they dont care much for rose hips in this part where they can get plenty of stuff you often find the berries going rotten in the springtime
8010128 what a pity there is a coal pit here where it is so pretty
8010129 you see i am so used to it i should miss it no and i like the pits here and there i like the rows of trucks and the headstocks and the steam in the daytime and the lights at night when i was a boy i always thought a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night was a pit with its steam and its lights and the burning bank and i thought the lord was always at the pit top
8010130 i was pleased when he said he would bring you
8010131 when i was a girl girl i say when i was a young woman we lived in minerva terrace
8010132 i am very glad to see you i am i assure you but dont disturb yourself no no make yourself quite comfortable and be very welcome
8010133 from nottingham then you have had a beautiful day for your journey
8010134 eh there are so few it will only take a minute
8010135 yes i went to agathas to tea we are going to chapel i only called in for a moment to see clara
8010136 i dont think youve seen all the sorts come and look come and see which are your favourites clara
8010137 look miriam these are the white ones that came from your garden they arent so fine here are they
8010138 but theyre hardier youre so sheltered things grow big and tender and then die these little yellow ones i like will you have some
8010139 mother asked me to say shed be pleased to see you any time if you cared to come
8010140 thank you i should like to but i cant say when
8010141 only talk there never was a great deal more than talk between us
8010142 no or i might have married her but its all up really
8010143 if i was with her now we should be jawing about the christian mystery or some such tack thank god im not
8010144 i dont give her up because theres nothing to give
8010145 i dont know why she and i shouldnt be friends as long as we live
8010146 i tell you its only words that go between us
8010147 and can i get from here to the station in fourteen minutes
8010148 but you could easily walk it clara its only seven miles to the tram ill come with you
8010149 well i must say your boots are in a nice state
8010150 i hope her feet werent so filthy where on earth you dragged her i dont know
8010151 yes i liked her but youll tire of her my son you know you will
8010152 youll go and knock yourself up youd better drink hot milk
8010153 yes and put on an evening suit will you ive never seen you in it
8010154 but good lord clara think of me in evening suit at the theatre
8010155 i will if you want me to but i sll feel a fool
8010156 then feel a fool for my sake once wont you
8010157 come home for the night i can sleep with mother
8010158 its mr morel he has missed his train i thought we might put him up for the night and save him a ten mile walk
8010159 thats your lookout if youve invited him hes very welcome as far as im concerned you keep the house
8010160 nay nay you neednt come along in i dunno what youll think of the supper id got her
8010161 oh dont you be apologetic it doesnt do wi me you treated her to the theatre didnt you
8010162 well and whats an inch of bacon take your coat off
8010163 but you twos a pair of bright beauties i must say whats all that get up for
8010164 there isnt room in this house for two such bobby dazzlers if you fly your kites that high
8010165 what should i like to see her make a fool of herself for
8010166 i believe youre jealous that you cant swank as well
8010167 me i could have worn evening dress with anybody if id wanted to
8010168 no i didnt and when i was in service i knew as soon as one of the maids came out in bare shoulders what sort she was going to her sixpenny hop
8010169 were you too good to go to a sixpenny hop
8010170 youd never think it she made me want to howl even now
8010171 i should like to see myself howling at that bad old baggage
8010172 its time she began to think herself a grandmother not a shrieking catamaran
8010173 my mother does sometimes and its no good my telling her
8010174 shed like to and she says she will so i give her a little stool to stand on
8010175 but she often cant touch that lady with a long prop
8010176 i sd think she doesnt want touching with a prop
8010177 it might do the pair of you good to give you a crack on the head with one
8010178 but it takes hours to settle down to sleep after the theatre
8010179 well ill teach you again may we play crib mrs radford
8010180 isnt it nigh on time you two was thinking o bed
8010181 oh very well then if its not late enough stop a bit longer only you neednt come waking me up when ive got to sleep

8010190 but im going to bust this four pounds should we go to the seaside for a day or two
8010191 you wouldnt be long in breaking your neck at a hurdle race
8010192 so long as i get a good run for my money will you
8010193 is really a military institution take germany now shes got thousands of aristocrats whose only means of existence is the army theyre deadly poor and lifes deadly slow so they hope for a war they look for war as a chance of getting on till theres a war they are idle good for nothings when theres a war they are leaders and commanders there you are then they want war
8010194 did you learn all that at th theatre th other night
8010195 oh him in a bob tailed evening suit on the lardy da
8010196 its no good you might just as well own up
8010197 own up what that i happened to take a friend to the theatre
8010198 oh well if it was all right tell us who she was lad
8010199 paul boy im surprised at you and do you know her baxter
8010200 you dont get off as easy as that my lad weve got to have a full account of this business

8010203 hes a loud mouthed one he is and theyre never much good give me a pleasant spoken chap if you want a devil

8010206 half a minute old man you an mes going the same road i believe
8010207 youll see we shant have him in much more im sorry hes good company and baxter dawes wants locking up thats what he wants
8010208 you can fight him if you have to i suppose
8010209 no i havent the least sense of the fist its funny with most men theres the instinct to clench the fist and hit its not so with me i should want a knife or a pistol or something to fight with
8010210 but hell do something to you you dont know him
8010211 but why are you so silly you dont know him
8010212 yes but youre not going to let a man do as he likes with you
8010213 let a man like him do as he likes with you
8010214 but if i did see what a hold hed have over me
8010215 not at all but you dont understand me my dear
8010216 the man in righteousness arrayed the pure and blameless liver needs not the keen toledo blade nor venom freighted quiver
8010217 youre goin to answer for that job of the other night
8010218 but wait till i light on you no matter where it is ill settle your hash for a bit yer little swine
8010219 ill come down directly ive got a visitor just now
8010220 ill visitor you inside of two minutes think im goin to have you whipperty snappin round
8010221 fanny says you could have had it last night if youd let her know
8010222 get off about your business and dont come here tipsy in the morning
8010223 now you get off and dont be long about it comin here with your rowdying
8010224 dawes took occasion to insult mrs dawes and me because i accompanied her to the theatre one evening then i threw some beer at him and he wanted his revenge
8010225 what do you think i took the case up for
8010226 better speak it openly than leave it to be whispered
8010227 they do in a way one doesnt like as a rule
8010228 youll find youre not as good at putting up as you imagine
8010229 i dont care what her opinion of me is shes fearfully in love with me but its not very deep
8010230 you know mother i think there must be something the matter with me that i cant love when shes there as a rule i do love her sometimes when i see her just as the woman i love her mother but then when she talks and criticises i often dont listen to her
8010231 perhaps and i love her better than miriam but why dont they hold me
8010232 no at first perhaps i would but why why dont i want to marry her or anybody i feel sometimes as if i wronged my women mother
8010233 but no mother i even love clara and i did miriam but to give myself to them in marriage i couldnt i couldnt belong to them they seem to want me and i cant ever give it them
8010234 and i never shall meet the right woman while you live
8010235 i shall have to get some steady designing work and some sort of sale for my pictures first
8010236 i am gradually making my way i know i am
8010237 i dont know i shall hardly go for long while theres my mother
8010238 and if you made a nice lot of money what would you do
8010239 go somewhere in a pretty house near london with my mother
8010240 i dont know dont ask me what i should do i dont know
8010241 i dont know anything be with me now will you no matter what it is
8010242 but what do you always want to be kissing and embracing for
8010243 always even if i come to ask you about the work
8010244 and youll regulate it according to mr jordans closing time
8010245 yes and according to the freedom from business of any sort
8010246 thats all and not always then not the kissing sort of love
8010247 not much more than a big white pebble on the beach not much more than a clot of foam being blown and rolled over the sand
8010248 shes lost like a grain of sand in the beach just a concentrated speck blown along a tiny white foam bubble almost nothing among the morning why does she absorb me
8010249 heres the seacoast morning big and permanent and beautiful there is she fretting always unsatisfied and temporary as a bubble of foam what does she mean to me after all she represents something like a bubble of foam represents the sea but what is she its not her i care for
8010250 but she is magnificent and even bigger than the morning and the sea
8010251 go with your mother to sutton i am so dull
8010252 why even now when we are on this short holiday
8010253 i dont know love making stifles me in the daytime
8010254 but you dont really want a divorce from baxter do you
8010255 you consider your own affairs and dont know so much about other peoples
8010256 i suppose you thought he was a lily of the valley and so you put him in an appropriate pot and tended him according you made up your mind he was a lily of the valley and it was no good his being a cow parsnip you wouldnt have it
8010257 i certainly never imagined him a lily of the valley
8010258 you imagined him something he wasnt thats just what a woman is she thinks she knows whats good for a man and shes going to see he gets it and no matter if hes starving he may sit and whistle for what he needs while shes got him and is giving him whats good for him
8010259 you think i want to give you whats good for you
8010260 i hope so but love should give a sense of freedom not of prison miriam made me feel tied up like a donkey to a stake i must feed on her patch and nowhere else its sickening
8010261 and would you let a woman do as she likes
8010262 yes ill see that she likes to love me if she i dont hold her
8010263 but we walk side by side and yet im in london arguing with an imaginary orpen and where are you
8010264 about the cruelty of women i wish you knew the cruelty of men in their brute force they simply dont know that the woman exists
8010265 did you know baxter as well as you know me
8010266 its what men wont let you do they wont let you get really near to them
8010267 but youve never come near to me you cant come out of yourself you cant baxter could do that better than you
8010268 you begin to value baxter now youve not got him
8010269 no i can only see where he was different from you
8010270 do you think its worth it the the sex part
8010271 its the culmination of everything all our intimacy culminates then
8010272 as if i hadnt got you as if all of you werent there and as if it werent me you were taking
8010273 something just for yourself it has been fine so that i darent think of it but is it me you want or is it it
8010274 when i had baxter actually had him then i did feel as if i had all of him
8010275 yes yes it was more whole i dont say you havent given me more than he ever gave me
8010276 its something and sometimes you have carried me away right away i know and i reverence you for it but
8010277 i dont know my shoulder say it was a bicycle accident mother
8010278 your mothers nearly frightened me out of my wits fainted away
8010279 im sure you must be hungry and theyve kept dinner waiting
8010280 only a bit of a tumour my boy you neednt trouble its been there the lump has a long time
8010281 here but you know they can sweal a tumour away
8010282 yes but not more than ive often had at home i believe dr ansell is an alarmist

8010348 he did at any rate he did respect me and thats what you dont do
8010349 he did and i made him horrid i know i did youve taught me that and he loved me a thousand times better than ever you do
8010350 i try to think of the nice times when we went to mablethorpe and robin hoods bay and shanklin
8010351 after all not everybody has seen those beautiful places and wasnt it beautiful i try to think of that not of the other things
8010352 no shall we go to the seaside for the week end
8010353 there are different ways of dying my fathers people are frightened and have to be hauled out of life into death like cattle into a slaughter house pulled by the neck but my mothers people are pushed from behind inch by inch they are stubborn people and wont die
8010354 and she wont die she cant mr renshaw the parson was in the other day think he said to her you will have your mother and father and your sisters and your son in the other land and she said i have done without them for a long time and can do without them now it is the living i want not the dead she wants to live even now
8010355 and she looks at me and she wants to stay with me
8010356 shes got such a will it seems as if she would never go never
8010357 and she was religious she is religious now but it is no good
8010358 and she knows it when i ask her shall you have anything shes almost afraid to say yes ill have a cup of bengers she says itll only keep your strength up i said to her yes and she almost cried but theres such a gnawing when i eat nothing i cant bear it so i went and made her the food its the cancer that gnaws like that at her i wish shed die

8010362 that night on woodborough road when you and her passed me you with your hand on her shoulder
8010363 i never knew you were there till the very second when you passed
8010364 never mind my love ill stop with you half an hour my pigeon then perhaps it will be better
8010365 the doctor says she cant last but i know she will shell be here at christmas
8010366 cant you give her something to put an end to it
8010367 i cant bear it much longer we shall all go mad
8010368 go and sit with her while we have breakfast minnie
8010369 have the men been saying their hands are sore minnie
8010370 but at any rate therell be something to buy in with this week
8010371 its a new sleeping draught the doctor gave me for you
8010372 he thought it would leave you in such a state in the morning
8010373 and i told her it was a new draught wheres that milk
8010374 i wonder why nurse didnt come to settle me down
8010375 she said she was going to a concert my love
8010376 i didnt think you could do the bed so nicely
8010377 all right and call me if you see any difference

8010384 starting again i feel in a lot bigger mess than you
8010385 i dont know i dont know its as if i was in a tangled sort of hole rather dark and dreary and no road anywhere
8010386 you dont look as if much life had gone out of you
8010387 weve both got plenty of life in us yet to make things fly
8010388 yes she never really hitched on to me you were always there in the background thats why she wouldnt get a divorce
8010389 they want me like mad but they dont want to belong to me and she belonged to you all the time i knew
8010390 they look all right but theres some water in em yet
8010391 youre not much of a man with water in your legs

8010397 didnt i hear something about your earning your own living
8010398 im merely going to the farming college at broughton for three months and i shall probably be kept on as a teacher there
8010399 i say that sounds all right for you you always wanted to be independent
8010400 oh i dont think it wont be a great deal only youll find earning your own living isnt everything
8010401 i suppose work can be nearly everything to a man
8010402 though it isnt to me but a woman only works with a part of herself the real and vital part is covered up
8010403 how you waste yourself you might be ill you might die and i never know be no more then than if i had never known you
8010404 at any rate i could prevent you wasting yourself and being a prey to other women like like clara
8010405 i know you do but you love me so much you want to put me in your pocket and i should die there smothered
8010406 i dont know go on i suppose perhaps i shall soon go abroad
8010407 stop all this restlessness and beating against death you are mine for a mate
8010408 stop in the name of love before you break my heart

8010418 her situation remains unresolved after an interminable process which includes a colleague questioning her competence and finally a referral to the general medical council she could remain on full pay and unable to work for at least another year
8010419 there is no doubt that arrangements for the management of private practice and for the collection of income have been much strengthened as a result

8010423 oh grandfather frog tell us why you dont have a tail as you did when you were young
8010424 the frogs ruled the world which was mostly water there was very little dry land oh very little in deed there were no boys to throw stones and no hungry mink to gobble up foolish frog babies who were taking a sun bath
8010425 in those days all the frogs had tails long hand some tails of which they were very very proud in deed
8010426 the king of all the frogs was twice as big as any other frog and his tail was three times as long
8010427 now all the other frogs did just as the king did so pretty soon none of the frogs were doing any thing but sitting about eating sleeping and admiring their own tails and the kings
8010428 now you all know that people who do nothing worthwhile in this world are of no use and there is little room for them so when mother nature saw how useless had become the frog tribe she called the king frog before her and she said
8010429 because you can think of nothing but your beautiful tail it shall be taken away from you
8010430 the king frog looked at his beautiful tail and already it seemed to have grown shorter he looked again and it was shorter still every time he looked his tail had grown shorter and smaller by and by when he looked there was nothing left but a little stub which he couldnt even wriggle then even that disappeared his eyes popped out of his head and his mouth grew bigger and bigger
8010431 and from that day to this every frog has started life with a big tail and as he has grown bigger and bigger his tail has grown smaller and smaller until finally it disappears and then he remembers how foolish and useless it is to be vain of what nature has given us and that is how i came to lose my tail
8010432 i guess i must wait until he falls sound asleep again
8010433 there were three former staff members who were listed on the search warrant that was served on me in early july and we facilitated the gathering of material for police
8010434 the college received some internet material which contained allegations that i think are linked to the ones that are currently taking place
8010435 those matters were referred to the police some years ago
8010436 those circumstances where people have betrayed trust it is a matter of grave concern and shame and it needs to be addressed comprehensively in order to protect children in the future
8010437 i can assure parents that this school is committed to the most thorough child protection measures that we have been implementing for some considerable period of time
8010438 we work closely with authorities in the area of child protection we are committed to protecting children wherever we can
8010439 weve had five people come forward that formed part of the initial investigation
8010440 and as a consequence to those five people coming forward weve identified another eight people so at this stage were speaking to 13 people
8010441 what we can say at this stage is that there is a number of lines of inquiry that have come from the initial inquiries
8010442 there are a number of inquiries continuing and there are some suspects involved
8010443 will you succeed yes you will indeed 98 3 4 guaranteed

8010460 any gymnastics is classified as a level two medium risk which is a danger to the children
8010461 what they dont tell you is soccer football tennis most of those are level two or three which is extreme or high risk and those sports are still allowed to be played at lunchtime
8010462 i thought it was a bit unfair because we always do these kind of things at school
8010463 when i arrived in the operations room i saw a book of idf safety instructions that shouldnt have been there
8010464 there were idf cds that explicitly said confidential documenting army activities charts from special units operations and officers names
8010465 the training companies wanted to finish the projects as quickly as possible in order to create more projects and make more money
8010466 we knew the training had to be completed quickly because the soldiers would soon have to get into real military activity
8010467 by israeli standards the soldiers had almost zero capability and the officers were mediocre
8010468 it was clear that taking that army to war was illogical
8010469 some of them became good friends of mine and invited me into their homes its hard to digest that these people have suddenly vanished from the face of the earth
8010470 all of the companys actions were approved by the defense ministry including the materials transferred to the training companies the information security standards were set emphasized and maintained by experienced security officers and we have no knowledge of these claims
8010471 we have detained 10 agents of the georgian special services who were spying on military facilities and preparing terrorist attacks including on russian territory
8010472 im not afraid of tomorrow for i have lived yesterday and love today
8010473 i have handled many investigations but i cant recall a single other investigation that turned all of our stomachs in which investigators came out of briefings with tears in their eyes
8010474 ronny and marie are involved in the murder and disappearance of rose
8010475 she did something which angered ronny and he struck her on the head
8010476 she slumped her head and ronny thought she was angry at him for hitting her he then realised that the blow had killed her and he panicked he was terrified by the prospect of facing his partner marie so he drove to the yarkon river placed the girls body in a suitcase and dumped it into the water
8010477 we have conducted an extensive search in different places including the yarkon river where for several days we applied different means to locate the body
8010478 we are doing this because we believe there is a lot of untapped information here in afghanistan
8010479 we are using the rewards for justice programme to facilitate the finding the whereabouts of these people but also the leadership of these kind of organisations
8010480 the united states economy has a total weather sensitivity of roughly 2 5 trillion 23 percent of the national economy
8010481 in contrast bolivia has a total weather sensitivity of just over 2 billion thats 31 percent of the bolivian economy
8010482 these farmers have corn on the ground and are not covered for a frost event for the rest of the season and some might have corn through late october
8010483 were seeing a lot of corn farmers buying coverage from us for frost from illinois iowa and
8010484 made millions of dollars hedging hundreds of millions of dollars in risk
8010485 means that a dollar in brazil will be thirty times more weather sensitive than a dollar in pakistan
8010486 were primarily a technology company and weve built a platform that allows us to write any sort of weather contract for any sort of business to protect against their specific risks
8010487 were really trying to bring these products to the masses

8010496 we wish we could have got a deal done but the asking price was way off the charts i have good faith in both bale and rosa to assume the last spot in the rotation and feel it is unnecessary to go out and get a pricey free agent
8010497 every morning and then grabs a venti double shot latte no foam on her way such are the mysteries that are rattling around in my brain at six thirty in the freakin morning
8010498 wonder why that hot looking couple always walks the wrong way
8010499 i dont know im thinking its a possum or a raccoon im pretty sure its not a skunk because weve had a dead skunk under our house before
8010500 well a dead skunk doesnt always smell like a skunk

8010503 our staff has been diligent and aggressive about protecting consumer rights
8010504 we encourage consumers to let us know when there is a problem they cant resolve with their insurance company well review all the documents and help guide consumers through tough insurance questions
8010505 often our role is to explain insurance law or help decipher a policy question for consumers
8010506 while our process may not always result in a restoration of benefits or a refund to the consumer we work to educate consumers so they make informed decisions in the future

8010510 thats no surprise because virtualization has had a huge impact on the way enterprises do disaster recovery
8010511 virtualization makes some aspects of backup and disaster recovery more difficult
8010512 it shops are still struggling with the steep learning curve
8010513 it shops need to get solutions that are finely tuned for virtualization
8010514 when you run a test it disrupts employees and customers
8010515 the tests cause the same pain to their customers as if they had a real disaster

8010517 flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father who is in heaven
8010518 for i was hungry and you gave me food i was thirsty and you gave me drink i was a stranger and you welcomed me i was naked and you clothed me i was sick and you visited me i was in prison and you came to me
8010519 what are you talking about when did we do those things for you
8010520 hey jesus let me into heaven because i did this and this and this
8010521 what youre letting us into heaven why oh yeah because you died for us
8010522 so this time we have escalated the penalty to a black screen that reappears every hour until the user validates his or her copy of win xp pro
8010523 mdec respects the rights of companies to protect their intellectual property its a reminder that software piracy doesnt pay especially when malaysians are themselves putting a lot of effort into creating original software
8010524 microsoft has stopped selling win xp in the market so you have to wonder why it is spending time and money to take down users of pirated copies of this os
8010525 why isnt it also targeting users who have pirated copies of windows vista
8010526 so if im using a pirated copy of vista at this time i wont be hassled got to wonder about that
8010527 vista isnt pirated as much wga is continuous and should there be a vista piracy problem we will address it down the road

8010534 put simply financial returns from wine have not met our expectations mr johnston said yesterday
8010535 global trading conditions for wine continue to be competitive but the category remains in solid growth
8010536 we expect the beer market to remain resilient he said
8010537 it seems to be a little more of a problem than i anticipated
8010538 all you need is 200 people in that crowd to boo and stuff like that and it will be replayed 900 times and thats not what you want out of this
8010539 we need in the white house starting on january 20th barack obama and joe biden
8010540 still doesnt believe that women deserve equal pay for equal work
8010541 he doesnt believe that women deserve the right to choose
8010542 he would turn the clock back when what we need from our president is forward movement more progress the kind of opportunities that we expect for the next generation of americans
8010543 what obama has to have hillary do is stand up and say not only in words but its got to be almost method acting and say it in a way thats believable that she wants barack obama to be president
8010544 frankly goes toward any future political considerations she may have
8010545 when somebody is caught cheating of course its never an admirable thing to do but i still think theres a giant lack of national perspective on this crime a man is married 31 years you know people not just men women youre married a long time youre desperate for something new i mean men like new sex women like new shoes people like new you cant stop human nature the noble thing to do when youre married is to suck it up and suffer we all get that fine but its a shame that we have to lose a good message from an otherwise good man he was the guy who had the health care plan that they both copied his idea that we have two americas and in one of them hes single thats an important message
8010546 why cant god just defeat the devil and get rid of evil
8010547 one reason i have always been anti evangelical and people who take the bible literally is because it allows you to be horrible to animals people too slavery is ok with the bible keeping women down and honor killings and lets not even go into how bad they are to people but animals you know the bible says man can have dominion over animals and also they believe people have a soul whatever that is but animals dont so do whatever you want with them
8010548 caller i have a question do you think mccain will be just as bad or worse than bush im a first time voter and im barack all the way man maher ok dude its hard to say its hard to imagine a president being worse than bush but i could see mccain pulling it off i dont know mccain is a real hard one to figure because he could get into office and revert to the maverick mccain that we used to like he could say you know what i had to do a lot of stuff i didnt like to get to this spot which every politician has to do but now im here you cant touch me he can be better on a lot of issues than bush but on issues like iraq hes not he doesnt get the most fundamental thing about this war that it is our presence in that country that is the problem hes ok with leaving troops in iraq for a hundred years he said this he said look we have troops in germany and japan and south korea yes but theyre not muslim countries what irks them is just our presence there as long as we have troops in the heart of the middle east there will always be terrorist planners trying to kill us young muslim men who want to kill us for doing that so on that level alone i cant say hes better than bush
8010549 i think its no secret and ive said it to my israeli counterparts that i dont think the settlement activity is helpful to the process
8010550 what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
8010551 i believe that the parties have succeeded in moving their understandings of what needs to be achieved and indeed their positions somewhat closer together over this period of time
8010552 so we will continue to press ahead to get agreement so that we know what is in israel and what is in palestine that is ultimately the goal
8010553 initiated 433 new housing units during the period of january to may 2008 compared to just 240 units during the period january to may 2007
8010554 which still continue and which without a doubt are the main obstacle in the political process
8010555 just because we have not yet succeeded does not mean we have failed
8010556 the coming weeks will be decisive for the peace process we are at a crossroads and the efforts and the meetings will continue in order to build on the ideas presented for the first time today

8010723 my wife just went through a totally rude customer service experience with our local uhaul rep downright rude do they want the business
8010724 ive learned never to use uhaul they screwed up my move and offered me a 5 gift certificate
8010725 uhaul has quite the reputation poor customer service is almost an art form link to consumerist posts on uhaul
8010726 in my experience uhaul has some of the worst customer service i have ever experienced they dont care
8010727 uhaul hands down has the worst customer service i have ever dealt with in my life phone and face to face
8010728 some of the absolute worst customer service experiences i have ever had came from dealing with uhaul agents in halifax
8010729 after my move on saturday i hate uhaul awful service
8010730 thousands of horror stories about them im lucky my local uhaul is great
8010731 just back from maddening trip to uhaul to get our money back for failed hitch install contemplating my options
8010732 i will never use uhaul again i have had way too many problems with them bad equipment oversold equipment etc
8010733 ive rented some from them ive just walked in and turned off all my needs their cs people are just about useless
8010734 uhaul argh broken axel 115 degrees i 5 in san joaquin valley and they cannot find me took 6hrs to get back on the road
8010735 i hate uhaul reserved a trailer to move from boston to dc 6 weeks out only to find out when i called they didnt have one
8010736 got lots of uhaul horror stories worked there while in college where do i submit
8010737 my guess is many consumers arent aware of other choices and suffer through uhaul anyways
8010738 i think some companies survive in spite of horrendous service uhaul fails on many levels poorly maintained trucks too
8010739 uhaul sounds like the equivalent of the royal mail in the uk poor customer service rude never on time frequently lost items
8010740 im going to need a moving truck soon always just went with uhaul maybe i should try another company this time around

8010969 an american tank is filled with cheering iraqis who are for the first time tasting freedom and i for one am thankful that we have a military as capable as this and a commander in chief that had the courage not to listen to hollywood or the ny times or the french some have predicted that this action would create a hundred osama bin ladens i think today on the streets of baghdad there are tens of thousands of freedom fighters and i celebrate that
8010970 major league baseball has reversed its long standing opposition to instant replay and will allow umpires to check video on home run calls in series that start thursday a person familiar with the announcement told the associated press
8010971 we have these fake queues at front of 20 stores around the country to drum up interest in the iphone
8010972 has faced questions about the banks multi million dollar loans to michael gioranago a convicted bookmaker and prostitution ring promoter
8010973 is concerned by revelations that the bank owned by illinois democratic treasurer nominee alexi giannoulias family gave loans to a chicago crime figure and said the candidate owes him and the public a full accounting
8010974 newly discovered public records show broadway bank made 11 8 million in additional mortgage loans to giorango just last year giannoulias said he oversaw the servicing of those loans
8010975 was gunned down in an execution style slaying after selling the gambling fleet to a group that included indicted washington lobbyist jack abramoff
8010976 giannoulias is so tainted by reputed mob links that several top illinois dems including the states speaker of the house and party chairman refused to endorse him even after he won the democratic nomination with obamas help
8010977 j ust why did sen obama last week endorse for illinois treasurer an unknown 29 year old whose financial experience is limited to working at a family owned chicago bank and who as recently as five years ago was shooting professional hoops as point guard with team panionios of athens greece
8010978 everyone has these dreams in the communities and no ones going around and collecting them
8010979 merida is an embarrassment shame as a symbol of the opposition and we have to rescue it
8010980 the important thing is that the branches of the psuv get reactivated
8010981 the man has the right to make a statement like that
8010982 its up to us we understand the scheme all we have to do is execute it
8010983 i dont put pressure on him and say if we dont win 11 games
8010984 there are so many variables such as injuries and bad luck
8010985 look i dont want to jinx him or anything because hes playing at such a high level but people have to understand sometimes preseason is all about mistakes
8010986 you dont get that many plays usually everybody is tired from camp and there isnt a whole lot of game planning to get people free the way you want
8010987 so its rare just very rare its not something you see a lot in the situations youre in during the preseason thats for sure im really excited about the way hes playing i think we all are
8010988 thats kind of the biggest thing not turning the ball over sometimes youre going to get tipped passes and things like that but im happy with that thats kind of the goal
8010989 and heres the thing i think people can recognize how well hes playing but you have to see the guys in front of him theyre doing a tremendous job giving him time to throw and guys are making plays when the balls in the air
8010990 but i think everybodys got the feeling when they look at him in the huddle that were going to be able to move the ball
8010991 you have a guy hes like john elway that way who doesnt worry about his percentages all the time his stats who believes he can do it wants to do it and has the arm strength to do it so you work to use the whole field and see the opportunities that will come because of that
8010992 i dont know ive never been a big fumbler in the pocket or anything like that
8010993 i didnt feel like i looked at that more than anything else in the offseason you just work to limit mistakes and find the matchups i dont want to make mistakes i want us to move the ball put up some points and get some wins thats always the bottom line
8010994 everybody knows if youre the quarterback you cant turn the ball over if you do youre not going to be the quarterback
8010995 so its one of those things you just suck it up go about your business and try to have some fun with it
8010996 mike is a very mature guy so if he has to line up there he will
8010997 they want to see if there is any interest there
8010998 i was told all along that if something were to happen that this is a position i could find myself in
8010999 i am ready to step in there and hopefully there wont be a letdown at all
8011000 im more concerned with the team that we have right here in our locker room and that this team mentally prepares itself as best we can
8011001 as always well continue to research all of our options
8011002 i would have done whatever to try to get him back initially but now how could you not want him back
8011003 wouldnt that be something he comes back and we start a trend
8011004 as i know it he is probably on a beach somewhere sipping on some pina coladas so i doubt football is the first thing on his mind today
8011005 he has not been bouncing back and forth like brett favre
8011006 we know people are going to drive we want them in their cars for less time

8011048 i assume what you really want is insight about maree but im still collating that i really hate using the hindbrain but theres too much data to go through in too short a time i still guarantee ill outrun anyone else to good hypotheses and real answers about maree but youll have to wait until the midday meal break at least
8011049 i would rather eat with you and the remains of your admin team in the suite than go up top after all maree has left an open seat with her absence even my prodigous mass shouldnt rob you of too much maneuvering room in there
8011050 and itll be easier for you to read them than have me play storyteller but ill tell you the worst right now
8011051 the backdated warrants for that should be on your desk within minutes after i finish my story just make sure you use the sig pen that will be on top of the docs so that the timestamps will mesh in any case theyve been fornicating with use of multiple contraceptives for at least the past three months most of it here in the tower on breaks and after hours since they we still in gender segregated housing someone nicknamed enn has been helping them steer clear of security but from all indications after establishing how trustworthy and helpful he or she was and how adept at manipulating security systems enn finally reversed the agenda and sent a drone into where going at it when we caught them
8011052 possible but my intuition says not indications so far point to enn being someone outside your circle but with proximate access
8011053 so we have someone who knows how to move through our shadows and not trip real or virtual alarms someone who probably has connections to the death of the red pope and maybe the defection of maree as well someone who cannot penetrate our security deeply but who can do so just deeply enough to hurt us

8011149 kalau bapak berat menerima fatwa haram rokok dari mui dikarenakan pekerja itu berarti bapak sama dengan terangkan mengatakan boleh mencari uang dengan mencari menjual shabu2 narkotika ektasi bir bom vcd porno
8011150 jangan main dengan hukum hukum itu bersifat memaksa kalau hukum berkata kita harus menerima dengan ikhlas persetan dengan 7juta orang pekerja rokok kalau rokok haram semua harus dihentikan masi banyak orang bisa hidup selain dari pabrik rokok jangan pernah mui mengatakan rokok itu haram haram dan halal itu hanya milik allah saya mengatakn rokok itu mubah tidak berpahala tidak berdosa saya setuju kalau rokok itu dilarang tapi jangan diharamkan karena haram dan halal itu milik allah
8011151 dia menghalalkan bagi mereka yang baik dan mengharamkan yang buruk
8011152 buat apa ada ulama di dunia ini padahal sudah banyak yang mengabaikan nasehat ulama
8011153 saya tahu mengenai hadist tentang dilarangnya melakukan sesuatu yang merugikan diri sendiri tapi saya bukan ahlinya jadi saya menyerahkan kepada mui untuk itu tapi jelas kami menggalakkan gerakan anti rokok dimana
8011154 the struggle between narco trafficking has to be linked with the fight against terrorism
8011155 drug trafficking groups contribute to the financing of corruption and terrorism

8011169 there is not enough time remaining before diwali nov 1 is the date the city was planning to observe it to override him and observe the holiday this year council member brewer is confident that the council will override the mayor but it will probably happen at one of the two stated council meetings in november i believe 11 17 and 11 31 so the city will officially observe diwali next year this year november 1 falls on all saints day on which alternate side of the street parking is suspended anyway

8011171 if you see crime in a certain area of campus and you dont see police officers there
8011172 youre going to say why dont you put police there
8011173 universities are very difficult to map because the adresses are hard to find for some buildings
8011174 we think its a good idea to have that kind of geomapping kind of stuff so folks can realize where crimes are happening
8011175 we dont see any countrywide drivers in china indicating a slowdown

8011188 triggered star formation continues to be very hard to prove
8011189 but our preliminary analysis shows that the phenomenon can explain the multiple generations of stars seen in the w5 region
8011190 our first look at this region suggests we are looking at one or two generations of stars that were triggered by the massive stars
8011191 we plan to follow up with even more detailed measurements of the stars ages to see if there is a distinct time gap between the stars just inside and outside the rim
8011192 whether the brightest galaxies in clusters grew substantially in the last few billion years is intensely debated our observations show that in this time these galaxies have increased their mass by 50
8011193 most surprising is that in three of the four groups the brightest galaxy also has a bright companion galaxy these galaxy pairs are merging systems
8011194 as we near what we originally expected to be the full length of the mission we are all thrilled with how well the mission is going
8011195 in the first two cells we analyzed samples from the surface and the ice interface and the results look similar our objective for cell 3 is to use it as an exploratory cell to look at something that might be different
8011196 the appeal of stone soup is that this deep area may collect and concentrate different kinds of materials
8011197 the trough between polygons is sort of a trap where things can accumulate
8011198 over a long timescale there may even be circulation of material sinking at the margins and rising at the center
8011199 we had a shootout between stone soup and white stuff in a trench called upper cupboard
8011200 if we had been able to confirm that the white material was a salt rich deposit we would have analyzed that but we were unable to confirm that with various methods
8011201 and it shows just how high these clouds really are at the very edge of space

8011227 i believe that the extraordinary technology that we now have merits the use of instant replay on a very limited basis
8011228 the system we have in place will ensure that the proper call is made on home run balls and will not cause a significant delay to the game
8011229 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play
8011230 i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8011231 while the use of instant replay is an experiment we hope that over the balance of this season it will prove to be a success
8011232 between 2003 and 2006 faculty members across the disciplines have shown a marked decline in how devoted they are to libraries as information portals eighty percent of humanities scholars are still devoted to library research although that may be not because theyre traditionalists but because they cant yet get what they need in digital form but only 48 percent of economists and 50 percent of scientists value libraries as gateways
8011233 ive made a note of your suggestion that we add a question about the learning partner role should we pursue a 2009 faculty survey through other research areas and our affiliated organization nitle we have an ongoing interest in the support of teaching and learning and these surveys could do a better job of addressing these interests
8011234 i took a look at the data to see how questions addressing the value of the library varied between faculty who self reported seeing themselves as more of a teacher or as more of a researcher in general more faculty who considered themselves as primarily teachers felt that the role of the library had continuing importance than did those faculty who considered themselves primarily researchers

8011383 it wouldnt surprise me if they come up with a trumped up charge for me
8011384 hes just smart he understands the game and has got a lot of confidence hes an undersized guy so he works well in the slot our players just believe in him hes tough as hell and that helps
8011385 i dont know how we can keep him off the field right now to be honest with you
8011386 i had a better grasp of the offense i had a better grasp of what i could do better
8011387 it was just a matter of coming out letting it happen letting loose on the field
8011388 if you play scared or uncomfortable you kind of get exposed in the nfl
8011389 if youre on top of everything you do and play your best a lot of times you shine
8011390 youve got to make sure you dont mess up any routes
8011391 youve got to make plays when the ball is thrown in your direction and that you know all your assignments in the running game
8011392 some receivers are talented enough that they get away with barely having to block the rest of us have to make sure were on top of all our assignments
8011393 when you have a guy who you always know where hes going to be and always know hes going to be in the right spot it allows you to just let the ball go and trust what hes going to do and he always catches it he rarely has a drop
8011394 i guess thats the first step making that opening day roster the first and foremost goal then im just going from there
8011395 its easy to sit there and say well where does he fit in if andres back healthy youve got andre davis and kevin walter
8011396 he has a small fracture thats going to require fusion surgery to stabilize the spine
8011397 the surgery will fuse together the second and fourth vertebrae
8011398 everything a credit repair clinic can do for you legally you can do for yourself at little or no cost
8011399 we respect your viewpoint but we also respect the vision of the filmmaker and decided to use live animals
8011400 must be tricked sedated or forcibly restrained when the infants are pulled from them and this cruel practice leaves lifelong emotional scars
8011401 chimps should be with their mothers for the first five years
8011402 were a nonprofit were not staffed to do that kind of comprehensive oversight
8011403 if we are witnessing good care thats our focus to make the assumption that when they leave the set they will treat the animals differently is not something we do animals need consistency if youre treating an animal in training with positive rewards then youre not going to come to the set and beat it with a stick and expect the same results
8011404 no animals were harmed in the making of this film
8011405 with great apes were asking them to add that the aha is not present for the training of great apes prior to the animals being on the set
8011406 people have a false sense that because the aha is on set during a movie that disclaimer means that everything is ok its not
8011407 i saw a lot of physical violence a lot of punching and kicking and the use of the ugly stick a sawed off broom handle to beat the chimps the youngest i met were 18 months old and were pretty similar to an 18 month old human child they were being kicked in the face and punched in the head and subject to all kinds of physical abuse to keep them paying attention and in line with the trainer
8011408 its very similar to an abusive human relationship the bottom line is chimps are super strong and super curious and super smart and the amount of control that the trainers require to keep them paying attention and not misbehaving its too much to be able to do with love and kisses the way the trainers are able to control them is behind the scenes they have this very brutal relationship including discipline when they misbehave and random violence without any seeming provocation that keeps their attention on the trainer
8011409 the violence begins at birth and the chimps live so long
8011410 das war der gr te erfolg in diesem jahr ich bin rausgegangen und habe an mich geglaubt
8011411 das wird auch wieder schwer man nicht sagen die n chste runde wird einfach
8011412 wenn man sich hier eine woche lang ins bett legt kann man nicht viel erwarten
8011413 es ist wie verhext ich war hier noch kein jahr gesund
8011414 ich habe gehofft dass ich den ersten satz gewinne und er dann ein bisschen einbricht aber so habe ich keine chance gehabt
8011415 for years we have been planting martyrs in our midst
8011416 bovendien zijn er vooral in het begin allerlei maatregelen genomen die niet goed werkten of langzaam op gang kwamen
8011417 we vroegen ons al langer af of er grotere dieren zijn die het magnetisch gevoel gebruiken om de richting te bepalen
8011418 het kostte soms uren om een foto te vinden waarop we de grazende koeien konden zien
8011419 als we die uiteindelijk toch gevonden hadden konden we de kop niet van de kont onderscheiden gelukkig zagen we wel of ze in noordzuid richting stonden
8011420 no but im here to talk about indian americans not american indians
8011421 seems you cant walk into a 7 11 or valero on doniphan unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
8011422 not likely im only here for a minute can you give my rickshaw driver some water seems he cant pass a high class upper valley hacienda without asking for water in a slight indian accent im not joking
8011423 but be careful of that 7 11 at redd road the night shift guys all voted democrat last time around
8011424 bovendien was mijn naam verkeerd gespeld en dat zou ik ongetwijfeld hebben gecorrigeerd
8011425 theres no indication that shes in possession of or ever used a weapon
8011426 i dont think she has a criminal history besides this but obviously if you can kill a newborn and abduct a 4 year old i guess youd have to be considered at least dangerous to the safety
8011427 contrary to media reports britney was never slated to perform on this years vmas
8011428 shes in the middle of recording her next album which is going amazingly well and her focus remains on the studio
8011429 thats part of my role with glencross and bourque its a role i enjoy
8011430 thats our identity a team that plays hard every night
8011431 we have added a few guys that are a little younger a little stronger and a little faster the game has changed a little bit and i think that was why we were brought in we already had a good team before we got here anything we can do to make us better and help us win is all good for us
8011432 i just try to play hard every night get in on the forecheck and bump some bodies around and shoot the puck as much as i can

8011447 beyond being a high character kid and a strong student barnes is also sought after by practically every school in the country because he is a big time talent
8011448 as a physical small forward barnes has a quality inside outside scoring game can defend both forward positions rebounds at a high level and has a strong understanding of the game
8011449 i t would have been electrifying in my view had sen barack obama picked sen hillary clinton
8011450 ifhillary was chosen this would have electrified this place the democraticnational convention

8011459 let us put our minds together and see what kind of life we can make for our children
8011460 sputtered strain gauge manufacturers sputter deposit a layer of glass onto the diaphragm sputtered strain gauge sensors actually from a molecular bond
8011461 gauge pressure is measured relative to ambient atmospheric pressure as shown in figure 3 similar to absolute pressure the abbreviations pag pascals gauge or psia pounds per square inch gauge are use to describe gauge pressure
8011462 a classic example of overloading a pressure sensor is known as the water hammer phenomenon this occurs when a fast moving fluid is suddenly stopped by the closing of a valve the fluid has momentum that is suddenly arrested which causes a minute stretching of the vessel in which the fluid is constrained this stretching generates a pressure spike that can damage a pressure sensor
8011463 this scent conjures up that special moment when night time comes and envelops you in velvet
8011464 senator obama saying the question of when life begins is above his pay grade if he were to come to you and say help me out here madame speaker when does life begin what would you tell him
8011465 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time
8011466 and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition and senator st augustine said at three months we dont know
8011467 let men learn to love their children from the pious custom of the crows
8011468 lest their patrimony be divided among several deny their own fetus in their uterus and by a parricidal potion extinguish the pledges of their womb in their genital belly and life is taken away before it is transmitted
8011469 if the facts dont fit the theory change the facts
8011470 dont worry boss they cant do nothin til theyre through sparklin
8011471 confidence is still quite depressed but its a glimmer of hope from the lows we saw in june
8011472 i attribute the increase to the drop in gasoline prices which offset a deteriorating labor market
8011473 consumer confidence readings suggest the economy remains stuck in neutral but may be showing signs of improvement by early next year
8011474 the data today paint a mixed picture but its clear it will still take some time to work through the downturn in housing
8011475 sat on the sidelines opposing and delaying urgent reforms to our housing markets
8011476 as our housing market continues to struggle barack obamas plans for tax increases and government spending will cost jobs at a time when we need them most
8011477 after presenting at a few events like this i must say that yours is by far the best getting people in a room together is the easy part putting together the follow up process like you have is what sets it apart and really provides the value for both the entrepreneur and the angel investor

8011479 we are thrilled that this jury sent a strong message that they want these companies to compete in the marketplace and not the courtroom
8011480 its not the size of the dog in the fight its the size of the fight in the dog
8011481 u s small companies are a contrarian place to be right now
8011482 most people are still stuck on that large company bandwagon but quietly small companies are outperforming
8011483 we liked the strategy but we didnt think the timing was right in terms of where they were in the cycle

8011489 we wrote for seven months until i finally came to meet her i knew who to look for her room number i walked right into her room unannounced
8011490 i just feel plain excited weve talked about it a lot but never quite got around to doing it
8011491 the disclosure that a whitehall counter terrorism propaganda operation is promoting material to the bbc and other media will raise fresh concerns about official news management in a highly sensitive area
8011492 we are pushing this material to uk media channels eg a bbc radio programme exposing tensions between aq leadership and supporters and a restricted working group will communicate niche messages through media and non media
8011493 they are not heroes and dont have answers and that they harm you your country and your livelihood
8011494 it is aimed primarily but not exclusively at those working with overseas influencers and opinion formers
8011495 use advisedly avoid suggesting that aq is no longer a threat we are not claiming victory over aq we are stressing their declining support

8011499 all four petitioners were held and interrogated under appalling conditions in afghanistan by the united states before they were transported to guantanamo where they were systemically tortured and abused pursuant to directives from respondent rumsfeld and the military chain of command
8011500 deliberate interference with and denigration of their religious beliefs and practices including the deliberate submersion of the koran in a filthy toilet bucket
8011501 our hope is that at minimum each branch will come up with a standard way of getting information
8011502 if that doesnt work well consider bringing a suit in federal court
8011503 by refusing to provide reasonable and proper notice of such proceedings through timely objective and detailed court dockets the military justice system has severely undercut a foundational tenet of american democracy
8011504 oftentimes reporters and the public have trouble just finding out about a case and when and if a trial is going on
8011505 there have been too many instances of courts martial going on behind closed doors
8011506 it is just as much of a right for the public as the accused if the courts and their proceedings are always open the people who run them are going to be more inclined to follow the rules
8011507 you dont hire the goodyear blimp to talk about how many people you have court martialed
8011508 but transparency is part of running an armed force in a democratic society committed to the rule of law

8011518 lets work our hearts out to elect barack obama and joe biden our next president and vice president
8011519 shes going to tell her delegates and her supporters around the country it is time to enthusiastically come together to support senator obama to make him the next president and here are the reasons why
8011520 each speaker has one job at the democratic convention make the case for change that case begins with a resounding ringing indictment of the failed bush mccain policies in other words attack
8011521 all of us in the heat of the campaign and primary say words that we later regret
8011522 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
8011523 it looks like were slowly starting to dig out of this
8011524 it appears to be an internal software processing problem were going to have to do some forensics on it
8011525 we are about 100 000 short in the energy budget
8011526 all we do is come here twice a year to pay our taxes
8011527 for investors as a whole returns decrease as motion increases
8011528 we want to find a few durable businesses run by honorable people and buy at sensible prices
8011529 we dont focus on whether the company will make its numbers next quarter but on the durability of its competitive advantages over the next ten years
8011530 if you just focus on a few simple fundamentals and buy with a margin of safety then you go a long way to minimize true investment risk
8011531 people think i want to hold on to these resources what if something bad happens to one of my kids or one wants to start a business
8011532 a fund like this saves me time my most valuable resource
8011533 the mix of the fund matches the evolution of my financial needs
8011534 the track records of target date funds are not that long
8011535 we try to overweight sectors that will benefit from long term trends in supply and demand
8011536 we try to focus on stocks that are not dependent on a favorable stock market or a robust bond market
8011537 this is a historic day for hp and eds and for the clients we serve
8011538 independently each company is a respected industry leader together we are a global leader with the capability to serve our clients whatever their size location or sector with one of the most comprehensive and competitive portfolios in the industry
8011539 there is a longer schedule more demands on a kid
8011540 ages 11 to 14 and that is the middle school age and also kids that are entering into high school those are two very difficult transitions
8011541 they dont need to have you right there holding their hand
8011542 its never too young to start imbuing a child with a sense of confidence
8011543 and people will always be there to help them thats what you also want them to feel
8011544 staying home is not an option not getting an education is not an option and parents need to be very firm about that
8011545 we think its really going to build on our best practices and lessons learned from our operations in iraq but recognizing that it needs to be tailored to the local afghan population
8011546 the big thing that he came out of there with is they were doing a warehouse operation
8011547 the problem seems to be more the detention than the treatment
8011548 the numbers of true emergencies is far smaller than that
8011549 its a small number of true emergencies though there are some there are times when we have true emergencies and we need things quickly
8011550 its clear the fbi wants to minimize this as a mistake and not abuse
8011551 the facts are there was a ridiculous amount of misuse and abuse
8011552 so thatll be the tories showing how much they value women again
8011553 circle time the kids had to fight while the rest of the class watched and the teachers told them not to tell their parents warren said
8011554 some parents said their children were bruised during the fights and were in the process of setting up interviews with at least some of the 18 kids in the class
8011555 its going to take a while to sort it all out the teachers could face charges of endangering the welfare of minors if the allegations are true warren said
8011556 the church has already taken corrective action by terminating the teachers but well need to determine whether management knew about the alleged activity or whether it was isolated to the staff
8011557 were communicating with parents and trying very hard to earn their trust back
8011558 no one wants to sweep anything under the rug for sure
8011559 the kids told one story while the teachers told another but ultimately the investigation will have to determine that

8011564 todo sumado arroja un balance que no quisiera yo mezclar directamente con la tragedia de barajas que ni es el nico aeropuerto colapsado ni spanair es la nica compa a que act a bajo presi n
8011565 esperemos que en la investigaci n que se abra sobre este tremendo accidente que hoy nos tiene acongojados caiga quien caiga quien deba de caer lo que ya no se puede decir y confiemos en que no nos lo digan es que todo se debe a la mala suerte a un conjunto de circunstancias imponderables e inevitables
8011566 hay quien ve en la denuncia de cada caso particular un inter s espurio por qu hay gentes incapaces de ver la grandeza de la cr tica de la denuncia justificada
8011567 los periodistas creo que tenemos la obligaci n de contar lo que pensamos que est mal y si podemos hacerlo en primera persona porque nos ha ocurrido a nosotros y creemos que puede ser un mensaje que modifique conductas pues mejor
8011568 the statement in my view shows that the eu mission has turned out to be something worse than a farce
8011569 we shall in the coming days and weeks see what we can do to expose the pack of lies and innuendoes that characterise the garbage in this report
8011570 if they can go out and put them up they can go back out there and take them down
8011571 someone wants to make a quick profit on their junk and have someone else clean up after them
8011572 i dont think weve had a huge issue with signs

8011576 the number one killer among people with kidney disease is heart disease just like in the rest of the population except that in people with kidney disease the heart disease exhibits an accelerated course
8011577 kidney disease puts a person at significantly higher risk for cardiovascular disease but it is often asymptomatic even as late as stage three
8011578 the more definitively we can characterize renal disease the closer we are to effectively treating both it and its comorbid conditions

8011584 low oxygen levels in canals in golden gate estates are to blame for reports of hundreds of dead fish this week county pollution monitors said today vegetation washed into the canal system by tropical storm fay is sucking oxygen out of the water as it decays collier county pollution control specialist rhonda watkins said watkins said the county got complaints monday of dead fish in canals between eighth and tenth streets southwest at the end of fourth street southeast at the end of seventh street southwest and in the canal south of 16th avenue southwest some reports cited an oil slick on the waters surface but watkins said decaying vegetation can create conditions that look similar to an oil slick but break apart more easily not all of the fish in the canals had died and the dead fish seemed to be similar sizes and mostly tilapia with a few bass a pattern attributable to low oxygen levels watkins said she said a chemical pollutant would cause a more widespread fish kill watkins said meters recorded oxygen levels of less than 1 milligram per liter sportfish need at least 3 milligrams per liter of oxygen to survive between 5 and 8 milligrams per liter is ideal watkins said

8011587 most comprehensive look at the arts and cultural industries yet
8011588 arts and culture contributed 46 billion to canadas economy in 2007 but the overall impact of the sector was a much broader 84 6 billion
8011589 it attributes 1 1 million jobs to arts and culture or to spinoff industries such as tourism
8011590 culture has less tangible benefits such as helping people of diverse backgrounds understand each other
8011591 few people argue for a market only approach for the sale of airplanes largely because public support is recognized as a necessary pre condition to global commercial success the same may be true in the cultural industries as we move from a world of scarcity limited bandwidth and access to culture to one of abundance near unlimited access to culture canadian policies must shift from unworkable regulations that limit access to foreign content toward efforts that back the creation and promotion of canadian content in other words cutting off funding for promotion is not just bad cultural policy it is bad economic policy
8011592 the announced cuts move canada in the opposite direction for example just as the government was cutting 11 7 million to the canadian memory fund which gives federal agencies money to digitize their collections and post them online the european union which is currently led by the conservative french president nicolas sarkozy was committing nearly 200 million next year alone toward digitization and efforts to provide online access to europes cultural heritage the european commission has urged its member states to increase their digitization budgets as europe works toward the creation of a massive european digital library

8011596 the court will deny the executives request for a stay
8011597 hence the executive should respond to the document aspect of the subpoenas by producing non privileged material and identifying more specifically the materials it is withholding on a claim of executive privilege
8011598 it is on ms mierss appearance that the dispute principally focuses this decision should not however foreclose the parties continuing attempts to reach a negotiated solution both sides indicated that discussions regarding an accommodation have resumed
8011599 has failed to demonstrate that it has a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of the absolute immunity issue or that it has even raised a question
8011600 the executives argument boils down to a claim that a stay is appropriate because the underlying issue is important
8011601 but that is beside the point and does not demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits simply calling an issue important primarily because it involves the relationship of the political branches does not transform the executives weak arguments into a likelihood of success or a substantial appellate issue hence the court concludes that this prong of the stay pending appeal analysis cuts strongly in favor of the committee
8011602 toward that end and hopefully as a prelude to meaningful discussions between us i propose that members of our respective staffs meet as early as next week to re commence discussing possibilities for reaching an accommodation between the branches in this matter
8011603 as i know you appreciate this litigation is very important in determining constitutional contours governing certain relations between the executive and legislative branches in the congressional oversight setting
8011604 accordingly the department of justice has now filed an appeal in this matter and is also seeking a stay of the decision pending review by the u s court of appeals for the d c circuit
8011605 that course of action will provide appellate consideration of the novel questions at stake in this matter and will enable the parties to obtain if it should prove necessary a final decision in this important matter however the fact that the executive has notice an appeal in this matter does not signify that we think further litigation is the exclusive path forward
8011606 represents the best hope of promoting an accommodation between the two branches
8011607 had the litigants indicated that a negotiated solution was foreseeable in the near future the court may have stayed its hand in the hope that further intervention in this dispute by the article iii branch would not be necessary
8011608 as it stands however the court must decide the questions presented to it but there is still ample time for the parties to reach an accommodation the courts july 31 2008 order does not compel ms miers to appear at any particular date
8011609 todays ruling clearly rejects the white houses efforts to run out the clock on the committees investigation of doj politicization this congress
8011610 i am heartened that judge bates recognized that the public interest in this matter is best served by the furtherance of the committees investigation the committee intends to promptly schedule a hearing with ms miers and stands ready as always to consider any reasonable offer of accommodation with the white house
8011611 the executive cannot identify a single judicial opinion that recognizes absolute immunity for senior presidential advisors in this or any other context
8011612 in fact there is supreme court authority that is all but conclusive on this question and that powerfully suggests that such advisors do not enjoy absolute immunity the court therefore rejects the executives claim of absolute immunity for senior presidential aides
8011613 the aspect of this lawsuit that is unprecedented is the notion that ms miers is absolutely immune from compelled congressional process the supreme court has reserved absolute immunity for very narrow circumstances involving the presidents personal exposure to suits for money damages based on his official conduct or concerning matters of national security or foreign affairs the executives current claim of absolute immunity from compelled congressional process for senior presidential aides is without any support in the case law
8011614 a limited number of u s attorneys could be targeted for removal and replacement
8011615 if he mislead parliament that would be grounds for sacking
8011616 hs interesting nothing illegal or unusual in a politican seeking donations
8011617 i thought to my self wow is that a metaphor or not
8011618 then perhaps you would grace the english language with those words rather than slang from a foreign country
8011619 in your warped thinking waiting for enough evidence to form a judgement is support
8011620 and you wonder why i always race better than you
8011621 nous sommes desol s que notre president soit un idiot nous navons pas vote pour lui
8011622 we are sorry that our president is an idiot we didnt vote for him
8011623 its just when i try to read proust or heaven forbid
8011624 his theory provides the foundation for understanding the new phenomena his namesake telescope will discover
8011625 this is like the night sky at a fourth of july celebration but were seeing it on a cosmic scale
8011626 being able to pull that signal out from all the other busy activity that is going on all the other gamma ray traffic is going to take some time
8011627 its working exactly the way it is supposed to do
8011628 how can any progressive look themselves in the mirror after the election if mccain wins and they have not devoted at least some time to the obama campaign
8011629 i promise to appoint more justices to the supreme court like roberts
8011630 when i was a child i thought as a child but when i grew up i put away childish things
8011631 religion is for people who need religion harmony is for everyone
8011632 and we could have actually gotten something done if the last three years of clintons presidency werent spend defending something that his accusors have probably done with their own daughters
8011633 people think contradictions are sexy so they try to describe themselves as having contradictions
8011634 not to say that apixaban is buried but this initial poor result is another in a string of poor partnering decisions that pfizer has recently made
8011635 based on the karahi the traditional indian wok commonly used for simmering curries and stews stir frying and deep frying this infused anodized wok is ideal for recreating the favorite dishes you enjoy at indian restaurants its interior sears and browns perfectly and develops the rich caramelized flavor essential for creating delicious pan sauces adapted from the karahis customary round bottom this woks flat bottom makes it easy to use on western stoves two beautifully shaped loop handles inspired by graceful scrollwork on indian architecture allow you to carry the oven safe pan to the table for serving in authentic indian style
8011636 our policy does not permit us to respond with the generosity you had anticipated
8011637 to support the spirit pilots and their efforts to fight against the irresponsible actions of spirit management
8011638 training education and activities that will shine a spotlight on the activities of spirits increasingly out of touch management with its workforce its customers and its business model
8011639 from the often offensive advertising campaigns to the unethical treatment of their employees managements actions have destroyed much of the reputation and customer base of spirit airlines
8011640 with the backing of our national union we will work to restore the proud tradition of spirit airlines that we helped build and make it a great place to work and a great airline to fly
8011641 since the investors seem unwilling to rein him in its up to the employees to force this company back on track

8011665 we met for lunch and i looked around the restaurant
8011666 there was only one other person there and i didnt know it was guy and he said to me jeffrey im like guy i dont know why because he doesnt change that much but theres something about him and i think a lot of great actors have this he wants to disappear into his parts
8011667 roy clayton is more understanding of samirs position than anybody else in the fbi actually is
8011668 what they have in common is that roys father was a baptist minister and samirs father was a religious man as well
8011669 when guy and i first sat down to look at the script he was enthusiastic about it
8011670 he said look jeffrey i normally have a lot of notes i have to say i dont have many notes on this script but lets literally go through it page by page and look at every line and we did and he would analyze sometimes down to a contraction saying i do not versus i dont that type of thing for guy could be important
8011671 ill generally write out every scene thats in the film on a couple of pieces of paper just with a little one line
8011672 and then i can scan it a bit and go this first third of the film generally im kind of calm then i might do something on one piece of paper that just relates to the energy of the character
8011673 ive got a bit of obsessive compulsive disorder i think so i can get a little obsessed about detail stuff
8011674 i would feel quite anxious around people and be nervous that i was going to get asked some question i couldnt answer and i wasnt going to know what to say
8011675 on stage youve got dialogue youve learned youve got a paying audience it couldnt be better you know my therapist would say its probably because of having lost my dad when i was really young and that being a really tragic thing that i was worried about what was potentially around the corner being really disastrous so in doing a play or doing some structured work as an actor its set thats probably why i was drawn to it in a way
8011676 it was a pivotal film for me and quite a good representation of what im interested in
8011677 it probably enabled a little more confidence i tend to project my father figure onto any director that im working with or mother if im working with a female or it can be confused but chris nolans trusting me was really important and just allowed me to trust myself more
8011678 it was a bit of a breakdown actually and i was smoking a lot of pot leading up to that time as well and that clearly didnt help at all
8011679 id just been taking opportunity after opportunity after opportunity i didnt have my own direction going on so it was really about decompressing and i was seeing a therapist and i just needed to take stock

8011684 we do not know what to do with the pigeon
8011685 but for the time being it will remain behind bars
8011686 we have these fake queues at front of 20 stores around the country to drum up interest in the iphone
8011687 it was on your hand how could you not see it
8011688 i looked up at that flame and i thought i get to see this
8011689 it was just very compelling to me that there was just a host of great high caliber leadership
8011690 particularly chancellor gearhart whom ive known for quite some time and brad choate pontious earned a bachelors degree from heidelberg college in tiffin ohio and has completed course work toward a master of education degree
8011691 you are a ninja your god like speed dexterity jumping power and reflexes are all the result of an amazingly fast metabolism sadly so is your lifespan of 1 5 minutes like all ninjas you have an unquenchable thirst for gold a natural propensity for exploring rooms infested by increasingly lethal ninja killing robots and a devout belief in n
8011692 youll never know which part of the internet youll need
8011693 we considered that because the ad had not explained the limitations viewers were likely to expect to be able to see all the content on a website normally accessible through a pc rather than just having the ability to reach the website
8011694 every parent wants the most outstanding place for their child and there should be enough to go round
8011695 the proportion of daycare providers inspected with good or outstanding childcare has risen from 53 in 2005 06 to 64 in 2007 08 though the proportion of childminders judged good or outstanding has fallen from 65 to 59
8011696 parents should keep the ofsted reports in perspective its the experience of one inspector on one day and they fulfil an important function in keeping things safe but the school gate and nursery car park are the best places to find out what a nursery is like
8011697 though only a small proportion of childcare settings are inadequate that masks the fact that there are almost twice as many inadequate childminders this year providers judged to be inadequate have significant improvements to make if they are to meet the demands of the eyfs and provide the high quality education and care children deserve
8011698 its heartening that childcare in this country is improving but we want to drive up standards even further that is why we are introducing the eyfs in september which will give every child equal right to the best quality care and learning
8011699 i played it song for his mother and brother we cried our eyes out
8011700 if mccain is the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8011701 lets give em republicans four more months and then elect barack obama because barack obama will restore prosperity and will make the changes we need to write a new chapter in the story of the promise of america thank you very much
8011702 one thing thats interesting is that the two tracking polls
8011703 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8011704 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8011705 i can say without doubt now that there will be no more displays here at molineux
8011706 this gentleman hit the stand and was promptly dragged off by his parachute landing on the track in front of the main stand to say the ground went quiet was an understatement
8011707 the worst bit apart from watching a man fall approximately the height of two houses was that there were six other parachutists behind him and the man on the pa system was shouting for them to land elsewhere as villa park is surrounded by terraced houses and the m6 they had little choice but to land on the pitch parachutist no2 had seen his mate hit the one stand and in avoiding that missed the opposite stand by inches as everyone in the stadium held their breath the other five landed in goals on corner flags and anywhere but the cross in the middle of the pitch
8011708 lillestr m sk needed to beat troms at home while rosenborg had to lose points away at brann for lillestr m to take the title
8011709 at half time nothing was decided lillestr m were doing their job leading troms 2 0 while rosenborg were leading 2 1 in bergen
8011710 but during the half time break a parachutist who was supposed to land on the field instead hit the roof of the stands punching a hole and this caused a half hour delay to the start of the second half while the fire brigade came to the rescue by the time the second half started rosenborg were leading 4 1 in bergen and had secured their 10th successive league title
8011711 after seeing southampton defender michael svenssons almost fairytale return to action after nearly three years out with injury
8011712 i was wondering what the longest time out injury period is that a player has endured before returning to the first team of a football club
8011713 i reckon marc overmars recent return to a dutch second division side must be an example of the longest time out of football before returning
8011714 i would guess the longest time out of the first team would be those players who careers spanned either side of the second world war
8011715 from september 1939 till the resumption of fa cup matches in the 1945 46 season or even longer if their demob was held up until 1947
8011716 the swiss portuguese who only recently married failed to notice that his newly obtained wedding ring was caught in the barrier until he jumped back down and both the ring and most of his finger did not come with him
8011717 unable to re attach his severed digit advised the amputation of the remaining stump
8011718 with all the fuss about ashley coles im not greedy claims i was wondering if any player has ever actually come out and just admitted i moved for the money
8011719 if i was single and never had lisa and josh fiancee and son i maybe wouldnt have made the move to russia but i signed a five year contract and i have other ambitions to play in england italy spain or france
8011720 they are offering me a wonderful four year deal i could earn three times as much as i do know at anderlecht i know everton are not a top club they dont play in europe

8011722 since paul jewells appointment as derby manager on 28 november 2007 he has yet to win a match in 28 attempts in the league
8011723 what is the longest period of time since being appointed that a manager has kept his job without overseeing a league win for his team
8011724 having read that graeme souness once sold a young deco id like to know which manager or club is most culpable for letting future superstars slip through their fingers without their coach even recognising their talent
8011725 what was the last case of a club actually carrying out the threat guila beat juventud independiente 10 0

8011759 there will be no facility like this anywhere in northwest arkansas not even at the university
8011760 there will be nothing like this in the state of arkansas and few places like this in the united states outside of the universities
8011761 the goal from the beginning has been to create comprehensive cancer care in northwest arkansas
8011762 its not a new concept but its just hard to do you have all these layers and people coming together that have to all be on the same page where it may have taken five to eight weeks to see everyone and come up with a plan before everything youre going to need will be right here together you could have your whole plan put together in a week
8011763 everything with all of these groups with be coordinated in a one record system
8011764 so radiation and chemotherapy for example with be able to coordinate appointments were more familiar with each other now because well be working together in the same building this goes beyond the physicians i believe it uncomplicates the process for patients theres a peace that comes with knowing everythings taken care of theres a definite psychological impact with this
8011765 were a support service so this is a wonderful opportunity to reach the greatest number of clients and serve the most cancer patients we already receive referrals from narti highlands oncology and other physicians but this makes it so much easier
8011766 how would you want it for yourself or your family thats how we need to do it in this community
8011767 this instrument enables nasa and the nation to have a unique capability for atmospheric research particularly as related to cloud climate feedback and aerosol cloud interactions the global hawk platform is capable of sustained high altitude operation with potential to circumnavigate the globe on a single flight because it is unmanned the global hawk can fly longer and can operate in regions currently inaccessible to our airborne platforms such as southern oceans or antarctica
8011768 the long duration flights possible with the global hawk platform present unique challenges for science instrumentation sigma had the opportunity to apply all its expertise in aerospace instrument engineering in this project we are grateful to be able to contribute to this unique tool for atmospheric research
8011769 we are currently working with gsfc also on the first wind lidar for high altitude platforms together these two instruments would provide a singular capability for hurricane path prediction

8011772 for investors as a whole returns decrease as motion increases
8011773 we want to find a few durable businesses run by honorable people and buy at sensible prices
8011774 we dont focus on whether the company will make its numbers next quarter but on the durability of its competitive advantages over the next ten years
8011775 if you just focus on a few simple fundamentals and buy with a margin of safety then you go a long way to minimize true investment risk
8011776 people think i want to hold on to these resources what if something bad happens to one of my kids or one wants to start a business

8011778 u s small companies are a contrarian place to be right now
8011779 most people are still stuck on that large company bandwagon but quietly small companies are outperforming
8011780 we liked the strategy but we didnt think the timing was right in terms of where they were in the cycle
8011781 the fact that its a period of transition in the u s certainly makes it easier for the russians to act provocatively
8011782 there was this narrow calculation of the american political calendar
8011783 will not be able to muster much of a response
8011784 russia correctly believes that a new president tends to be under pressure to show a certain amount of toughness in foreign policy
8011785 part of it lies in prime minister vladimir putins personality hes a former kgb guy very cold very pragmatic he sees opportunities to seize gains and he takes them thats what happened with georgia the whole episode has emboldened russia
8011786 we want to make sure that beyond the glitz and the confetti and the celebrity that we talk about the facts
8011787 barack obama is a charming and fine person with a lovely family but hes not ready to be president of the united states
8011788 wed still be the land of liberty and a great nation but im afraid that the policies of barack obama would make america a weaker nation
8011789 barack obama was awol nowhere to be found on the issue of immigration
8011790 when you talk to democrats theres a lot of disunity
8011791 a country that was emboldened to roll over georgia and rip off its territory is not going to get frightened by the wto or the g8 they are past that now
8011792 if they feel that a western orientation is not an option they will be looking for friends where they can find them starting with tehran and caracas
8011793 i think you will now see a more unified position that russia is clearly overstepping its bounds and must be contained
8011794 im not saying we should support them secessionist movements in russia im saying thats a potential option
8011795 if the russians are playing a dirty game we shouldnt be a nice guy this is not a vicars tea party
8011796 there has been a change to the pay structure and difficulties have been encountered
8011797 we have spoken to the head of health support and they have promised the problem would be fixed
8011798 it is a common occurrence and not just in orange
8011799 from my previous experience when i worked in the north sydney health service it was a common occurrence towards the end of each financial year
8011800 gwahs endeavours to pay all of its creditors within agreed terms however gwahs acknowledges that some creditors have not been paid within those terms as agreed
8011801 in the past they were very slow to pay their account
8011802 now they pay on time for the newspapers it is usually within the week
8011803 theres been an upsurge in ascii spam in the last week its quite effective in getting through filters
8011804 the downside is that nine times out of ten its completely useless because its almost impossible to read or its a really bizarre picture of a naked lady thats not clickable
8011805 cialis 1 99 made it past both the spam filter of both my yahoo mail and gmail account
8011806 we expect spammers to use every means possible to try to send spam thats why we have a very robust spam fighting effort at google

8011895 everyone is very upset about the news lee had worked here since 1999 and was a vital piece of wjhs
8011896 i personally loved her deep hearty laugh and complete honesty about critical issues
8011897 she didnt just believe in teaching her curriculum she believed in shaping young lives to be better citizens she had such a total picture of what education should truly be for all students and created ways to celebrate each students individual strengths
8011898 she will continue to be an inspiration to me our faculty students and community
8011899 i think the public really wants to know what that projection is
8011900 i think this is the right thing to do at this time
8011901 unless people come to me and talk to me about it between now and then i probably will be voting no when it comes to the full quorum court

8011926 la decisione di partecipare al concorso con questopera segna una svolta nel mio essere artista il passaggio verso unarte pi impegnata
8011927 nasce dalla necessit di diffondere larte al di fuori degli spazi convenzionali tra la gente comune anche tra quelle persone che mai si sognerebbero di entrare in una galleria o in un museo larte dovrebbe essere un modo di comunicare immediato e universale non riservato ad un lite
8011928 suliman ci fa sapere infatti che appena unora prima dalla nostra conversazione i morti a kalma campo profugo di niala sono saliti a 37 e i feriti a 100 in seguito agli attacchi governativi che non sono mai cessati dal finto accordo di pace di abuja
8011929 web alive will help businesses deal with one of the major drawbacks of most communication technologies today the ability to give users a real life experience that is more interactive and intuitive for example if youre participating in a conference call today it is difficult to have sidebar conversations to know who else is in the meeting who is speaking and the relationship or business history of all the participants web alive will address those issues by pulling together the it and telecom worlds to give each avatar access to a wealth of information in ways we have never seen before
8011930 so that customer avatars can not only interact with each other but also with a companys customer service avatar
8011931 that call is good and im all for it but the problem is the psc is a government entity and the nsas are private in nature so technically the call is needed chairman ramirez is right but the question now is will the nsas listen to that call
8011932 i wholeheartedly agree with chairman ramirez because right now with the way nsas are performing and for us a country that loves sports we have not really enjoyed or experienced winning an olympic gold
8011933 the sea games is nothing compared to the olympics in the 1940s and 1950s the philippines was a major sports superpower in asia but now the philippines is relegated to a whipping boy if people think that the sea games is something to cheer about yes it is something to cheer about but on the global stage the sea games is like childs play
8011934 the situation in the philippines is not the same in situations in other countries if you notice the countries that win a lot of gold medals in the olympics like china cuba everything is run by the government ang us naman and other countries everything is private tayo hybrid ang may hawak ng pera gobyerno ang bumubuo ng mga teams ang namimili ng mga coach mga nsas so its going to be hard for the government to interfere internally
8011935 mahirap ayusin ang system kasi iba ang may hawak sa pera iba ang mga may hawak sa atleta thats the first thing that they have to address the systemic problem
8011936 there was a sports summit already back in the time of president fidel ramos i was the head of the ncr delegation apat na gabi kaming nagpuyat to craft a covenant for philippine sports in the following year there was another one and there was a third one ang problema kasi tuwing nagapalit ng liderato lalo na sa psc parang binubura nila yung kasaysayan yung ginagawa ng mga nauna pag hindi nila ideya pinapalitan nila
8011937 ang nangyayari dyan pag naging pinuno ako ng nsa ang ilalagay kong regional directors mga bata ko rin para ako ng ako ang iboboto nila yun ang nangyayari kahit palpak nang palpak ang athletes natin yun ang hindi na napapalitan yun ang hindi pwedeng pakialaman ng psc nasa ilalim ng poc philippine olympic committee yun
8011938 let us focus on sports that can really benefit us and not dwell on failures that have befallen our country in the past
8011939 for example what if we only send athletes that are lets say if you are one second two seconds away from the world record mark punta ka you qualify for the rp team hindi yung sige punta ka dahil wala tayong ipapadala hindi pwede yung ganon eh
8011940 si yao ming nadiskubre sa china mga 8 to 10 years old pa lang at nakita nilang lalaki siya ng 73
8011941 michael phelps fourteen ang naging gold medal niya phelps didnt hit the pool six or seven years ago he was already winning golds in athens ang mga swimmers natin maliliit naman kung itatabi sa kanya thats what im saying lets pick our athletes
8011942 kasi pag asian games andyan na ang india andyan na ang china andyan ang japan andyan ang korea who are all powerhouses lets take that asian games as a stepping stone
8011943 if we start tomorrow by 2016 we will see progress thats what eight years from now so yung atletang hinahanap natin ngayon eight years old pa lang
8011944 the philippines needs to develop a national program that will not only invite filipinos abroad to come home occasionally and render a few medical missions but to entice them to stay on and actually work in the country
8011945 hybrid models that shift from gasoline fuel to electric power at the touch of a button
8011946 we should remember the memorandum of agreement on ancestral domain is a minority versus majority issue and if it would always be the tyranny of the majority that would be imposed the aspirations of the minority would never be realized
8011947 energy was the story today with the bounce in the oil stocks being a reaction to the news of the hurricane
8011948 weve had some failures already so this watch list has garnered a lot of attention
8011949 and its not the number of banks so much as the size
8011950 the conclusion is the weak are going to get weaker and the strong will be able to take advantage of the weak
8011951 we think we will see prices falling until the fourth quarter of 2010 there will be more write downs at financial institutions and a lot more problems for consumers
8011952 i think theres a lot of speculation that maybe the shareholders will get bailed out so shareholders think if i buy this at 3 to 5 a share and the shareholders get bailed out im going to do great theyre certainly not doing it on the basis of fundamentals
8011953 american businesses and consumers were facing elevated borrowing costs and reduced credit availability
8011954 the overall mood is still one of caution theres not much out there to get investors excited
8011955 but the bigger picture is that there hasnt really been a major breakdown considering all the bad headlines out there from higher oil prices to the credit crisis and troubled housing sector
8011956 new and exciting business venture that i should sign up for
8011957 the electronic systems which guarantee our safety aboard the ss free gaza and ss liberty have been jammed and scrambled both ships are flying greek flags and are in international waters we are the victims of electronic piracy we are currently in gms p area a2 and we are relying on our satellite communications equipment to make a distress call if needed we are civilians from 17 nations and are on this project to break the siege of gaza we are not experienced sailors as a result there is concern about the health and safety of the people on board such an emergency develop we are currently experiencing rough sea conditions and we call on the greek government and the international community to meet their responsibilities and protect the civilians on board our two ships in international waters
8011958 the siege that the israelis have imposed on gaza is not only illegal in terms of international law it is also immoral global institutions and the governments of the world know what is happening and are not doing anything about it
8011959 your wife is in great danger these ships will be blown up
8011960 defense officials favor forcefully blocking two boats which a group of u
8011961 israel may use force to halt boat trying to break gaza siege
8011962 weve been waiting a long time to unify our group which has been split between cyprus and crete we are excited to combine both groups who have worked so hard on this project and are so enthusiastic about setting out for gaza on the way in today we had the cypriot authorities escorting us now its time for the world to escort us to gaza
8011963 it was exhilarating to watch the boats come in after waiting so patiently over the past two weeks
8011964 said a delighted fathi jaouadi one of the passengers on board
8011965 on the 14th of august 2008 an anonymous man called my home in france as my daughters played hide and seek in the garden this stranger spoke to my husband warning him that your wife is in great danger these ships will be blown up my husband asked how it was this person had obtained our private home number no response was forthcoming but the illicit threats carried on
8011966 the illegal exploitation of family members who in most instances are not suspects themselves has on many occasions caused severe psychological suffering to interrogees and to their innocent relatives in more extreme cases this method takes the form of psychological torture of a detainee rendering him a victim of a cruel psychological manipulation via the illegal exploitation of a close relative
8011967 defense officials favor forcefully blocking two boats which a group of u s based activists plan to sail to gaza a position paper by the foreign ministrys legal department says israel has the right to use force against the demonstrators as part of the oslo accords the foreign ministrys paper means that security forces could detain the vessels upon entry to gazas territorial waters arrest the passengers and haul the ship to israel where the detainees could be interrogated
8011968 no one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century
8011969 is that it just a man in a waistcoat on stage
8011970 the chances of anything coming from mars are a million to one he said
8011971 a gentle rain falls softly on my weary eyes as if to hide a lonely tear my life will be forever autumn cause youre not here
8011972 with persistent volatilities in global commodities markets monetary officials are unlikely to abandon their hawkish stance as yet and this is indeed what they have lately been signaling
8011973 its much more important to move a kid from below basic to basic thats an important step

8011978 the side with my face is a representation of when i had a seizure in december 1998 i stiffened and fell flat on my face on a hardwood floor but i have no memory of the event later my face and persona were not recognizable to me i had a broken nose chipped teeth and one eye swollen closed
8011979 the absolute weight doesnt matter it depends on how long you try to hold it
8011980 if i hold it for a minute thats not a problem if i hold it for an hour ill have an ache in my right arm if i hold it for a day youll have to call an ambulance
8011981 in each case its the same weight but the longer i hold it the heavier it becomes
8011982 and thats the way it is with stress management if we carry our burdens all the time sooner or later as the burden becomes increasingly heavy we wont be able to carry on
8011983 as with the glass of water you have to put it down for a while and rest before holding it again when were refreshed we can carry on with the burden
8011984 so before you return home tonight put the burden of work life down dont carry it home you can pick it up tomorrow
8011985 whatever burdens youre carrying now let them down for a moment if you can
8011986 if there is a light at the end of the tunnel its probably a train coming the other way
8011987 people with good directions do not have the adventures i have
8011988 it is a hard move for us to make but we are doing this out of principle that we feel that bad behavior by the dnc can not be rewarded with our vote

8011990 i generally enjoy a sock on both my left foot and my right
8011991 up your arse im old enough to say whatever i like
8011992 come on men white men men of my class are just better at this stuff
8011993 it seems to me to be unconvincing that a huge large amount of money will improve your reputation it just means that your lawyers are better than the other persons lawyers but to have the court stating that certain things are untrue seems to me to be emphatic
8011994 over the years i have been a part of the hurly burly of the british press and there has been plenty that has been said about me that has been rude and unsupportive i have never sought to pursue expressions of opinion however facts are facts and lies are lies and it seems to me that the law exists to allow people to clarify that
8011995 pioneered a new way of reconciling the right to freedom of speech with the right to reputation you nail the lie for all time with a court ordered declaration of falsity and you receive your legal costs but you decline to chill free speech by putting authors and publishers through an expensive trial and making them pay heavy damages
8011996 very noticeable for his shock of red hair his very bucolic clothes and his enormous eyes which seemed to be trained upon me
8011997 it was a marvellous thing to live in the functional light drenched architecture
8011998 no one at the guardian wanted to learn about architecture
8011999 she was talking about how she thinks itll be better than any album shes put out so far the last song we did together is my favorite song ive done since apologize or bleeding love or whatever its very haunting

8012002 la carrera de ayer era nueva para m ser a una de las pocas que me quedaban por correr en el extranjero me pareci muy divertida a la vez que exigente el constante sube y baja con el curveo y las cuatro gotitas de agua que nos acompa aron durante todo el d a la hicieron dura de verdad mis sensaciones fueron bastante buenas aunque no me sent a c modo al cien por cien al ponerme de pie sobre todo noto que no hago la misma fuerza con la pierna izquierda que con la derecha hecho que ya me hab a observado el masajista lo bueno es que conforme pasaban los kil metros me iban remitiendo las sensaciones de incomodidad y me sent a m s sim trico en la bici

8012024 i am absolutely certain that generations from now we will be able to look back and tell our children that this was the moment when we began to provide care for the sick and good jobs to the jobless this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal this was the moment when we ended a war and secured our nation and restored our image as the last best hope on earth this was the moment this was the time when we came together to remake this great nation so that it may always reflect our very best selves and our highest ideals

8012041 to compact an illustrious and interesting event into the space of two or three hours to make the characters appear only when they ought to come forth never to leave the stage empty to put together a plot as probable as it is attractive to say nothing unnecessary to instruct the mind and move the heart to be always eloquent in verse with the eloquence proper to each character represented to speak ones tongue with the same purity as in the most chastened prose without allowing the effort of rhyming to seem to hamper the thought to permit no single line to be hard or obscure or declamatory these are the conditions which nowadays one insists upon in a tragedy

8012088 investing in china is about picking the right segments of the economy and the companies that will make it for the long haul
8012089 our strategy for investing involves sticking to a handful of core strategic areas where weve picked a collection of stocks in key industries
8012090 the chinese economy is large amounting to approximately 3 6 trillion annually and its expanding at a rate of 10
8012091 industrial production the heart of the economy is gaining at a rate of 16 3 a year and is keeping a transforming labor force fully engaged unemployment is a scant 4 and retail sales are climbing at a hefty rate of more than 23
8012092 all of this comes at a price inflation is a biting 7 plus pollution is another economic stressor the major underpinnings of the chinese economy are still works in progress although theres a lot to be gained those gains never come in a straight line or without some challenges
8012093 our strategy for investing involves sticking to a handful of core strategic areas focused on energy environment infrastructure commodities and agriculture sectors
8012094 on the energy front oil is crucial to china this means china is helping to propel profits from producers worldwide offshore drilling in the south china sea is a no brainer which means
8012095 an increased need for cleaner water isnt just an issue in china but across the globe billions more dollars need to be invested with some 300 million chinese citizens clamoring for more clean water
8012096 while succumbing to the current market woes we continue to favor one of the worlds top leaders in water and water treatment businesses
8012097 commodities are the fuel for chinas growth were there on the raw side of that deal with the dbc which gives us direct participation in the values of all of commodities
8012098 and agricultural goods for food and alternative fuel remain a successful focus for us buy

8012124 this is a great way to buy a diversified portfolio of inflation adjusted treasuries and track them quite easily
8012125 the latest consumer price index figures were a bit of a shock the annual rate of inflation measured from last july to this july was 5 6 the largest annual gain since way back in january 1991
8012126 this report was especially noteworthy because it was double what economists were predicting 0
8012127 remember that the market is always looking forward not back investors are always more concerned with what lies ahead than what happened in the recent past
8012128 julys poor inflation report is already being trumped by lower oil prices a stronger dollar and a weakening u s economy all of these factors indicate that the jump in inflation may be short lived but thats right now next month or next year may be a different story entirely
8012129 thats why every investor should have a hedge in his portfolio like inflation adjusted treasuries
8012130 inflation protected securities are essentially treasury bonds that hedge against inflation you get an interest payment every six months just like with the old fashioned t note
8012131 but your principal increases each year by the amount of the consumer price index that means the amount youre paid in interest also increases by the amount of inflation
8012132 the interest you receive is exempt from state and local but not federal income taxes and like other treasuries your investment is backed by the full faith and credit of the u s government
8012133 you can get these bonds directly from the u s government or from virtually any broker but investors often tell me they have trouble buying them or even getting a price quote
8012134 the solution is the ishares lehman tips bond fund the fund attempts to replicate the return of the lehman brothers u s treasury inflation notes index it is easy to buy liquid and the expense ratio is small only two tenths of one percent
8012135 this is a great way to buy a diversified portfolio of inflation adjusted treasuries and track them quite easily
8012136 this fund is best owned in your ira or other qualified retirement plan however since the annual principal increase is treated as reportable income even though you dont receive it in cash
8012137 these are not likely to be the best performing holdings in your portfolio in the year ahead but if inflation ever comes back with a vengeance both stocks and bonds will take the news poorly and youll be glad you own them

8012140 everywhere else countries are moving to end this abhorrent practice but in iran the numbers of death sentences seem to be increasing
8012141 killing people for crimes committed as children provides neither justice nor safety for iranian society
8012142 the iranian authorities willingness to lie to lawyers and to deprive families of a last chance to see their loved ones only underscores the depravity of these executions

8012147 the bottom line is we dont have a job if we dont entertain

8012153 because of its focus on female empowerment young women are attracted by wicca popularised by the tv series buffy the vampire slayer
8012154 young women tend to express egalitarian values and dislike the traditionalism and hierarchies they imagine are integral to the church
8012155 womens ordination as priests and now bishops has dominated debate and headlines but while looking at women in the pulpit we have taken our eyes off the pews where a shift with more consequences for the churchs survival is underway
8012156 in my line of work you gotta keep repeating things over and over and over
8012157 its a beautiful building dont get me wrong but what we do is not about the building its about what we bring to the kids who come here
8012158 they got a school comparable to a college prep school for a general high school its a unique facility
8012159 basic life requires easy flow natural daylight a sense of playfulness about the environment and the ability to connect with other people
8012160 we talk to them about how privileged they are a lot of these kids already have baggage but i believe they all can be successful
8012161 at my last school id do my homework and people would hate me for it here its ok to be smart
8012162 i thought wow this is going to be really cool theres a lot of energy in here you cant fall asleep
8012163 we were able to convince school administrators that from a psychological standpoint a transparent school filled with natural daylight will improve security
8012164 its not necessarily about installing more cameras but about making the school pleasant
8012165 right now if you go out there the hallway is clear
8012166 there is pride the parents and kids feel good about it
8012167 we can foster a casual relationship between students and between students and teachers its more than just whats being taught in the classrooms its how that person becomes a human being in a democratic society
8012168 we looked at over twenty sites before locating the right building about a mile from our original school the search was a real challenge for nonprofessionals but luckily we had friends in newark real estate
8012169 the building had been through many incarnations since its original use as a chocolate factory and after the 1967 newark riots it was abandoned
8012170 to tear down a basically sound structure is a big waste of materials
8012171 though renovating an old existing building creates certain limitations the size and location of the old factory were ideal
8012172 at gensler we spend a lot of time with a client before we begin actual work on a project
8012173 and the process of eliminating buildings gave us a chance to dig in and understand what the expectations for the new school were
8012174 more than just making a sustainable building we wanted to create an environment in which the students are an integral part of the process and can learn from it
8012175 for instance on the roof of the gym we are putting in a garden with 2 feet of soil and some raised beds with 4 feet of soil the kids will grow some of the food that will be used in the cafeteria and theyll compost waste to return to the garden in a closed loop food cycle that project based study will be part of our teaching about nutrition wellness and health
8012176 for instance when we put in acoustical ceilings we placed them between the original wooden beams which we left unclad and rough similarly the glass lantern that brings natural light into the interior is pulled away from the brick face of the building so that its clearly an add on
8012177 after we moved in some of the construction was still going on so students could get a vivid idea of what the job of building entails
8012178 as an example those wooden beams will have signs that will discuss forests the timber industry sustainable logging even how wood has been used in construction through history
8012179 we are working with the science faculty on how various architectural elements could be used for life sciences
8012180 were planning for teachers and students to be able to use the signs in a kind of scavenger hunt to encourage them to put together a complete narrative piece by piece
8012181 its been a long run but theres a certain thrill to the whole process
8012182 for all of us just being in the building is uplifting if i could have written down the most hopeful scenario it wouldnt compare to the reality
8012183 in my line of work you gotta keep repeating things over and over and over

8012239 over the years i have been a part of the hurly burly of the british press and there has been plenty that has been said about me that has been rude and unsupportive i have never sought to pursue expressions of opinion however facts are facts and lies are lies and it seems to me that the law exists to allow people to clarify that
8012240 pioneered a new way of reconciling the right to freedom of speech with the right to reputation you nail the lie for all time with a court ordered declaration of falsity and you receive your legal costs but you decline to chill free speech by putting authors and publishers through an expensive trial and making them pay heavy damages
8012241 she was trying to get to school but she missed the bus
8012242 the three babies were there on the floor with the filth all around
8012243 it was just pitiful they really didnt know what was going on
8012244 the first thing we did was get them out of those dirty diapers
8012245 we gave them a bath and put some clothes on them
8012246 he told me his wife was supposed to be taking care of the kids
8012247 he the father said i think its my fault i didnt do anything about it
8012248 the story you are about to see is true the names have been changed to protect the innocent
8012249 what do we care if we were expelled from college scarlett the war is going to start any day now so wed have left college anyhow
8012250 hardly surprising but just more confirmation of the very difficult times faced by the housebuilders
8012251 in the light of difficult trading conditions the board considers this reduction to be a prudent action to take
8012252 it is good for cashflow but they offer much lower profit margins
8012253 we are very happy that dawn airey will start at the end of october working for five and she will make a difference
8012254 the programme budget for five has increased this year regarding next year please understand that i will want to give dawn the answer she will have the programme budget she needs to be successful
8012255 more banks will come on the list as credit problems worsen
8012256 by any yardstick it was another tough quarter we continue to strongly encourage banks and institutions to ensure they have enough reserves to cover losses
8012257 the overwhelming majority of banks 98 of them continue to be well capitalised by regulatory standards
8012258 we believe institutions can and will step up to the plate to provide whatever insurance funds are needed
8012259 well have to see how much the ligaments are damaged whether they are torn

8012266 cuando me dijo mi entrenador que hab a entrado en el cuadro final no lo cre a me entr la risa porque ya estaba con la mente puesta en irme
8012267 en el primer set sal muy nerviosa porque era mi primer partido en un cuadro principal de un grande y ella me presion mucho luego pens que me ten a que soltar que no ten a nada que perder y empec a jugar bien
8012268 aunque tuve la fortuna de sin jugar tambi n pude ganar y pasar de ronda
8012269 ser un partido muy duro porque ella es muy buena y suma experiencia a pesar de que tiene la misma edad que yo pero tiene un gran juego agresivo y variado y ser muy complicado
8012270 according to the suspects statements so far there is a strong suspicion that roni and marie are involved in violent abuse and the murder of rose
8012271 he confessed to investigators and reconstructed the events of that tragic night when he gave the child a blow a blow he did not expect to have such a result
8012272 he was under pressure panicked was very worried about his partners likely reaction and as a result took action to conceal the body
8012273 we need a president who will work hard for us
8012274 i have found my viewpoint on most issues is in line with the majority of the people in my district
8012275 kate does not know the plaintiffs and has never met with them or spoken with them
8012276 it speaks well for our institutions consciousness in preventing an otherwise needless waste
8012277 whenever theres a bunch of people here at one time it gets crazy you have people bumping into you so if youre balancing stuff youre going to end up dropping something or breaking something
8012278 so if a college is looking to go green they need to start looking in the dining facility
8012279 its going faster in some places than others because you have different cultures and different ways that universities do things
8012280 when the numbers were high i would get stopped in the street maybe once a week
8012281 now that the viewing figures are lower on the tv everywhere i go someone will come up to me and say what a huge fan they are that just tells me that people watch the show in a more modern way and that it has reached its sort of critical mass
8012282 tivo had just sort of taken off this was four or five seasons ago and because we were on friday nights most people most fans dont watch it on first run they tivo it and watch it a zillion times
8012283 its really about big business the machinations and the subterfuge that go on inside of it when you have something that is groundbreaking and could change the nature of life and the future
8012284 if opportunity were driving with only five wheels like spirit it probably would never get out of victoria crater
8012285 we also know from experience with spirit that if opportunity were to lose the use of a wheel after it is out on the level ground mobility should not be a problem
8012286 the patterns broadly resemble what we saw at the smaller craters opportunity explored earlier
8012287 by looking deeper into the layering we are looking farther back in time
8012288 weve done everything we entered victoria crater to do and more
8012289 no era una tarea f cil pero nos pusimos a ello
8012290 realizamos hasta ocho evoluciones de la primera versi n resultaba fiable y daba resultados satisfactorios pero quer amos m s

8012292 hemos tenido una buena temporada y los corredores est extremadamente motivados para terminarla bien tenemos ciclistas para las etapas de monta a y para las llanas adem s de tener la experiencia de grandes campeones como contador kloden o leipheimer
8012293 me he preparado mejor que para el giro de italia tanto mental como t cnicamente
8012294 me llam el seleccionador paco antequera y me dijo que iba a incluirme en la primera lista cuando he visto mi nombre en ella me he llevado una gran alegr a
8012295 fue en zolder en 2002 y ha llovido desde entonces
8012296 la verdad es que me encuentro muy bien tanto f sica como mentalmente en plouay llegu a sentirme vencedor de la carrera cuando a falta de tres vueltas ya en el km 190 de carrera me vi solo en cabeza pero la reacci n por atr s fue muy violenta aun as pude ayudar a david l pez en la ltima vuelta
8012297 el viernes empezamos en alemania y voy con muchas ganas el a o pasado termin vig simo primero y quiero mejorar esa clasificaci n
8012298 en el equipo estar n nuestros mejores corredores ya que nos gustar a obtener este a o las mismas satisfacciones que tuvimos el a o pasado cuando ganamos 3 etapas ballan cunego bruseghin y napolitano son de calidad garantizada y contar n con el apoyo de marzano mori y tiralongo mientras que santambrogio y bindi tratar n de sacar partido a su combatividad
8012299 we believe that jesus christ is the only real hope for the world if you would like to discuss jesus feel free to contact one of us there is salvation in no other name under heaven given among mortals by which we must be saved
8012300 its very humbling for a dad in front of his kids to be told hes contravened federal legislation and impacted an endangered species
8012301 we get calls saying things like theres a big orange boat thats too close to the whales when we get those reports we give them a cursory review because its not enough to go on
8012302 so far we have seen pretty good compliance and weve only given one citation weve given warnings to several other individuals but were taking a slow approach
8012303 ninety some per cent of operators are responsible but theres always a few individuals that you spend most of the time with
8012304 as theyre watching the whales the commercial vessel plowed right through
8012305 his explanation was that in his home of origin there are stories of whales capsizing boats
8012306 im quite pleased that this incident went to court and a conviction was handed down
8012307 dfo has put a lot of effort forward with species at risk to identify threats and mitigate those incidents
8012308 we wouldnt have known about it if the people didnt come forward
8012309 spanair said the mechanic dealt with a problem in an air temperature gauge that forced the pilot to abandon a first attempt to take off about an hour later when the md 82 finally did take off it crashed near the end of the runway burning and largely disintegrating a total of 153 of the 172 people aboard were killed police and investigators probing the deadly plane crash in madrid have questioned the mechanic who cleared the plane for takeoff the newspaper el pais quoted unnamed sources close to the investigation as saying that during two sessions of testimony friday first with police and then with crash investigators the mechanic insisted that the gauge malfunction was a minor glitch which had nothing to do with wednesdays crash aviation experts have said this problem probably did not cause the crash spanair said the mechanic dealt with the gauge problem by essentially turning the device off and said this was an accepted procedure because the gauge was not an absolutely essential piece of equipment but the head of spanish civil aviation manuel bautista told the ap in an interview friday that the gauge should be closely examined to see if it did contribute to the accident bautista said a combination of failures likely caused the disaster relatives of people who died in the crash met friday night with spanair representatives and complained angrily that the company was not providing any information on what might have caused the crash some said their loved ones had sent them cell phone text messages saying that had tried to get off the plane after the mechanical problem emerged but were not allowed to spanair declined to comment on the issue saturday
8012310 57 incidents including 24 hull loss accidents with 1 176 fatalities
8012311 people say they like me people tell me they think id be a good president but that they just dont think i can win
8012312 the flood of foreclosures in massachusetts is not only continuing it has reached a new high
8012313 the fact we are starting the year with the highest number of foreclosures weve ever recorded for a single month is more than significant its ominous
8012314 private property rights deferred has predatory mortgage servicing destroyed the american dream

8012317 we believe that the street has overreacted to the headline of mortality associated with pancreatitis as our analysis suggests that the severity and mortality rate reported with byetta pancreatitis cases is not significantly increased relative to the overall aers patient database
8012318 in this profoundly human autobiography she responds to the multiple lies half truths and speculation that has been written about her over the course of the last few months
8012319 conducting an internal assessment but no decision has been made
8012320 this is an excellent price given that the oil price has come off stockmarkets are in a mess and the whole situation in russia is changing
8012321 highly unlikely given the terms of the bid its as done a deal as you can imagine
8012322 we view this as an important opportunity to expand on the continuing cooperation between russia and india in the energy sector
8012323 the monthly numbers of approvals for house purchase which have fallen by some two thirds over the last year levelled off in july it would however be premature to think that the housing market will now start to recover because overall approval activity continues to be very low
8012324 mortgage activity appears to be stabilising although the paltry level of activity is not supportive of a near term pick up in house prices
8012325 few crumbs of comfort can be taken from recent signs that mortgage activity may have finally found a floor amid a backdrop of a stalling economy and expected rises in unemployment
8012326 the shortage of mortgage funding has limited activity across the mortgage market including the buy to let sector which has a significant number of lenders that rely on wholesale funding
8012327 these figures show the extent of uncertainty in the housing market which alistair darling made worse by sending out confused signals over a stamp duty holiday
8012328 many people are putting their lives on hold as a result of labours economic incompetence the chancellor should adopt the conservatives plan to abolish stamp duty for nine out of 10 first time buyers
8012329 the pressures on household budgets are reflected in the relatively weak rise in individuals deposits and with consumer borrowing growing only slowly it seems that consumers are acting prudently
8012330 the current difficult trading environment will continue for the foreseeable future
8012331 its time for a change to give the british public a time keeping service that is current modern and useful
8012332 kate does not know the plaintiffs and has never met with them or spoken with them
8012333 twenty years have passed since julies murder investigations have come close to her killer however more information is needed
8012334 something might well turn up and i also wanted to show people that im still on the case at the least the person responsible for julies murder would have got cold shivers when they opened the newspaper this morning
8012335 the dup is impatient with the foot dragging on ending the ira army council and wants to see a greater flow of information to the police about those who were nurtured by the ira but who now continue attacks under different labels the move to democracy is an ongoing commitment and a continuing journey it is not a move of convenience or a tactical step
8012336 a meeting of the executive has been scheduled for september 18 if this meeting were not to take place it is self evident that there would be serious consequences for the good government of northern ireland and indeed potentially for those who refuse to fulfil their legal obligations
8012337 we have agreements in terms of justice and policing in terms of the irish language act and so on and we want those delivered on its not a case of threatening anything its just a case of recommitting ourselves to actually delivering
8012338 they are an extra pair of eyes and ears and if tasked properly they will get results because unlike police officers who can get diverted they are usually on the street for seven hours engaging with the community
8012339 its disappointing that each year we see a small minority of mainly young men who dont come to the carnival until later
8012340 they dont come to enjoy the floats and the music they come to fight and commit acts of violence we have seen serious incidents in previous years
8012341 for two hours our officers came under attack from bottles bricks and any debris that was on the ground these were officers who had been working hard all day
8012342 our first priority must be the safety of the public
8012343 we suggest strictly enforced government mandated daily dose limits for toxic metals in all dietary supplements and requirements that all manufacturers demonstrate compliance through independent third party testing
8012344 a thousand years ago it was thought that through heating lead was made non toxic which is clearly not the case these traditions live on and they carry on endangering our health
8012345 the work was the usual ranch hands luck hard dirty long and dull there was no time for anything but saddle up ride rope cut herd unsaddle eat sleep and do it again
8012346 its year round snow cover was gone and the peak stood obscenely bare a pale grey summit quivering in rock that had not seen sunlight in hundreds of years lay exposed another hot dry summer the sky filling with wind torn clouds and lightning but no rain occasionally a few drops rattled the air before the clouds dragged them away
8012347 h e or she would find combined features of the worlds worst air terminals hongqiao in shanghai the ideal
8012348 complete with petty officials sadomasochistic staffers consecutive security checks of increasing harshness rapidly fluctuating gate changes and departure times and finally a 27 hour trip in an antiquated and overcrowded bucket flying through typhoons while rivets popped against the fuselage
8012349 with climate change and globalisation the ageing of the population is one of the major challenges europe must face
8012350 from 2015 onwards deaths would outnumber births and population growth due to natural increase would cease
8012351 positive net migration would be the only population growth factor however from 2035 this positive net migration would no longer counterbalance the negative natural change
8012352 we believe mohammed was trying to get away from the situation when he fell and hit his head on the pavement sustaining serious injuries
8012353 we are now trying to establish how he came to fall and hit his head in this way was he assaulted punched or pushed
8012354 this is a murder inquiry and we are seeking to establish to what extent race played a part in what happened
8012355 a police patrol car did stop at the kebab shop earlier in the evening and officers spoke to the owner but no crimes were being committed at that time
8012356 there were officers on the scene almost immediately after the trouble started as this is a highly patrolled area
8012357 i asked them to leave then noticed a police car pull up outside so i went over and spoke to the officers i asked them to keep an eye on the boys and they said they would then left
8012358 mohammed was a young student who was loved by his family friends and teachers he was a charming loving boy and there is nothing that can replace our loss all of those involved in committing this crime should be punished for this crime on a young innocent 16 year old boy
8012359 i am certainly not going to get into a pissing competition with the bourne fans you have the monarchy you have government and then you have the civil service the reason the civil service remains a non political organisation is that if the shit hits the fan like goose stepping nazi bastards you hope the civil service will turn around and go weve got it covered thats bond
8012360 we make family adventure films sadism for the entire family we always need to bear in mind that it is a family tradition
8012361 there will be european chauvinism judge corruption buying of brawn and brains and a strong dose of racism
8012362 let us hope that at the 2012 olympics britain is portrayed in a more recognisable way and that
8012363 i would say some people thought we were going to die
8012364 i knew it wasnt an engine problem there was a sudden drop in temperature and a rush of cold air you think to yourself god is there a hole in the aircraft it actually felt like someone had opened a door at the back of the aircraft it was incredibly cold the next thing the oxygen masks were dropping
8012365 i sent my mum a text i love you and i am going down
8012366 for about half an hour no one told us anything we didnt know what was happening at all we were quite panicky
8012367 after half an hour we were told to take the oxygen mask off and then the plane landed and we were fine
8012368 we have to require that the pilots and the cabin crew deploy their oxygen masks and they cant be making pa announcements while they have their oxygen masks on
8012369 one thing that can happen is that the outflow valve can fail and become open so all the air rushes out
8012370 a hole can appear because some damage was done which nobody notices and because of the constant stress of pressurising and depressurising the cabin it becomes bigger over time
8012371 what we had in these cases was jet jockeys deciding i am better than ryanair sops standard operating procedures we dont want anybody doing that
8012372 it has the youngest fleet of aircraft in europe and their maintenance organisation is first class
8012373 an increasing trend is bringing cocaine by aircraft instead of by boat into west africa then it is taken on by land or ship to europe across some dangerous and difficult terrain
8012374 we are forcing criminals to raise their risk factors by turning up the heat and forcing them out of their comfort zones
8012375 its too early to tell how much cocaine is arriving but it is not a small amount
8012376 corruption has always been in the back of our minds in difficult operating environments such as africa it is a challenge to find partners who we can trust but we are making headway
8012377 it appears that additional enforcement efforts have had little adverse effect on the availability of illicit drugs in the uk
8012378 since 2000 average street prices in the uk have fallen consistently for heroin cocaine ecstasy and cannabis
8012379 there is some evidence to suggest that a two tier market for powder cocaine has emerged in the uk during recent years at both wholesale and street levels these data suggest that there is now an expanding market for cheaper heavily adulterated cocaine among young people and students for example and that higher purity cocaine is aimed at more affluent buyers
8012380 over the past 10 years cocaine has become increasingly available in the uk while it still retains its glamour image prices have fallen and put the drug within the reach of a wide range of people for whom cocaine has become an unremarkable part of their lifestyle
8012381 it seems as if this process began with the break up of the large cocaine cartels in colombia during the early 1990s resulting in the development of several smaller cartels who needed to find new outlets beyond the traditional us market
8012382 this is the same gang there are an awful lot of connections between the two
8012383 the plane tickets were booked at the same north london travel agents and by a man using the same name and with the same credit card
8012384 this gang circles around potential couriers sizing them up these three girls could be the tip of the iceberg
8012385 although plane tickets have been bought inoculations organised and hotel accommodation in west africa arranged the three mules were only asked to return with a package because they do not explicitly mention class a drugs the authorities are finding it difficult to prove a conspiracy
8012386 they buy them things and offer them holidays hairdos clothes and nights out what girl wouldnt want that
8012387 but theres a price theres always a price to pay these people can send 10 girls out there at a cost of 20 000 if one gets through they make more than 100 000 profit
8012388 he took her to another hotel where he was staying and said to her if you want to get back to england you will be taking this weed with you and youll get 1 000 that was the only way she was going to get back he told her
8012389 we were given one minute together before the hearing separated by a perspex screen we were both crying our hearts out she kept saying im sorry dad im so sorry dad
8012390 carly was sobbing and shaking uncontrollably i felt so helpless sat the other side of the glass that was the last time i saw her
8012391 jamie and i have done the research and figured that the only way to end the debate about the myth of the apollo moon landing is to go there
8012392 we built a hybrid rocket that was fueled by poo and nitrous oxide thought we had enough teflon tape on the seals but the stink got through anyway too bad that the footage got lost in transit to the editors
8012393 we looked at the ones that for some reason or other seemed most prevalent
8012394 the key idea was that the footage that proved we were there was a special effect adam and i are experienced effects artists so it was natural for us to dig into it
8012395 we wanted to tackle the ones that actually take some experimentation to prove
8012396 i was actually first involved with the mythbusters early on when i was contacted by one of their producers asking if i had any astronomical myths for them to bust
8012397 an astronomer who worked with the hubble telescope plait created a website
8012398 i made some suggestions but sadly they didnt use any of them
8012399 i guess most of them dont make very good tv
8012400 i hadnt heard anything about this show so i fired off an e mail to adam savage and said what gives
8012401 over the course of a few days they were on the phone with me and a lot of other people who knew about for example the properties of the lunar surface to try to figure out not just the best way of debunking the moon hoax but the best aspects of it so they wanted to know which ones that they had found were the ones that i ran into and what were the best ways to tackle them it was actually a lot of fun
8012402 enrico fermi was the first person to suggest how cosmic particles could be accelerated to high speeds
8012403 his theory provides the foundation for understanding the powerful phenomena his namesake telescope will discover
8012404 we did this map in a very brief period of time just in a matter of days
8012405 the previous experiment egret nasas energetic gamma ray experiment telescope took more than a year to make an equivalent map that holds a tremendous amount of promise for things to come
8012406 none of us could have actually have asked for such a smooth turn on it went like clockwork where we were actually ahead of the clock
8012407 theres been a little bit of bad luck the bursts havent been cooperating with us
8012408 theres no doubt were gonna get some good ones its just a matter of waiting
8012409 no est dividido ni fraccionado ahora m s que nunca estamos unidos en la defensa de nuestros intereses como trabajadores

8012413 sicuramente sar positivo per le altre squadre che potranno vederci visto che giocheremo il venerd siamo contenti perch questo ci leva un po di ansia siamo comunque ancora in attesa che la lega risolva la questione dei diritti televisivi
8012414 s la stanno sottovalutando molto perch la serie b c certo la a unaltra cosa ma anche la serie cadetta ha parecchi giocatori importanti e poi sono calciatori che la rendono molto pi spettacolare rispetto allanno scorso ci sono molti pi fantasisti
8012415 gli obiettivi il parma una societ ambiziosa e vuole tornare subito in serie a
8012416 sono dei vagabondi figurati giocano sempre bene dovunque siano danno ovunque tanto e sono contenti di stare insieme
8012417 bella non potr mai dimenticarla spero che il genoa faccia un buon campionato questanno
8012418 s perch con la qualit che avevamo non dovevamo sottovalutarci abbiamo fatto un ottimo campionato questanno i rossobl potrebbero andare in uefa anche se gi lanno scorso si poteva fare ma il volere del presidente era un altro
8012419 e interessante molto pi spettacolare questanno ci sono delle piazze che si esaltano molto inter davanti a tutte poi roma fiorentina e milan la juventus no
8012420 cynthia mckinney deserves a place in the new orleans debate any presidential candidate who has qualified for enough ballot lines to achieve the necessary electoral votes to win to be elected regardless of poll numbers has earned a place in the debates the 15 threshold is being used to exclude all candidates outside of the corporate party nominees john mccain and barack obama
8012421 ms mckinney is more than just the candidate of a viable and growing party she has played a special role in the movement to help survivors of the 2005 hurricane disaster in new orleans and the gulf coast region no other presidential candidate can talk about the needs of those whove been displaced or otherwise affected by katrina the way ms mckinney can their concerns will be missing from the debate if cynthia mckinney isnt invited
8012422 voters deserve to know about all the names theyll see on the ballot on election day and to know which candidate best represents ones interests and ideals its time to end debates limited to candidates approved by sponsoring corporations and pollsters
8012423 used when an object of discussion normally a person unexpectedly becomes present during the conversation
8012424 give to those who ask and dont turn away from those who want to borrow
8012425 what exciting piece of plastic will be on your butt this week stephen
8012426 for i was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat i was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink i was a stranger and you did not invite me in i needed clothes and you did not clothe me i was sick and in prison and you did not look after me
8012427 when i broke up with my husband last summer we decided to sell the house to split the equity and pay for the divorce
8012428 but despite dropping the price twice we still havent sold so were stuck in a situation where were still not divorced and although we try to maintain a reasonable front with each other in front of our six year old daughter underneath its very strained and there have been times when she has seen things she shouldnt have the emotional impact is massive and sometimes i feel like tearing my hair out my only saving grace is that since ive started telling people about it ive realised how common it is
8012429 what the little research out there does tell us is that people often have unspoken goals about money that they dont share even with each other
8012430 in times of economic boom they just get on with it but in times of uncertainty resentment can kick in well if you hadnt insisted on having this house or bought your 17th pair of shoes we wouldnt be in this situation oh and i suppose your top of the range satnav has nothing to do with us heading for debt and so on
8012431 money is one of the primary reasons or causes of a divorce and when you have a downward economy that exacerbates the financial troubles and tensions in marriage
8012432 were in a situation where creative problem solving is at an absolute premium in terms of choosing a divorce attorney
8012433 in a time of declining property values you do get cases where neither party wants to resolve matters until values of property have ceased falling
8012434 they simply subdivided their house into properties so the wife and children effectively occupied two thirds and the husband one third
8012435 my studio is in the home so moving out wasnt an option for me but i couldnt afford to buy him out of the mortgage right away the problem was he couldnt afford to move out until id done that so we were stuck thankfully we had a spare room
8012436 once you make the decision to separate you want to start your new life it stopped me dating and i didnt feel i could socialise at home then there were the little things such as washing and ironing do you get petty and say im not doing yours even though its in the basket do you say im only cooking my dinner not yours i didnt feel comfortable with that so we were still living much of our lives like a couple
8012437 its not that we werent civil to each other we have two children aged eight and five and were very mindful of them and still did some things with them together but my wife went off with someone else and that was hard the house is still on the market despite us dropping the price by 10 000 at a time i wonder when its ever going to end
8012438 i dealt with a guy who lived with his wife for a year while they waited to sell up shed left him but he still loved her
8012439 in the end he started doing things such as removing her food from the fridge and hiding her hair straighteners it doesnt sound much but imagine it all the time
8012440 those in council accommodation wouldnt be touched by a house sale and those at the top end still seem to be saying what spending problems despite the credit crunch
8012441 its the middle bracket where the primary asset is the house who are suffering they may well have stretched themselves for 15 or more years
8012442 despite splitting up with my boyfriend a month ago were having to live together until september in a rented one bedroom apartment where sleeping on the couch isnt even really an option for any length of time because its a two seater
8012443 its hideous but at 1 500 per month for a pretty standard flat in clapham south london theres no way one of us can move out because the other wouldnt be able to meet the bills thankfully there are nights when im able to stay away and sometimes he works overseas but there are times we have to share the bed with pillows down the middle
8012444 my partner and i separated before christmas but the house hasnt sold and its really stressful
8012445 i think the worst thing is that the children know were separated our families know and our friends know but were still here in this limbo state a couple of days ago the estate agent said we should drop the price again this time by 25 000 my partner says no way but part of me feels our situation is so desperate that maybe we should just do it so that we can get a buyer and move on with our lives
8012446 if youre a wife with a low income capacity and youre told your house has to be sold and that because your house is worth less than you thought you have to move into accommodation that you would never have dreamed about living in defending the divorce is one way to put a hold on everything the husband on the other hand may be keen to get divorced now because he is worth far less than he was six to 12 months ago which means the payout to his wife is far less than it would have been
8012447 ive seen clients recently where they weigh up the pros and cons and theyve agreed with their partner that splitting up is actually not worth it
8012448 va a haber una amplia participaci n porque el abuso es contra todos los trabajadores y es la misma matr cula la que nos est pidiendo que actuemos

8012450 the offer on the table is still short of what we would consider full value for rio tinto and its prospects and these results emphasise that
8012451 we are demonstrating what rio tinto is really capable of
8012452 there is no question that we are living in an era of unprecedented demand for minerals and metals
8012453 the fallout of the credit crisis will continue to dampen the global economy over the next 24 months with sharply escalated oil and food prices beginning to test inflation expectations
8012454 this may impact temaseks ability to divest its stake in various entities and manage its portfolio
8012455 why shouldnt we quarrel about a word what is the good of words if they arent important enough to quarrel over why do we choose one word more than another if there isnt any difference between them

8012460 o arquitecto lvaro siza vieira revelou hoje que est a elaborar a ltima etapa do plano de reconstru o do chiado 20 anos depois do inc ndio que destruiu a zona projectando uma nova liga o pedonal a pedido da autarquia
8012461 that babys life is destroyed and it could have been avoided thats just wrong
8012462 it seems to me to be unconvincing that a huge large amount of money will improve your reputation it just means that your lawyers are better than the other persons lawyers but to have the court stating that certain things are untrue seems to me to be emphatic
8012463 over the years i have been a part of the hurly burly of the british press and there has been plenty that has been said about me that has been rude and unsupportive i have never sought to pursue expressions of opinion however facts are facts and lies are lies and it seems to me that the law exists to allow people to clarify that
8012464 pioneered a new way of reconciling the right to freedom of speech with the right to reputation you nail the lie for all time with a court ordered declaration of falsity and you receive your legal costs but you decline to chill free speech by putting authors and publishers through an expensive trial and making them pay heavy damages
8012465 because its so hard to answer i have many interests and i like keeping busy and working on several projects at the same time right now im developing an arts centre i dont see myself as a person who just does one thing i understand that sometimes that might sound a bit unprofessional but i disagree
8012466 it is a bunch of things i like to create to do something new something that does not have a predictable outcome i love art and this project excites me and it has an incredible potential to be immensely challenging and satisfying of course everyone wants to make a difference and help people or provide things they would be happy to see
8012467 i have had an interest in art since childhood i loved to draw as a child and still do though
8012468 i wont pretend to be the biggest connoisseur of the contemporary artists of today
8012469 sometimes you see photographers in places you would not expect but overall it is pretty calm
8012470 when youre 10 you dont realise its difficult its an adventure when youre in a situation that is foreign to you you just have to pull yourself together and adapt
8012471 you dont buy that kind of thing unless you really want to show off what a big collector you are
8012472 i have never been a collector i have a few pieces that i got for my birthdays or that i bought for myself i acquire things that speak to me and put them on my wall when i see things i like i just know
8012473 the first priority is not when will there be a first women president of russia but when the president will be someone not chosen by the oligarchs and the vlast the powers that be
8012474 i definitely feel russian i feel russian but at the same time when im in the states i feel at home too i dont know if this is a patriotic gesture or just a lucky coincidence
8012475 i just saw the building and thought what a great place nothing ever turns out the way you plan it or imagine it
8012476 people will come and see the space because of abramovichs name he buys significant art works giving a sense of assurance to those who are not yet sure whether its worth collecting contemporary art and garage has an opportunity to become moscows tate modern it will be for tourists art professionals and just for ordinary people who want to know more about the taste of the wealthiest man in russia
8012477 dashas reputation is controversial people who know her adore her those who were accidentally not invited to the garage private opening already started hating her
8012478 they are afraid of it the level of appreciation is just not there and the government does not support contemporary art
8012479 dasha is very intelligent and she educates herself very quickly about everything to do with the art world i think she will be able to bring this to a new audience here its certainly one of the most original spaces in moscow
8012480 it will be very upsetting and distasteful if its all just a game lets all go and live in london lets all collect art now to develop this kind of project you need a big plan and i hope they have one if theyre just playing at contemporary art the sooner its over the better but if this is their lifes work then it merits respect if its serious then its worthy to develop something like this in moscow requires a lot of energy and huge material investment because russian art deserves this kind of legacy
8012481 dashas reputation in the art world is not yet well established
8012482 as people tend to think she is like a moth that flies to the light to strengthen the russian side of her character she would need to make more friends in moscow just to become native which is quite realistic given her russian childhood people talk of her as an exotic fruit from overseas
8012483 i had the opportunity to do deals with a number of record labels but im confident about my music and the future of bandstocks which seems to be a much more honest and transparent way to release records
8012484 for the first time in my adult lifetime i am really proud of my country and not just because barack has done well but because i think people are hungry for change
8012485 because we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
8012486 the military families who say grace each night with an empty seat at the table the servicemen and women who love this country so much they leave those they love most to defend it
8012487 its what hes done in the united states senate fighting to ensure the men and women who serve this country are welcomed home not just with medals and parades but with good jobs and benefits and health care including mental health care
8012488 surely its safe now to apply because they are no longer hiring
8012489 frank is endowed with a god given raw vision that sees things in the urban experience that others dont it is his madcap perception that drives us to challenge conventional thinking and promote collaborative community building ultimately frank is about fostering shared neighborhood vision for healing and revitalization

8012563 lucentis is an expensive drug costing more than 10 000 for each eye treated but that cost needs to be balanced against the likely cost savings age related macular degeneration results in reduced quality of life and increased risks of illness particularly in relation to accidents especially falls and psychological ill health
8012564 it has been estimated that the costs related to sight impairment for patients treated with lucentis are around 8 000 cheaper than for patients who receive best supportive care over a 10 year period
8012565 nices guidance will finally bring an end to a cruel postcode lottery
8012566 there is now nowhere left for pcts to hide we want them to implement nice guidance immediately rnib is also calling on hospitals to ensure they build capacity as a matter of urgency so they can save the sight of patients without further delay
8012567 at present we cannot detect differences in effects or risks although avastin may require fewer injections as it appears to last longer after each injection so the taxpayer may wish to question why they are paying so much more for lucentis when avastin appears to achieve the same outcome

8012589 this gentleman hit the stand and was promptly dragged off by his parachute landing on the track in front of the main stand to say the ground went quiet was an understatement
8012590 the worst bit apart from watching a man fall approximately the height of two houses was that there were six other parachutists behind him and the man on the pa system was shouting for them to land elsewhere as villa park is surrounded by terraced houses and the m6 they had little choice but to land on the pitch parachutist no2 had seen his mate hit the one stand and in avoiding that missed the opposite stand by inches as everyone in the stadium held their breath the other five landed in goals on corner flags and anywhere but the cross in the middle of the pitch
8012591 lillestr m sk needed to beat troms at home while rosenborg had to lose points away at brann for lillestr m to take the title
8012592 at half time nothing was decided lillestr m were doing their job leading troms 2 0 while rosenborg were leading 2 1 in bergen
8012593 but during the half time break a parachutist who was supposed to land on the field instead hit the roof of the stands punching a hole and this caused a half hour delay to the start of the second half while the fire brigade came to the rescue by the time the second half started rosenborg were leading 4 1 in bergen and had secured their 10th successive league title
8012594 after seeing southampton defender michael svenssons almost fairytale return to action after nearly three years out with injury
8012595 i was wondering what the longest time out injury period is that a player has endured before returning to the first team of a football club
8012596 i reckon marc overmars recent return to a dutch second division side must be an example of the longest time out of football before returning
8012597 i would guess the longest time out of the first team would be those players who careers spanned either side of the second world war
8012598 from september 1939 till the resumption of fa cup matches in the 1945 46 season or even longer if their demob was held up until 1947

8012605 since paul jewells appointment as derby manager on 28 november 2007 he has yet to win a match in 28 attempts in the league
8012606 what is the longest period of time since being appointed that a manager has kept his job without overseeing a league win for his team
8012607 having read that graeme souness once sold a young deco id like to know which manager or club is most culpable for letting future superstars slip through their fingers without their coach even recognising their talent

8012617 sometimes you need the kick up the backside similar to the one we had against liege
8012618 you dont want to go into the season a little bit complacent and no one could argue against the fact liege were the better team on the night
8012619 it was certainly a wake up call for us and the best thing about it was that we didnt get beat
8012620 were still in the tie and know that at anfield we will play a lot better liege will also find it more difficult
8012621 we have to improve at everything set pieces and open play
8012622 the best thing was the result but this time we have to play better and we have to score goals
8012623 standard could be the best team weve faced in qualifiers
8012624 but if we do the right things we can be on top of them at anfield
8012625 we will try to play at a high tempo and im sure theyll try to play on the counter attack
8012626 i think it will be more or less similar to the first game but the difference will be anfield
8012627 if you ask me if i am considering this option the answer is no i am just thinking about winning

8012649 these studies show that moderate 20 30 percent ethanol blends can reduce air pollution improve gas mileage and save drivers money in the most popular cars on the road today

8012652 twenty years from now our nations transportation fuels sector will be powered primarily by domestically produced biofuels if we have the vision and the will to make that happen
8012653 just as we sent a man to the moon we can harness our technological skills and entrepreneurial spirit to end our dangerous reliance on foreign sources of oil in doing so we will not only protect our national security we will also protect our public health create quality jobs for the next generations and keep billions of dollars here at home rather than sending them to nations that want to do us harm

8012655 sigmund freud made a great contribution to psychoanalysis with his concept of the super ego which was referenced as primitive and unconscious aggregate of values and psychoanalysis in form by contemporary authors
8012656 therefore psychoanalysis also questions traditional ideas of irrationality it shows that human tastes preferences and other apparently irrational psychological consumers marketing decisions have a meaning and it is rational even though most theorists argue that there is continuity between rationality and irrationality this remained controversial among scholars
8012657 of course this is another issue of major research topic in marketing even the most apparently abnormal and irrational buying behaviors are meaningful because they occur for a reason and in that sense they are rational
8012658 even though damasios application is strictly scientific but the conceptual adoption to consumer behaviour attitudes values and actions is practical
8012659 before now the influence of emotions on consumers decision making buying decision is largely ignored
8012660 since the term emotion tends to mean different things to the man and woman on the street layman the psychologist the physiologist and the marketer have used the term somatic to refer to the collection of mentally related responses that hallmark an emotion consumer behaviour even though somatic refers to the greek word soma i e body
8012661 sigmund freuds treatment of peoples desires wishes and human feelings is extensively discussed in literature freud 1954 these too must be understood as rational in terms of buying behavior no matter of the racial identity all consumers suffer from degree of anxiety provoked by the buying decisions and massive product assortments
8012662 if theres one thing you can count on about the centennial conference its the final standings will reflect how competitive the league is five different teams have captured at least a share of the centennial league championship over the past four seasons

8012665 the monthly numbers of approvals for house purchase which have fallen by some two thirds over the last year levelled off in july it would however be premature to think that the housing market will now start to recover because overall approval activity continues to be very low
8012666 mortgage activity appears to be stabilising although the paltry level of activity is not supportive of a near term pick up in house prices
8012667 few crumbs of comfort can be taken from recent signs that mortgage activity may have finally found a floor amid a backdrop of a stalling economy and expected rises in unemployment
8012668 the shortage of mortgage funding has limited activity across the mortgage market including the buy to let sector which has a significant number of lenders that rely on wholesale funding
8012669 these figures show the extent of uncertainty in the housing market which alistair darling made worse by sending out confused signals over a stamp duty holiday
8012670 many people are putting their lives on hold as a result of labours economic incompetence the chancellor should adopt the conservatives plan to abolish stamp duty for nine out of 10 first time buyers
8012671 the pressures on household budgets are reflected in the relatively weak rise in individuals deposits and with consumer borrowing growing only slowly it seems that consumers are acting prudently

8012683 we will not sign any player to replace palermo viatri has already proved how valuable he is as a football player and well bet on youngsters
8012684 we dont need to bring in any new player because we have viatri ricardo noir and the rest of the guys who can play very well
8012685 giving space to young players is the policy of this club we also have some older players such as lucas castroman or leandro gracian who are also a part of the squad so well wait for palermos return with the players we currently have
8012686 coming in this way is quite ugly because nobody wishes an injury to a team mate
8012687 if i have the chance to play i will do my best as i always do if i can score it would be great
8012688 if he can more or less perform for us as he did two or three years ago hell be a great help
8012689 we were not good on saturday and we lost the game it is as simple as that
8012690 you cannot want the supporters not to take it to heart because we do we are all very disappointed with our performance
8012691 we completely understand the critics because we were not good but we promise we will come back and play well tomorrow to put a good performance in
8012692 we did not play well as a team everybody knows that and william is no more guilty than anybody else
8012693 we lost as a team and we want to respond as a team
8012694 we have talked about everything needed to be successful in a team and commitment is needed for any success no matter how much quality you have
8012695 we live in world now where you have to accept the critics and a definite conclusion from everybody
8012696 but i know my squad is good my team is good our spirit is good
8012697 we are intelligent enough to know we did not play well on saturday but we know as well we have the needed quality to respond
8012698 i believe we have a strong squad and i believe in the players i have instead of always looking at who might be coming in
8012699 it is up to us as team to show personality strength and belief within the squad that will make the difference
8012700 we just look at the right player and if we can get him we get him if we dont we dont
8012701 if nothing is done it will not limit our ambitions because of it
8012702 the names do not impress me what is impressive for me is the attitude the quality
8012703 there is only one thing important and that is what you do on the pitch
8012704 i agree that what we did on the pitch on saturday was not good enough but all the rest to compare with names is not very interesting and not very useful
8012705 we have done the job well at twente but the job is not over

8012712 there were initially five children ranging from age two up to 17 and four of them got out but unfortunately the two year old toddler did not
8012713 their grandmother made a lot of valiant efforts in getting the kids out she suffered burns and smoke inhalation trying to get the kids out
8012714 currently in the legislation it says you have to have a smoke alarm on every floor in a house what were saying is you should have smoke alarm in every bedroom

8012720 i never had a chance to do one scene the way it was written or the way i wanted it to be the script wasnt respected bad producers bad partners it was a terrible experience
8012721 fox was just trying to get a pg 13 movie im ready to go to war against them but i cant because they dont give a shit i dont see how people who went through all these amazing blockbusters like the dark knight and iron man this summer will take babylon a d
8012722 the movie is supposed to teach us that the education of our children will mean the future of our planet all the action scenes had a goal they were supposed to be driven by either a metaphysical point of view or experience for the characters instead parts of the movie are like a bad episode of 24
8012723 were actively looking like anyone this week is notorious for things being done and well have to see what happens
8012724 were jostling around like other clubs are were under pressure as were short at the back because of injury
8012725 that has left us a bit stretched ive made my feelings known about transfers we need to back up the squad if we can
8012726 everton boss david moyes is finding it very difficult as well well see what this week brings
8012727 were looking in all areas but i need to check what budget is available
8012728 he is under contract and is committed to the club craig remains a very important part of our plans for the future
8012729 the club is being run on sound football and business principles in order to develop a squad which can deliver success this season
8012730 no player would be bought or sold unless that helped to achieve that aim
8012731 we are not interested in selling players who are committed to the club and essential to our first team squad
8012732 its more realistic craig will be ready on saturday sunday morning aest if not saturday then west brom two weeks later
8012733 its not a question of letting him go to wales its a question of whether it will be sensible because hes been out for four weeks
8012734 well cross that bridge when we come to it we have to get through this week first hes so fit as a person
8012735 its uncanny the way this has fallen he has managed to get himself right but its happened just before an international break
8012736 we who had been filled with mutual slaughter and every wickedness have each one all the world over changed the instruments of war the swords into ploughs and the spears into farming instruments and we cultivate piety righteousness love for men faith and hope which is from the father himself through the crucified one
8012737 he who holds the sword must cast it away and that if one of the faithful becomes a soldier he must be rejected by the church for he has scorned god
8012738 under no circumstances should a true christian draw the sword
8012739 we have come in accordance with the counsel of jesus to cut down our arrogant swords of argument into plowshares and we convert into sickles the spears we formerly used in fighting for we no longer take swords against a nation nor do we learn anymore to make war having become sons of peace for the sake of jesus who is our lord
8012740 we who were formerly slayers of one another not only do not make war upon our enemies but for the sake of neither lying nor deceiving those who examine us gladly die confessing christ
8012741 but how will a christian war nay how will he serve even in peace without a sword which the lord has taken away for albeit soldiers had come unto john and had received the formula of their rule albeit likewise a centurion had believed still the lord afterward in disarming peter unbelted every soldier
8012742 the divine banner and the human banner do not go together nor the standard of christ and the standard of the devil only without the sword can the christian wage war for the lord has abolished the sword
8012743 a person who has accepted the power of killing or a soldier may never be received into the church at all
8012744 we cannot endure even to see a man put to death though justly
8012745 you cannot demand military service of christians any more than you can of priests we do not go forth as soldiers
8012746 and so it will not be lawful for a just man to serve as a soldier for justice itself is his military service nor to accuse anyone of a capital offense because it makes no difference whether thou kill with a sword or with a word since killing itself is forbidden and so in this commandment of god no exception at all ought to be made to the rule that it is always wrong to kill a man whom god has wished to be regarded as a sacrosanct creature thou shalt not kill it is always unlawful to put a man to death
8012747 the whole world is wet with mutual blood and murder which in the case of an individual is admitted to be a crime is called a virtue when it is committed wholesale
8012748 and this is at least incredible inasmuch as even now those barbarians who have an innate savagery of manners and cannot endure to be a single hour without weapons but when they hear the teaching of christ straightway instead of fighting they turn to husbandry and instead of arming their hands with weapons they raise them in prayer and in a word in place of fighting among themselves henceforth they arm against the devil and against evil spirits subduing these by self restrains and virtue of soul now this is at once a proof of the divinity of the saviour since what men could not learn among idols they have learned from him
8012749 i am a soldier of jesus christ the eternal king from now i cease from this military service of your emperors and i scorn to adore your gods of stone and wood which are deaf and dumb images i cast down my vine staff and belt and i refuse to serve as a soldier i threw down my arms for it was not seemly that a christian man who renders military service to the lord christ should render it also by inflicting earthly injuries
8012750 it is no longer a question of violence or nonviolence in this world it is nonviolence or nonexistence
8012751 i am not even considering the option of liverpool not qualifying for the group stages i am just thinking about winning
8012752 my concern now is to improve how we play we can play better liege were good in the first leg but we were really poor
8012753 if we improve and play at our real level it will be very difficult for them
8012754 liege are probably the hardest opponents we have faced in the champions league qualifiers but we know we are better than them even though they played well in the first leg
8012755 at anfield we are confident we can win and i expect us to win the key is to be calm and have confidence in your team and the ability of your players we have the players who can win this type of game
8012756 whatever happens it will not really disrupt my transfer plans we are so close to the end of the window things will not change
8012757 but yes i am aware of the financial implications of liverpool not qualifying money is really important but that is always the situation in football
8012758 the key is to do the right things have confidence and then we will not be thinking about such things as not qualifying i am confident that will not be the case
8012759 we are used to the pressure from the first game of the season we are always under pressure we have to win
8012760 that is nothing new about this club or any other at the top but my aim is to work on improving the team and the way we play the team have shown a winning mentality when they have now been playing well so for me there is no need to push the players harder they know what is required
8012761 i am looking for improvement in everything after the performance in liege we must improve in set pieces and in open play we played a bad game in the first leg
8012762 it may have been a bit of a shock for the players when you know very little about your opponents
8012763 but now we understand a lot about them so it will be easier to concentrate and not to make mistakes
8012764 you never know what will happen but really we have a lot of confidence that we will go through
8012765 everyone will be concentrating on this match what happens afterwards is for the future
8012766 i will not be moving anyone on today or tomorrow we are just concentrating on the game and maybe improving the squad if possible
8012767 i was disappointed with the performance in liege and yes we have not been at our best in the two league games since then but if you can win games like we have when you are not playing well that is something positive
8012768 so i have confidence we will improve in how we play and that we will continue winning
8012769 how did you get here how did you find your way out of the yuck these women had lived tragedy like i have never known and they made it back to god made it back to loving him
8012770 t he thought did cross our minds as an option
8012771 but this line from the scriptures kept coming into my head for what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul
8012772 for me the whole world was the olympics at the same time i felt i would be losing my soul
8012773 thats what i want the next generation to understand everything doesnt come up all roses all the time that is the nature of this athletics game
8012774 we began to remember how lottie moon left a legacy behind her in the areas she served and that we now see that those areas are still the most heavily evangelized areas of china even today
8012775 so then we thought there are so many people here sharing christ that day may come that we will hear about beijing turning to christ and a revival sweeping the nation that they will pin to the fact of so many christians sharing christ during the olympics
8012776 well never know the impact of what can happen out of this kind of thing
8012777 the first day when we were down at the plaza area ill bet i had my picture taken 500 times
8012778 i shared with her and she had tears in her eyes and she was so thankful
8012779 she took off her volunteer hat and gave it to me i said no i cannot take your hat its too precious she said but you have shared such good things with me you must have my hat and she gave me her hat then i had tears in my eyes
8012780 its just the easiest way in the world to meet people
8012781 all i have to do is lay them out on the table and people come
8012782 it ended up that our western faces were the attraction
8012783 the ones who were university students they would actively seek us out
8012784 we could have in depth conversations most of them didnt have a concept of god and jesus
8012785 we try to keep a low profile and stay behind the scenes do our work do the follow up
8012786 our goal is personal evangelism with the highest integrity we present the gospel and let the holy spirit do the work
8012787 at lillehammer they lovingly named our pin the jesus pin
8012788 so everybody was talking about the jesus pin everybody wanted one but to have the pin you have to hear the story nobody gets a pin without hearing the story about jesus
8012789 the one thing i had to learn was to develop my own relationship with jesus christ and not piggyback on mom and dads
8012790 aside from the shock and the deep sadness that the team and their families were feeling for their coach and the family there seemed to be almost a sense of guilt over continuing to play a game when matters of such deep significance were happening
8012791 but i think the team concluded that competing with great heart and intensity might be the best way of honoring their coach and the bachman family
8012792 this will always be a bittersweet moment for all of us we will remember the moments of thrill and excitement but will also remember the tragedy that struck the bachman family pointing out yet again how badly we need our savior and lord
8012793 faith and life with god is a daily process and god communicates with me throughout the process
8012794 teamwork integrity work ethic and discipline all play out in the game of volleyball and also happen to be character building so god has used the sport of volleyball to teach me how to be a better man
8012795 im currently a work in progress and like anyone else i face struggles every day
8012796 to be able to have a second chance to be able to come together with these girls was great
8012797 every single year we get better and better we came together the last month and a half im just hoping i can make the next one to keep the string going
8012798 im happy with the effort i gave 100 percent of what i had today
8012799 i did the best i could sometimes everything clicks and it goes great and sometimes it doesnt so you just take what you get on the day and do the best you can
8012800 i didnt even like to run prior to the lords calling that all changed one weekend when my dad and i headed out the door for a 15 mile run around the lake from that day on i knew that god put me on a mission to run equipping me with all the tools and people for the tough road that would lie ahead
8012801 through this journey of being on the national team and this experience ive really grown in christ in the last two years
8012802 i feel like my faith has gotten a lot stronger i dont know how someone could do it without knowing god and having a relationship with jesus i rely so much on him every single day
8012803 i want to thank you so much for what you are doing
8012804 neither the republican nor democrat party are listening to the voters

8012808 we should afford them the respect that they are entitled and call them by their legal name
8012809 whatever decisions adult politicians make will effect my generation and generations to come and i feel like its my duty and responsibility to elect leaders that will make it a world i want to inhabit and that i would want my children and my grandchildren to inhabit

8012813 now the oil companies are placing their bets on john mccain bankrolling his campaign and gambling with our future

8012887 take one lick of the lollipop of mediocrity and you will suck forever
8012888 sure i am this day we are masters of our fate that the task which has been set before us is not above our strength that its pangs and toils are not beyond our endurance as long as we have faith in our own cause and an unconquerable will to win victory will not be denied us

8012900 two well placed sources tell businessweek com the glitches are related to a chip inside apples music playing cell phone the sources add that apple aapl plans to remedy the problems through a software upgrade rather than through a more disruptive step such as a product recall
8012901 one source says the problem lies squarely with infineons technology which is fairly new and untested in high volumes outside a lab setting not only is the iphone shipping in much higher volumes than other handsets its also gobbling up far more 3g minutes as owners use it to surf the web watch youtube goog videos and utilize other bandwidth hogging services

8012908 it is a great honor and privilege to have asked to host our own beyond the pale event at roadburn 2009 since playing roadburn 2007 we could think of no better people to work with on this event than the organizers and promoters of roadburn and the wonderful staff at the 013 roadburn is a completely different experience than the traditional music festival it is a small intimate extremely well organized festival put together by people who love the bands and thrive on creating a unique social vibe where the lines between artist audience and staff are often completely blurred
8012909 2009 also marks the 10th anniversary of our own label neurot recordings what an amazing way to mark our first decade as a label i believe that roadburn and neurosis share a clarity of vision that will result in an amazing experience for us all

8012920 o ur time our energy should be spent in educating agitating organizing our fellow citizens in the workplace in the neighborhood in the schools our objective should be to build painstakingly patiently but energetically a movement that when it reaches a certain critical mass would shake whoever is in the white house in congress into changing national policy on matters of war and social justice

8012927 to gain respect for others even those you may dislike ask yourself
8012928 i do not know why we are always under pressure to buy 30m or 40m players
8012929 i am under pressure to buy good players it is as simple as that
8012930 and good players are not always necessarily linked with the price of a player
8012931 there is still a market to buy the right players we are struggling to find them but we will find them dont worry
8012932 i believe we have the needed squad a strong squad and i believe in the players i have instead of always looking at who might be coming in
8012933 it is up to us as a team to show personality strength and belief within the squad
8012934 what i hate the most is when you have a bad game the only resource is to buy
8012935 we can buy a robinho but i feel we have not to look at chelsea manchester united or liverpool we have to look at ourselves
8012936 you look at financial consequences afterwards what you want first is the quality of your football and the quality of the competition you are in

8012941 vooral in kreuzberg een buurt dat van drie kanten ommuurt was
8012942 opvallend detail is dat de mensen hier roken dat is weer even wennen
8012943 be imitators of god therefore as dearly loved children and live a life of love just as christ loved us
8012944 my life was kind of like a little bit of an emotional rollercoaster i knew there was something missing and always wanted to do my best but i was struggling with it
8012945 at the back of my mind god was always there kind of pushing me and saying why are you doing this
8012946 i had to kind of break away from being a follower to just being my own self and being a leader and finding my way
8012947 i definitely felt different about my life immediately my emotions and just a calming sense just a sense of peace just knowing he was with me at all times and being able to go out and glorify him was probably my greatest joy
8012948 i have to realize im not playing for me im playing for gods glory and im playing so that all the little kids and fans watching can see his light through me
8012949 you have to be away all summer long youre away from your family and away from your friends that was always a really hard time for me when youre growing up and youre not around people who are influencing you in a good way youre lost
8012950 the next year i showed up to the pool i practiced and i kept going
8012951 i still cant explain today why i kept going but i think that was god im so thankful that i kept going and i cant even explain why i did
8012952 its such an accomplishment i didnt just do it for me either my family has sacrificed so much for me to get to where i am im super happy to have the chance to get this far
8012953 it pretty much feels like youre drowning for four minutes
8012954 so the outcome is kind of however the judges want its not about the clock or beating the person next to you its up to the judges
8012955 our goal is to have the best swim weve ever had as a team
8012956 we feel if we can do that hopefully we can get a medal i would be happy if i swam my best and the coaches thought we never swam better
8012957 through this journey of being on the national team and this experience ive really grown in christ in the last two years
8012958 i feel like my faith has gotten a lot stronger
8012959 bryan credits two things with getting his life back on track his success in sports that led him to college and his belief and acceptance of the christian faith
8012960 at azusa pacific university in southern california bryan really began to accept the christian faith that his mother had been trying to instill in him for many years
8012961 a huge reason why i havent been tempted to take drugs or do anything of that sort is because i realize that winning is not my life its not my identity i know that god has me doing what im doing i know that yes i can win i also know that im not going to win all the time and i know that either way win or lose that god is going to provide for me
8012962 were going eight riders wide going 40 mph jumping 40 foot jumps coming off a three and a half story starting hill
8012963 something that the viewers are going to be kind of psyched about everyones ridden a bike and to see what is possible on a bmx bike nowadays is just going to have them in awe of what were doing out there
8012964 we watch what we eat we have to train every day were totally conscious of the responsibility that we have to be role models to the kids
8012965 that theres no reason why i shouldnt be giving my life to the lord
8012966 bmx as a sport is not really one where you see a lot of christian athletes speak out about their beliefs
8012967 i understand that everything that ive been given and been allowed to do is because of christ
8012968 lord i dont have very many friends i feel alone i need you to be my best friend
8012969 the start was bad and the end wasnt that great either
8012970 i think the world has recognized that that island has a lot of talent
8012971 got caught in the zone that we couldnt shake them out of
8012972 im currently a work in progress and like anyone else i face struggles every day
8012973 in the season of my life that i am in now i feel so blessed that god has given me the talent of running
8012974 my running is an amazing gift from god and i want to use it to the best of my ability to glorify him
8012975 a true rags to riches story in the athletics world before this year i was not even a blip on the map of international discus throwers this is truly a blessed year for me and i hope i can use this platform to be a strong mentor to other athletes in the u s relaxation and patience were the keys for me to throw far i was singing a gospel song based in the bible verse joshua 1 9 this verse actually carried me to a winning toss and i knew that whatever happened at the end of the day i was not afraid of loss or success winning or coming in 10th place did not determine my worth as a person but my worth in gods eyes is much more than a gold medal
8012976 even though it wasnt the ending i wanted i wouldnt trade the last four years
8012977 youve got to make up your mind before you dive to enjoy it youre going to walk away with certain memories if you make it good
8012978 left it all in the pool like she always does and shell come out of here with her head held high
8012979 and i want to worship him with it and glorify him with it i know i dont have to win to do that whatever place i come in hes going to be glorified through that if i honor him i want to be a graceful winner and i want to be a graceful loser
8012980 it was a great day for me i felt like i was soaring on wings like an eagle the lord carried me through he blessed me so much today my run fitness wasnt quite there where i wanted it to be i think the maximum result wouldve been sixth i laid it all out there today i came off the bike in great position i started the run well it was a hot one but i did all i could thats all i had
8012981 im trying to take my life and i even messed that up
8012982 she should have left me is what she should have done
8012983 i told him what i was getting ready to do
8012984 i was there for 90 days and god saved me
8012985 i havent been the same since he removed all the desire for drugs all the desire for alcohol he totally changed my life i made every mistake a man could make but god loved me anyway
8012986 i can get to street tough inner city kids and develop a relationship with them through this sport
8012987 once they begin to press me a little bit then im able to minister to them i have seen a whole lot more kids saved through the boxing gym than i have through any of my youth ministries its amazing how god could use a pair of boxing gloves to draw somebody to himself but he does
8012988 most of our kids in this program come from very poor socioeconomic backgrounds
8012989 we were asking 18 19 20 year old kids to give up everything they had
8012990 luis came back a week before we came to beijing
8012991 he was very remorseful very apologetic working hard it seemed like he was a different individual i had tried sharing the gospel with him before he was pretty shut off but this time he was willing to listen
8012992 now already weve seen evidence of that i always tell young people the first thing youve got to do is go tell somebody go tell somebody what you just did and he did thats not easy for a 19 year old that from a reputation standpoint is a pretty tough kid
8012993 so being the good dad i went with him to the local gym and tried to help as much as i could as a parent
8012994 four years later he quit boxing and started pursuing other things but i stayed in it because what i found is through this sport i can reach a lot of troubled kids that i cant reach any other way
8012995 and then working with these kids in being a dad more than anything
8012996 they really try to get the ones that are the most needy
8012997 when joe does something he does it all out its an inspiration to minister with him
8012998 i dont want to preach a sermon i want to be a sermon
8012999 the most powerful way i reach them is being what god called me to be and thats a child of the king as they witness that that becomes contagious
8013000 yeah yeah its not fair here we go 2 3 4
8013001 after four years of tremendous price growth the market needs a breather
8013002 dubai has taken some measures to tackle speculation which will have some impact on the market
8013003 when the correction happens a lot of existing potential buyers will start entering the market on more attractive prices and thus balancing the market going forward
8013004 there is enough demand to take the place of speculation but the demand is at a different price level
8013005 at the worst we could see a soft landing but a sharp correction in the dubai market is far fetched
8013006 the government controls so much of the market that on the supply side it can play a major role i dont think it will allow the market to correct
8013007 o ur time our energy should be spent in educating agitating organizing our fellow citizens in the workplace in the neighborhood in the schools our objective should be to build painstakingly patiently but energetically a movement that when it reaches a certain critical mass would shake whoever is in the white house in congress into changing national policy on matters of war and social justice
8013008 true religion will not let us fall asleep in the comfort of our freedom love thy neighbor is not a piece of advice its a command god my friends is with the poor and god is with us if we are with them this is not a burden this is an adventure

8013010 from the day i rescued an octopus with a clock and a hat
8013011 i didnt want to shorten hartranft and i didnt want to go by just priscilla for six months i performed as i am a girl but it was too vague and awkward to announce i thought maybe i can use my moms maiden name its a lot prettier and simpler
8013012 i wasnt sure if i wanted to put that out there so blatantly so that before you listen to me you know im asian
8013013 but i thought it was sort of cool to embrace the korean half of me which i love
8013014 they do folkier stuff like my music i thought blue note had a lot of integrity and so far its been really good
8013015 it did sort of surprise me when i realized what i had been writing about and why
8013016 now im in a place i finally feel like ive made a home i love my ukulele song find my way home is one of new pieces and its about having this good love that will bring me back home
8013017 we didnt know anything about how booking stuff worked or promoting and all that
8013018 im hoping that we can start putting music out more
8013019 thats probably why we wanted to do those covers for free just instant gratification throw them out there and let people download them right away our album came out two months ago and now we have another album of covers for free for people i like bands that do that
8013020 i think were sort of blessed in that we are all pretty good friends
8013021 there are a lot of bands that are bandmates before theyre friends and thats kind of weird to us
8013022 by the time we were done with the album all i wanted to do was get on the road and play our songs but now im really itching to get back into the studio
8013023 why i write songs in the first place is to get in the studio and start working i really like to use the studio to its full potential as another instrument or whatever then playing live is a completely different experience thats really great as well
8013024 ive been messing around with a bunch of different things just trying to expand our palette
8013025 ive been listening to a lot of shoe gaze stuff of late i think were going to try to add a lot of different sounds on the new record
8013026 we dont ever want to be waiting around for things to happen
8013027 we just want to keep having something were working on all the time and keep going as long as we can

8013031 while our model allows any network or notary component to be compromised we borrow from abraham lincoln and assume that an attacker can fool all of the components some of the time and some of the components all of the time but it cannot fool all of the components all of the time that is we assume that attacks are either 1 localized to a particular network scope or 2 of limited duration since a larger attack is more easily detected and remedied

8013067 the first lesson is you dont necessarily do everything the fans want you to do
8013068 i am a fan too and i would love to have a squad that is much better than everyone elses
8013069 we are very nearly there but not quite i think we are quite happy we are not going to buy somebody who doesnt improve the squad
8013070 i keep saying there is money available but i am not going to say how much but it is enough to buy an experienced international player
8013071 we have won one match and lost one in the league and hopefully we will be in the draw for the champions league arsenal play fc twente in a qualifier at home tomorrow with a 2 0 advantage
8013072 we didnt play well at fulham on saturday but i think all this stuff about us having to buy a complete lot of new players is rubbish
8013073 it did not feel like a big game to me at the time
8013074 i think you take those experiences from that game but it will a different occasion this time
8013075 we all want to win it we will go there to do that and i expect that we will win
8013076 the last time we played in the super cup we lost and it wasnt very nice winning it gives you confidence for the season ahead
8013077 it will be a difficult season because of the game postponed for friday
8013078 last season towards the end we had a great squad to choose from
8013079 the year before we struggled against milan in the champions league when we were also going for the league
8013080 we ran out of players and ran out of legs
8013081 in a way its fallen for us nicely weve only two league games in the first four weeks of the season
8013082 he was a dominant player last season and won a lot of games for us but we do have the players who can come in and create goals and score goals so were hoping it wont be a problem
8013083 he has said it himself that he needs to get into the box more
8013084 he is making some great runs and creating problems he is getting the reward he deserves
8013085 darren is a fantastic footballer and im not surprised other clubs have shown an interest in him
8013086 the players definitely appreciate him perhaps more than other people on the outside do
8013087 one day he made us all get in a five a side goal
8013088 cloughie had his ways his own style that green jumper
8013089 his mark is still there added keane who spent three years with forest before joining manchester united
8013090 you still feel he is around the building in some way and i am sure he is in spirit anyway
8013091 cloughie created history for forest and left behind trophies a brilliant stadium and a style of play which is embedded into the club
8013092 its a nice thing and something which has captured the imagination it would be nice to look out at a sea of green will i be wearing anything green maybe a tie
8013093 a fund like this saves me time my most valuable resource
8013094 the mix of the fund matches the evolution of my financial needs
8013095 the track records of target date funds are not that long
8013096 we try to overweight sectors that will benefit from long term trends in supply and demand
8013097 we try to focus on stocks that are not dependent on a favorable stock market or a robust bond market
8013098 one noticeable difference is the slight tilt to the bottom of the handset where the trackball is located although its a small change its worth noting we love the 5 row qwerty keyboard with the spaced out buttons were curious to see what that menu button is for as well check out the back of the device where it shows with google on it it tells us that t mobile and htc are using the brand recognition to help sell the handset

8013103 for investors as a whole returns decrease as motion increases
8013104 we want to find a few durable businesses run by honorable people and buy at sensible prices
8013105 we dont focus on whether the company will make its numbers next quarter but on the durability of its competitive advantages over the next ten years
8013106 if you just focus on a few simple fundamentals and buy with a margin of safety then you go a long way to minimize true investment risk
8013107 the fund shareholder gets a much more stable ride because of the lending of different approaches
8013108 id say we know our companies better than anyone else

8013135 ehud goldwasser and eldad regev died while fighting to defend the land of israel and it is important that we never forget how and why they were killed our hope is that the learning of torah in their honor will be a blessing for their memories and an inspiration for their families and for jews around the globe
8013136 just because soap is a disaster doesnt somehow make rest the answer simpler is better and rest is generally simpler than soap but there is nothing wrong with a plain old post as an rpc call
8013137 i know what is wrong with soap and it has everything to do with unnecessary complexity and solving the same problems twice but what is the big advantage of making all your calls into get put and delete if post can handle everything you need then whats the problem
8013138 for couchdb rest makes absolutely insanely perfect sense read a document edit put the document back beautiful but for most applications enterprise or not i dont see what the big win is
8013139 the more a service looks like a filesystem the more rest makes sense the more any of its operations diverge from being dumb filesystem operations the more rest breaks down and the worse of a fit it is
8013140 if you put together the notion of service documents with using json as the payload format for a service endpoint youre close to getting the touted programmer friendliness of rpc technologies like xml rpc amp soap wsdl while still building a restful service which works with the web instead of against it

8013161 were gonna start by doing a couple of tracks no pressure the goal is to record something they dig so much everyone else will too
8013162 we were lucky as we were one of the last bands to break through before the music industry changed
8013163 its really hard for new bands to break through now its not that theres a lack of good music its just that labels are struggling financially
8013164 some people say that record labels are bad but people forget that they are the ones who break the bands and get them on their way
8013165 it is a scary time but the industry has seen trouble before and pulled through

8013178 now i missed a few years of the cold war as a guest of one of our adversaries but as i recall the world was deeply divided during the cold war between the side of freedom and the side of tyranny

8013180 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point

8013204 nvidias fully featured linux graphics driver is provided as binary only because it contains intellectual property nvidia wishes to protect both in hardware and in software
8013205 the nvidia driver is the single component in a kde4 free operating system stack causing us most of the hard to solve problems in other words nvidia ko has grave technical shortcomings
8013206 the great advantage of the open source development model is that it is driven by considerations of technical excellence so if you give people enough information theyll not only assist you writing the driver theyll even help you design it
8013207 binary drivers totally negate the shared support and maintenance burden which is what makes open source so compelling additionally there is also a drag effect these binary drivers have on the rest of the ecosystem for instance fedora was under enormous pressure not to release fedora 9 until there was a solution that allowed it to run with the nvidia binary driver fedora chose to ship with a pre release of the x windows system which nvidia refused to support and because the driver was binary fedora couldnt simply fix the problems and ship anyway

8013277 katy says the music business needs more females with opinions but she falls on her own argument because she has been constructed by guys i dont think its real

8013285 publishing in the mainstream media is annoying for example half my editors worsen my submissions
8013286 in the mainstream media i rarely get to write about what i most want to write about a truly honest examination of race in the workplace that schools and colleges are unfair to boys and men that reverse discrimination is a net negative to society and that education especially higher education is americas most overrated product and desperately needs reinvention

8013399 i can spot an autistic child anywhere in a minute
8013400 what is your vision for the visual arts in san diego
8013401 i would like to see a synergy between arts organizations groups artists there should be a general willingness to take risks
8013402 i would wish to see san diego become home to a greater number of significant artists due to having more exhibition opportunities more collectors and more commercial galleries
8013403 that is what education is in art helping people find their way it is rather explaining why each work is good in its own way
8013404 introduce yourself as delacroix and hand them your wet brushes
8013405 influential people need to be educated in the process of purchasing art actively
8013406 if i could make two changes favorable to the visual arts in san diego one would be to have more venues commercial and otherwise so the numerous talented artists in the region would have ample opportunities to exhibit the other to have more intelligent writing about these artists and their work
8013407 launch a successful contemporary art fair in san diego that becomes a catalyst to encourage collecting art showcases this cities art institutions and artists and promotes international cultural tourism
8013408 start with art education in the schools for life enhancement and future support of the arts in the community
8013409 i would create a plan with the city of san diego to integrate local art and artists as well as non indigenous artists into every aspect of public design as well as part of the chamber of commerce
8013410 through synergy art foundations barrio logan east village arts district believe project we hope to provide local artists with work live spaces a cultural center exhibition workshop space and the ability to unify and support our visual arts community
8013411 diversity of art in both media and style and the democratic selection of art are the best ways to regain public faith and improve finance in the art world

8013432 he confessed to investigators and reconstructed the events of that tragic night when he gave the child a blow a blow he did not expect to have such a result
8013433 he was under pressure panicked was very worried about his partners likely reaction and as a result took action to conceal the body

8013435 food can look taste and smell normal so you wont know the infection is there weeks after you purchased the contaminated products
8013436 we also dont know the extent of the outbreak yet and its really too soon to know now that coupled with the long incubation period makes this outbreak very concerning
8013437 both the numbers of suspected cases and confirmed cases will increase as this investigation continues
8013438 i think all of us expect that when we shop that the things we buy or that we eat are going to be safe
8013439 thats why i indicated that its necessary to reform and revamp our food and product inspection regimes
8013440 i dont have any information that would suggest that our military commanders in afghanistan dont believe still that this was a legitimate strike on a taliban target

8013459 not acknowledging good baseball when its there can be perceived as bitter
8013460 a couple of weeks after that he had a meeting with all of his coaches and i knew we were going to get along
8013461 i loved his sense of humor we were from the same part of pennsylvania outside of philadelphia hes full italian im half so we had all these italian things going on there was a lot of common background and we hit it off
8013462 that this guy had a lot of self confidence he was not going to be intimidated by anyone on the staff about his job hes always going to do what he thinks is right in the job regardless of the consequences and ive always respected that
8013463 furthermore after our first year working together i told him and other people youre going to be here at least 10 years if you choose to be i felt that good about his ability there was a mutual respect from the beginning
8013464 that would be an absolute thrill for me and a great challenge for us
8013465 i look at them and i see us and i think when they look at us they see them
8013466 its a style of play an aggressive kind of play based on pitching and defense offensively theres a little bit of difference in philosophy they have more guys that just swing we have more guys who can work an at bat they have more experience overall than we do but i think were built on basically the same concepts
8013467 they have similarities in the way they run a game
8013468 personality wise they are complete opposites but when they run the game they both think everything through thoroughly
8013469 joe is unbelievable i know for a fact he thinks three innings ahead what might happen what could happen what scenarios he wants and chooses having played for both of them theyre incredible joe is just really good at adapting and learning from everything im sure hes grabbed a lot of scioscia but he puts it in his own mold
8013470 but hes one of the coolest guys ive ever been around
8013471 his personality is like a spider it goes in all different directions he wants to be a complete man which is something maybe we should all want
8013472 but theres no doubt you give joe the opportunity to build and give him input on what kind of players theyre going to draft what the player development is going to be what the major league philosophy is going to be hes going to have them going in the right direction
8013473 its great to see ive seen it firsthand joe is a terrific evaluator of talent and hes got a passion for the game that is off the charts
8013474 the marks on the ground tell us that the plane hit the ground tail first and as a result the tail cone the end part of the plane broke off
8013475 i guess i did realize that when the plane was going to take off perhaps it was not going so fast
8013476 and i said to myself something is going on here
8013477 we are now in government house and wont move until the government resigns
8013478 if you buy into it and trust it and believe it itll work for you
8013479 no question about it you can latch on to different philosophies but i can guarantee that if you throw the ball over the plate youre going to be successful if velocity is third or fourth on the list for elements of success for a pitcher youll be way better off
8013480 and if youre walking more guys than the recommended daily allowance you will hear from me
8013481 walks are not a good thing so now its kind of a challenge not to walk anybody and its frustrating when you do
8013482 throughout our organization our people stress fundamentals and good defense
8013483 this isnt a new phenomenon over the last 20 years we have had to turn over some rosters weve had some very good players leave so the system has to stay the same the key is to have the minor league and scouting departments contribute players who can step in and replace them
8013484 more times than not youre not going to out talent your competition
8013485 were not going to get the real big fastball or the real big breaking ball or real big changeup weve had it in santana but were basically not going to
8013486 i cant say thats where the premise of not walking batters came from but the bottom line is you look at our starters at the major league level and the separator is their ability to throw the ball over the plate
8013487 no justification for that call thats a crucial moment in that game youre going to blow calls on bang bang plays that happens fabrication i have no time for and then to be validated by the crew chief i dont like at all thats what pissed me off
8013488 im not backing off on this one because im going to get fined on that so screw em but im telling you thats the kind of call that can cost you a pennant right there
8013489 its much easier to watch on the field than on tv
8013490 tv really creates way too much drama about an event
8013491 ive always felt that so youre watching this little box on the wall i cant stand it when it comes to significant moments i hate to like bag on tv people i like the office curb your enthusiasm on hbo but when it comes to live events it drives me nuts
8013492 we dont ever stop and think about it too much we dont but dont you think its nice to hear it
8013493 hopefully they dont start to believe until theyre sitting there watching tv and were playing in the playoffs
8013494 we cracked open the door with an error a wild throw by catcher and the walks and aybar got the big hit for them
8013495 especially the way things have gone the last 10 years but we knew we had a good team theres always been talent here playing on other teams blue jays red sox we knew they were talented but they either gave it up late or something happened where they lost the game
8013496 but the starting pitching i saw in spring training i said oh my god were really good
8013497 but until youre actually down and see hey we werent just talking we have each others backs that moment kind of sealed the deal we know it now
8013498 im not sure the guys understand the historical importance of this
8013499 nobodys done this this is an epic turnaround for the ballclub and the franchise im excited to be a part of it
8013500 but he beat the odds nobody today wondered what youre going to get from him nobody he came in with his head high he went out there and showed what hes capable of doing every night thats what we need
8013501 very lovingly respectfully but firmly well let him know its no reflection on his character hes a great kid a great player youll see him go off absolutely these last few weeks
8013502 he has to understand that i was there for him
8013503 believe me as a group were working together on this one and were going to make it right
8013504 i just couldnt believe that everything we had prayed for and worked for so long was coming to pass
8013505 to watch him knock those points out event after event i thought its a miracle its god it was great there was even this halo in the sky when it was over a perfect ring it was either a halo or a gold medal
8013506 i was blatantly doing things to get in trouble and see if i could get away with it i made life hard for my parents and brother nick
8013507 that as long as he kept running he would stay out of trouble
8013508 he was not that big bryan was really really thin all through high school there was no muscle tone or anything but the fact that he was really strong willed made the difference
8013509 the thing is he never saw a track meet he was always in an event
8013510 he never sat in the bleachers to watch we made it where if he was not running he was in a field event
8013511 about that time i told him he had to make a decision if this was a dream or a goal
8013512 when a dream reaches a point where its not just fun you have to make a decision anybody can dream but a goal is something you are determined to reach
8013513 when i look at his life hes had many challenges the biggest challenge was to really bring this out in himself and know himself there is still a ways to go now there are more challenges but because of his faith hell get through it
8013514 people here know me and ask how im doing how i am spiritually
8013515 they genuinely want to know how my life is going it plays a huge part in who i am and how ive gotten here
8013516 hes one of the most important people in the world to me
8013517 they call him dad and call their biological father daddy we had adjustment periods but we never gave up mike continued to tell them he was not here to take the place of their father he always kept in touch with greg
8013518 after bryans graduation greg came around more and there was this great healing i can only attribute that healing to mike
8013519 hes one of the most important people in the world to me now hes my neighbor and he comes over and watches tv and eats all our food and has us pay for his dinners i enjoy doing it i wouldnt do it for anyone else but for him ill do it until im broke
8013520 a lot of people think we cant get any closer
8013521 i feel like when he succeeds i succeed hes my brother and i love seeing him happy ive always been with him hoping and praying hed make the olympics now its here and it makes me so happy
8013522 had to become part of my training and career and who i am in my dreams
8013523 he remembers the first time we met but i dont
8013524 apparently i caught his eye we became friends on the track when he was a freshman he was a big flirt thats how he got to know me then he started asking me out hes a charmer he knows how to charm the ladies and i got sucked in
8013525 sorry for all the things i put you through i wanted to let you know you are wonderful parents
8013526 shes had to become part of my training and career and who i am in my dreams
8013527 shes had to make my dreams her dreams its the only way i think it can work otherwise she would end up leaving the situation bitter and upset and she wouldnt be able to support me she is definitely into it she makes a lot of it possible
8013528 when i do become an olympian it will not be a testimony of my greatness or superiority
8013529 but rather a testimony of the blood sweat and tears my family and friends have sacrificed to get me where i am
8013530 what weve found so far is merely the tip of the iceberg
8013531 managed properly canadas share of this incredible endowment will fuel the prosperity of our country for generations and geo mapping will pave the way for the resource development of the future
8013532 god willing with the goodwill of the parties and the tireless work of the parties we have a good chance of succeeding
8013533 there are benefits that i hope will show in the future
8013534 we still have a number of months before us to work toward the annapolis goal and were going to do precisely that
8013535 is not conducive to creating an environment for negotiations yet negotiations go on
8013536 are undoubtedly a main obstacle in the road of the peace process
8013537 where there are permanent taliban settlements and where organized crime groups profit from the instability
8013538 im sure theres going to be a rather difficult period in our discussions
8013539 if it goes in the direction of aggravating relations its not going to be our choice but i want to remind you that cold war was a completely different beast when we were really at each others throats in a big way internationally and this is not going to happen under any circumstances
8013540 their use of force against south ossetia clearly dashed all of those previous resolutions and created a completely new reality
8013541 nobody in the world believes that there is any possibility of an acquittal
8013542 i saw a huge amount of water rivers and rivers of water

8013564 another thing about fence sitters it might be useful at some point to categorize them
8013565 however i think that despite where one stands initially if one is genuinely on the fence about islam
8013566 a selective and appropriate quantity you dont want to overwhelm them with data leaving them with the impression that you are a virulent islamophobe before you make sure of it that they too are collection of any combination of the 3 sets of data about islam should be enough to drive that person to the right place

8013600 this is from the historic rockin dogs san marcos sessions featuring the earlier lineup of sam wilson on guitar vocals dave ellison on bass vocals jim meisland on guitar and scott nichols a k a scott slob on drums
8013601 in 1982 we had a rented practice room in a metal building in san marcos which was owned by vietnam vet auto mechanics they used to work on cars in that building all night long we used to practice until late at night and they gradually grew tired of our racket and evicted us
8013602 before then however we rented a mixer and some mics and recorded a demo of our set on a two track home reel to reel deck
8013603 in spite of a complete lack of knowledge of recording i think the sound quality is better than we got at any recording studios we later used
8013604 i wrote this song so its me singing with sam on backup vocals heavy heartbreakers influence on this one like a lot of our songs jim meisland takes the first lead and sam takes the second this is right around the time we the rockin dogs

8013632 speaking as your landlord and your boss i can say who you can and can not have as a guest
8013633 kirsten met andrew at a gig in new york in july and set her sights on him then
8013634 she was then backstage with him at lowlands in holland and pukkelpop in belgium earlier this month its all a bit mucky as he has been linked with johnnys ex fabiola
8013635 and andrew made quite an impression with the girls in the hawley crowd so theyve got a few things in common there too
8013636 kirsten pulled johnny on razorlights 2007 us tour before turning up at that years sxsw festival on the back of his motorbike
8013637 i wonder if well be seeing her arriving at a gig on trippy andrews flying carpet soon
8013638 fall out of clubs clutching onto amy winehouse agyness deyn or a geldof
8013639 mgmt are a serious band not some five oclock heroes
8013640 i could talk dirty when i was 20 im a lot better in the sack now
8013641 men are more diabolical for sure theyre absolute b ds
8013642 the first thing i notice about a guy are his eyes or his lips im not sure
8013643 the first thing i notice on a woman are the t ts im a t t man
8013644 i think breast implants are awful ive felt them and they are awful
8013645 so many of my friends have had them and theyve gone wrong
8013646 one of my friends t ts started growing like the giant peach and blood started coming out the nipple
8013647 and then another friend of mine had one that sort of moved up to her shoulder one t t was normal and the other was up by her collarbone
8013648 i know only one girl who has good ones and most of them are so hard you can knock on them like a door
8013649 im not into them i mean if i got all saggy like the sacks some women have after they have children id have them done
8013650 im not against them but if you have normal ones just to have them enlarged for the sake of having big ones
8013651 all those pucci numbers and things that i wore when i was 17 that i wont really wear again im saving them for her
8013652 thats my blackmail dont eat your dinner and you wont get my clothes you wont grow and you wont get into my clothes
8013653 it seems to be a little more of a problem than i anticipated
8013654 all you need is 200 people in that crowd to boo and stuff like that and it will be replayed 900 times and thats not what you want out of this
8013655 we need in the white house starting on january 20th barack obama and joe biden
8013656 still doesnt believe that women deserve equal pay for equal work
8013657 he doesnt believe that women deserve the right to choose
8013658 he would turn the clock back when what we need from our president is forward movement more progress the kind of opportunities that we expect for the next generation of americans
8013659 what obama has to have hillary do is stand up and say not only in words but its got to be almost method acting and say it in a way thats believable that she wants barack obama to be president
8013660 frankly goes toward any future political considerations she may have
8013661 the slowdown occurred because it took time for salt lake city to process the backlog
8013662 departure delays occurred because air carriers cannot take off without having filed flight plans
8013663 instead of the macapagal arroyo government pushing for the destructive war in mindanao and cha cha it should focus its influence and power in congress to pass the p125 wage bill and the removal of vat in oil and electricity the prices of basic commodities are sky high while the wages of the majority of the filipino people are still inhumanely low
8013664 provoked armed confrontation and allowed escalating foreign intervention in the countrys internal affairs even in armed confrontations
8013665 the arroyo administration with us instigation and support negotiated in bad faith and raised the expectations of the milf and the moro people when the government negotiators agreed to the signing of the memorandum of agreement on ancestral domain the moa ad while recognizing on paper the moro peoples right to self determination in particular their right to their ancestral domain was calculated to flounder and fail in the face of legal challenges and the unfounded outcry that it would dismember the philippine republic
8013666 malaca ang took no effort to unify its allies from among the christian and moro reactionary political leaders to accept the moa it was a calculated risk the regime took given its sinister agenda of neutralizing if not destroying the milf as a revolutionary armed force and thereafter co opting its leadership
8013667 the milf as a revolutionary force will not surrender its military commanders to the government of the republic of the philippines grp the governments insistence would only result to more armed confrontations and cause greater damage to civilians lives and property regardless of whether they are christian moro or lumad indigenous people
8013668 the milf must ensure that those responsible for attacks on civilians will be held accountable and that these attacks will stop
8013669 nick describes it as like a two story warehouse with tables seven or eight phones tvs and its people who are there for like child support and parking tickets
8013670 he was moving through life and maybe not real appreciative of things

8013673 britney has made clear to everyone that she does not want to be further harassed or contacted in any way by osama sam lutfi now or at anytime in the future
8013674 during the temporary conservatorship the conservators have the power to insure that lutfi will not harm britney anymore if mr lutfi makes any future attempt to contact britney after the temporary conservatorship has concluded britney has made clear she will take all appropriate legal action
8013675 if mr lutfi attempts to contact britney britney will take actions including but not limited to sticking a bucket of kfc over her head then running into a wall britney also reserves the right to say whoop whoop whoop whoop prior to impact

8013711 this is an excellent price given that the oil price has come off stockmarkets are in a mess and the whole situation in russia is changing
8013712 highly unlikely given the terms of the bid its as done a deal as you can imagine
8013713 we view this as an important opportunity to expand on the continuing cooperation between russia and india in the energy sector
8013714 the government has got to be seen to be helping ordinary people in these difficult economic times the price of oil is going up and therefore fuel prices are going up
8013715 my own view on the prospect of a windfall tax on energy companies is that the government will be cautious about introducing something which has an implicit retrospective element to it
8013716 a legalised raid on the companys bank accounts would be very unhelpful because it would scare off investors and also could make the cost of investment much higher and in the end that would end up on the customers bills
8013717 every 1m you take out of each company through this legalised raid is 1m they have to raise elsewhere

8013746 superman returns didnt quite work as a film in the way that we wanted it to

8013749 but now the plan is just to reintroduce superman without regard to a batman and superman movie at all

8013767 its difficult to know the effect on his psychological well being when he grasps the full truth that his education will be followed by approximately four decades of work bills and taxes during which he will also rear his own children to face the same fate all of which will of course be followed by a brief almost inconsequential retirement and his inevitable death

8013816 if they say that proponents of the bill are considered in a state of sin and therefore should be denied communion what about catholics who are now practicing modern family planning methods should they also issue a pastoral letter denying communion to all catholics who use modern methods

8013845 a waste volume is agreed before we sign the contract

8013852 first show on friday everybody felt out of sorts none of us felt like wed connected
8013853 clubs will let me do a showcase of comics when i come in to work the club i work all over the world and ill be able to see comics from that country thats very helpful to me
8013854 i had already booked a comedy club in new york in the 1980s
8013855 knowing what its like and being a comedian whose dream was to do the letterman show i was aware of that so i made myself very approachable and im also very honest with the comedians
8013856 the good thing is people respect my stand up and that kind of helps
8013857 the weird thing is i have to say no 99 percent of the time
8013858 all i know is that its not the eddie brill show its david lettermans so i have to book comedians that make david laugh the style he wants on the show he wants material based comedians the real one of a kind one of an art comics
8013859 not the most popular comics if a comic is very popular thats a bonus but most times that doesnt match
8013860 mistakes a comic just cursing all the time like the one we were at in washington d c the industry showcase for the dc comedyfest or a comic not really preparing for a set that can be seen on television
8013861 a lot of comedians make the mistake of rushing and trying to fit as much material in as they can and that works against them the ingredient im really looking for is poise and if youre rushing it really comes across as unnatural
8013862 we want someone who is clever you can be a little bit racier onstage and still do a set on letterman jim norton nick dipaolo those kinds of comedians have done well on letterman
8013863 nowadays the opportunities are really there for comedians to be really uncensored on the internet and youtube
8013864 there wasnt six shows going on in the same timeslot everyone was watching carson everyone watched what johnny said so thats the way it was with johnny itll never be that again
8013865 last comic standing does a lot more for comedy than anything else on tv because the exposure is huge its unfortunate because the winner often isnt the best comedian in the country they may have marketed themselves well but there isnt one last comic standing winner that id put on letterman because their material isnt unique enough but kathleen madigan and i were talking and the exposure you get on that show is incredible comics who probably couldnt sell any tickets can sell out major venues because of last comic standing comics who were middle slots but that has always been the nature of the beast
8013866 no replace it i would like to see less and less competition and more and more appreciation of the art we would have real judges who give them constructive criticism if it can be a real learning experience it would be great but these shows are just manipulations of talent theyre trying to get so many people to buy stuff during the commercials
8013867 if a comic steals material everyones angry but whos the only one who cares comics
8013868 everyone accuses carlos mencia of stealing jokes but does it stop him from selling tickets or being on tv no and in fact joe rogan the guy who has the guts to out him was treated as the bad guy
8013869 but i dont lose sleep over last comic standing i applaud all the comics and even bad television gets the comedy business known
8013870 thats the great thing about the letterman show we have the ability and the forum to put on the real artists and thats the coolest thing about my job if theyre not funny he doesnt want them on the show
8013871 the last thing id want to do is be a sell out but im not turning down a 25 000 check to work a corporate function so thats just the way it is
8013872 i was on the older version of star search and what i realized about those shows was they were game shows we were under the impression that they were fixed with the old ones was that they manipulated the outcome i saw john mulrooney lose to sue kolinsky i saw frank santorelli lose to jason stuart and both of those were complete miscarriages of justice i was there for the taping of frank santorelli and he destroyed and jason stuart didnt do very well and then they announced the results the audience gasped when they showed the tape back franks set was cut by 20 seconds and they added applause to jasons
8013873 one of the problems with the newer one is they had a manager who booked comedians on the show
8013874 one of the cool things about comedy is you get to tell the truth our society is so based on rationalizing the lies that its such a refreshing endeavor to be a stand up comedian its the one place where you can go to tell the truth
8013875 people are always ready to laugh because people take life seriously people are so shackled by the lessons we learn in our childhood be the same color inside the lines all that stuff that makes us so wracked with guilt and fear it always makes us feel good to laugh and just let go
8013876 i was very excited about the johnny carson festival it was wonderful to be able to honor one of the greats in our business it now has a life of its own its become a yearly thing were already working on next years
8013877 the one thing that norfolk they dont really have a big comedy situation there a lot of times you train an audience if you tell the audience a show starts at 8 and it starts at 8 15 they start coming in at 8 12
8013878 were not showing them crap were only showing them the real high end stand up comedy so thats all they know and its a beautiful thing
8013879 not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 meters
8013880 he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man

8013899 but it does look like walter minnick is playing a shell game with idaho voters about where he actually lives when he registers to vote minnick says his primary residence is in the 1st cd but when he needs to pay his taxes minnick says his primary residence is in the 2nd cd theres no question hes gaming the system

8013907 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
8013908 i thought folks would like to know that we had two yes 2 wv girls selected for the 1995 girls odp region 1 pool this past week hannah abraham and gabi mascaro who will both be playing on the wvusc shox gold u13 girls team in the fall both made the pool i cant remember wv having two girls in a pool before they were terrific and this was thoroughly deserved from what i saw
8013909 there is a new wave of change all around us and if we set our compass true we will reach our destination not merely victory for our party but renewal for our nation and this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans
8013910 so with barack obama and for you and for me our country will be committed to his cause
8013911 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
8013912 the barack obama i know today is the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago hes the same man who drove me and our new baby daughter home from the hospital 10 years ago this summer inching along at a snails pace peering at us anxiously through the rearview mirror feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands determined to give her everything hed struggled so hard for himself determined to give her something he never had the affirming embrace of a fathers love
8013913 all of the things that are going on in the economy arent just by happenstance
8013914 they are a direct result of policies that george bush and john mccain have put in place and now their answer is lets keep on doing the same thing
8013915 one thing i have said several times when i have been with obama is that he really showed a lot of composure against the karl rove style unrelenting attacks
8013916 with climate change and globalisation the ageing of the population is one of the major challenges europe must face
8013917 from 2015 onwards deaths would outnumber births and population growth due to natural increase would cease
8013918 positive net migration would be the only population growth factor however from 2035 this positive net migration would no longer counterbalance the negative natural change
8013919 statistics are never completely clear of course but its clear there is a significant change in behaviour under way theres now a real trend among french youths to drink more regularly usually at weekends to drink more to drink outside in the streets and to drink in order to get smashed all that is really quite new in france and it corresponds quite closely to the british definition of binge drinking
8013920 has made drunkenness among young people commonplace the ever mounting pressure to consume is meticulously organised
8013921 the signal sent by a total ban on the sale of alcohol to minors is very important in a country like france which has always tended to deny that alcohol can be harmful
8013922 but there needs to be a strong preventive strategy to accompany it we need to be able to discuss openly with young people without taboos the dangers and the attractions of alcohol
8013923 investigations by unama found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 women and 15 men fifteen other villagers were wounded or otherwise injured
8013924 this is matter of grave concern to the united nations i have repeatedly made clear that the safety and welfare of civilians must be considered above all else during the planning and conduct of all military operations the impact of such operations undermines the trust and confidence of the afghan people in efforts to build a just peaceful and law abiding state
8013925 the patience of the afghan people has run out we no longer can afford to see the killing of our children
8013926 i want to remind all parties engaged in the conflict that the protection of civilians must be their primary concern they must respect their duties under international humanitarian and human rights law to protect the people we are here to serve
8013927 the capability and their opportunity and what they had for their weaponry i dont see that they would have been able to carry it out
8013928 there is a fine line between a credible threat and a threat that is carried out
8013929 it is not up to us to determine whether or not it was a credible threat we saw that there was criminal activity going on and given the heightened security because of the convention we had to notify other agencies
8013930 we cant sit and wait until folks have done the final analysis we have a duty to react
8013931 he dont belong in political office or blacks dont belong in political office
8013932 looking back at it i dont want to say yes but i dont want to say no
8013933 she was really kind to me i didnt really talk to many of the people on bobby but lindsay and i got along really well
8013934 then when they were struggling to find the character to play opposite her in i know who killed me lindsay suggested me i met with the producers and got the part it seemed to be a pretty good role and the cast was great
8013935 but lindsay was going through a lot of personal things in the media and there was a lot of pressure on her shes a tremendous talent but she was very young and she was basically carrying this multi million movie
8013936 ive got nothing bad to say about lindsay she helped me buy my house
8013937 if god did not give us free will how can it really be love that god requires love can only take place in an environment of free choice since god does demand love he must have given each person free will so that he can exercise his will and choose to love god
8013938 consumers are not interpreting the marked decrease in crude oil prices as an all clear signal when it comes to purchasing power
8013939 the last time the expectations index of ifo was this low the german economy fell into a sharp recession
8013940 an increasing trend is bringing cocaine by aircraft instead of by boat into west africa then it is taken on by land or ship to europe across some dangerous and difficult terrain
8013941 we are forcing criminals to raise their risk factors by turning up the heat and forcing them out of their comfort zones
8013942 its too early to tell how much cocaine is arriving but it is not a small amount
8013943 corruption has always been in the back of our minds in difficult operating environments such as africa it is a challenge to find partners who we can trust but we are making headway
8013944 it appears that additional enforcement efforts have had little adverse effect on the availability of illicit drugs in the uk
8013945 since 2000 average street prices in the uk have fallen consistently for heroin cocaine ecstasy and cannabis
8013946 there is some evidence to suggest that a two tier market for powder cocaine has emerged in the uk during recent years at both wholesale and street levels these data suggest that there is now an expanding market for cheaper heavily adulterated cocaine among young people and students for example and that higher purity cocaine is aimed at more affluent buyers
8013947 over the past 10 years cocaine has become increasingly available in the uk while it still retains its glamour image prices have fallen and put the drug within the reach of a wide range of people for whom cocaine has become an unremarkable part of their lifestyle
8013948 it seems as if this process began with the break up of the large cocaine cartels in colombia during the early 1990s resulting in the development of several smaller cartels who needed to find new outlets beyond the traditional us market
8013949 with climate change and globalisation the ageing of the population is one of the major challenges europe must face
8013950 from 2015 onwards deaths would outnumber births and population growth due to natural increase would cease
8013951 positive net migration would be the only population growth factor however from 2035 this positive net migration would no longer counterbalance the negative natural change
8013952 every parent wants the most outstanding place for their child and there should be enough to go round
8013953 the proportion of daycare providers inspected with good or outstanding childcare has risen from 53 in 2005 06 to 64 in 2007 08 though the proportion of childminders judged good or outstanding has fallen from 65 to 59
8013954 parents should keep the ofsted reports in perspective its the experience of one inspector on one day and they fulfil an important function in keeping things safe but the school gate and nursery car park are the best places to find out what a nursery is like
8013955 though only a small proportion of childcare settings are inadequate that masks the fact that there are almost twice as many inadequate childminders this year providers judged to be inadequate have significant improvements to make if they are to meet the demands of the eyfs and provide the high quality education and care children deserve
8013956 its heartening that childcare in this country is improving but we want to drive up standards even further that is why we are introducing the eyfs in september which will give every child equal right to the best quality care and learning
8013957 the government has got to be seen to be helping ordinary people in these difficult economic times the price of oil is going up and therefore fuel prices are going up
8013958 my own view on the prospect of a windfall tax on energy companies is that the government will be cautious about introducing something which has an implicit retrospective element to it
8013959 a legalised raid on the companys bank accounts would be very unhelpful because it would scare off investors and also could make the cost of investment much higher and in the end that would end up on the customers bills
8013960 every 1m you take out of each company through this legalised raid is 1m they have to raise elsewhere
8013961 everybody is scared its not normal to not be scared
8013962 but im not scared as much now i have letters and other things from people telling me how ive helped so many people in numerous ways that makes me feel good
8013963 i just want to say thanks to the people for keeping me going
8013964 all them little cards and stuff i got keeps me going day by day to know im going downhill a little bit it doesnt bother me because ive helped so many people since ive helped so many people this is easier to handle
8013965 life aint about how many breaths you take its what you do with those breaths
8013966 we would get things in the mail almost every day from people all over the country
8013967 people would sometimes call too just wanting to talk to him
8013968 some wanted to come meet him it was amazing i guess he touched so many people we were in the airport at newark n j and people were coming up to him because they recognized him
8013969 he said to them you never know what life might bring you you might have a few sniffles and think its not a big thing then you go to the doctor the next day and they tell you that you have a 10 pound tumor in your stomach
8013970 their manager joe maddon called and said he saw the story on john on espn and he was just in his hotel room in tears
8013971 it was a good time because we both got to experience it and it felt like something not just for me but something he enjoyed as well
8013972 the first time she was here john said i know why youre here
8013973 i really cant explain how his story took off but the kid was just unbelievable
8013974 his attitude and messages i think changed how some people looked at their lives he changed how i went about life
8013975 i feel like a piece of my heart is gone now the thing ill miss most is his smile he had a smile that could light up a room
8013976 i could see people having some beers and hopefully remembering how i always tried my best no matter what i was doing thats my message just for people to always do their best no matter what theyre doing or how stupid it might seem and no matter what there will always be a reward no matter how small it is
8013977 la rotativa del maipo m s que un diario una revista
8013978 no me voy a poner conchero ni voy a ser el borracho de la fiesta
8013979 voy a venir a leer la tapa del diario voy a charlar con la gente sobre lo que quiera tambi n voy a bromear sobre la actualidad y a repartir declaraciones juradas de los pol ticos de kirchner
8013980 i had the opportunity to do deals with a number of record labels but im confident about my music and the future of bandstocks which seems to be a much more honest and transparent way to release records
8013981 well yes but not as a music therapist it was my husband
8013982 wow i wish joe and i would have had this gift of music therapy while he was sick
8013983 wow i really want to be able to bless other families with this gift of music therapy
8013984 ive been learning and discovering that there can be as much beauty and power in death as there is in birth
8013985 the offer on the table is still short of what we would consider full value for rio tinto and its prospects and these results emphasise that
8013986 we are demonstrating what rio tinto is really capable of
8013987 there is no question that we are living in an era of unprecedented demand for minerals and metals
8013988 it was unthinkable to keep the bridge shut until then given the pedestrian part is ready
8013989 too much importance to this architect who has already done a lot of damage
8013990 the most incredible opportunity any president and vice president will have since franklin roosevelt
8013991 all changed in 1960 when kennedy chose lyndon johnson as his running mate
8013992 will make the next president cautious about giving the vice president too much authority
8013993 if for some reason obama is incapacitated or perish the thought dies in office people know he would be a competent president
8013994 the office has explicit legal powers now maybe some will be rolled back but they cant be rolled back easily
8013995 hes a rudder he has a handle on the bureaucracy and knows how to get things done
8013996 conducting an internal assessment but no decision has been made
8013997 this is an excellent price given that the oil price has come off stockmarkets are in a mess and the whole situation in russia is changing
8013998 highly unlikely given the terms of the bid its as done a deal as you can imagine
8013999 we view this as an important opportunity to expand on the continuing cooperation between russia and india in the energy sector
8014000 its early to say who was behind the attack we are looking into all aspects
8014001 they the militants believe this force has become a stooge promoting someone elses agenda
8014002 if george w bush was seeking re election wed be 20 points ahead
8014003 in arizona the only way to get around is by small private plane
8014004 we coach little league in the blue states and have gay friends in the red states
8014005 we are very happy that dawn airey will start at the end of october working for five and she will make a difference
8014006 the programme budget for five has increased this year regarding next year please understand that i will want to give dawn the answer she will have the programme budget she needs to be successful
8014007 it seems as if we have changed our driving behaviour rapidly and drastically
8014008 theres been a lot of coverage on how to squeeze a few extra miles out of your tank driving slowly is one way to do that
8014009 combines fact fiction emotion and religion and manipulates discontent about local and international issues the narrative is simple flexible and infinitely accommodating it can be adapted to suit local conditions and may have a disproportionate influence on the understanding and interpretation of local or global events
8014010 the fallout of the credit crisis will continue to dampen the global economy over the next 24 months with sharply escalated oil and food prices beginning to test inflation expectations
8014011 this may impact temaseks ability to divest its stake in various entities and manage its portfolio
8014012 very noticeable for his shock of red hair his very bucolic clothes and his enormous eyes which seemed to be trained upon me
8014013 it was a marvellous thing to live in the functional light drenched architecture
8014014 no one at the guardian wanted to learn about architecture
8014015 when i broke up with my husband last summer we decided to sell the house to split the equity and pay for the divorce
8014016 but despite dropping the price twice we still havent sold so were stuck in a situation where were still not divorced and although we try to maintain a reasonable front with each other in front of our six year old daughter underneath its very strained and there have been times when she has seen things she shouldnt have the emotional impact is massive and sometimes i feel like tearing my hair out my only saving grace is that since ive started telling people about it ive realised how common it is
8014017 what the little research out there does tell us is that people often have unspoken goals about money that they dont share even with each other
8014018 in times of economic boom they just get on with it but in times of uncertainty resentment can kick in well if you hadnt insisted on having this house or bought your 17th pair of shoes we wouldnt be in this situation oh and i suppose your top of the range satnav has nothing to do with us heading for debt and so on
8014019 money is one of the primary reasons or causes of a divorce and when you have a downward economy that exacerbates the financial troubles and tensions in marriage
8014020 were in a situation where creative problem solving is at an absolute premium in terms of choosing a divorce attorney
8014021 in a time of declining property values you do get cases where neither party wants to resolve matters until values of property have ceased falling
8014022 they simply subdivided their house into properties so the wife and children effectively occupied two thirds and the husband one third
8014023 my studio is in the home so moving out wasnt an option for me but i couldnt afford to buy him out of the mortgage right away the problem was he couldnt afford to move out until id done that so we were stuck thankfully we had a spare room
8014024 once you make the decision to separate you want to start your new life it stopped me dating and i didnt feel i could socialise at home then there were the little things such as washing and ironing do you get petty and say im not doing yours even though its in the basket do you say im only cooking my dinner not yours i didnt feel comfortable with that so we were still living much of our lives like a couple
8014025 its not that we werent civil to each other we have two children aged eight and five and were very mindful of them and still did some things with them together but my wife went off with someone else and that was hard the house is still on the market despite us dropping the price by 10 000 at a time i wonder when its ever going to end
8014026 i dealt with a guy who lived with his wife for a year while they waited to sell up shed left him but he still loved her
8014027 in the end he started doing things such as removing her food from the fridge and hiding her hair straighteners it doesnt sound much but imagine it all the time
8014028 those in council accommodation wouldnt be touched by a house sale and those at the top end still seem to be saying what spending problems despite the credit crunch
8014029 its the middle bracket where the primary asset is the house who are suffering they may well have stretched themselves for 15 or more years
8014030 despite splitting up with my boyfriend a month ago were having to live together until september in a rented one bedroom apartment where sleeping on the couch isnt even really an option for any length of time because its a two seater
8014031 its hideous but at 1 500 per month for a pretty standard flat in clapham south london theres no way one of us can move out because the other wouldnt be able to meet the bills thankfully there are nights when im able to stay away and sometimes he works overseas but there are times we have to share the bed with pillows down the middle
8014032 my partner and i separated before christmas but the house hasnt sold and its really stressful
8014033 i think the worst thing is that the children know were separated our families know and our friends know but were still here in this limbo state a couple of days ago the estate agent said we should drop the price again this time by 25 000 my partner says no way but part of me feels our situation is so desperate that maybe we should just do it so that we can get a buyer and move on with our lives
8014034 if youre a wife with a low income capacity and youre told your house has to be sold and that because your house is worth less than you thought you have to move into accommodation that you would never have dreamed about living in defending the divorce is one way to put a hold on everything the husband on the other hand may be keen to get divorced now because he is worth far less than he was six to 12 months ago which means the payout to his wife is far less than it would have been
8014035 ive seen clients recently where they weigh up the pros and cons and theyve agreed with their partner that splitting up is actually not worth it
8014036 show upcoming org events near you and where your friends are
8014037 these are more like ipods than they are like computers you don t want your phone to be an open platform
8014038 the government has got to be seen to be helping ordinary people in these difficult economic times the price of oil is going up and therefore fuel prices are going up
8014039 my own view on the prospect of a windfall tax on energy companies is that the government will be cautious about introducing something which has an implicit retrospective element to it
8014040 a legalised raid on the companys bank accounts would be very unhelpful because it would scare off investors and also could make the cost of investment much higher and in the end that would end up on the customers bills
8014041 every 1m you take out of each company through this legalised raid is 1m they have to raise elsewhere
8014042 straight up and down i thought it was gonna suck i was like lindsay lohan are you joking are you serious what the hell am i going to do for lindsay lohan i took it as a challenge and we put together a record for her
8014043 its a quality record one that i didnt think she was going to be able to pull off again i will admit that straight up and down i had to eat my words i tried to call her and apologise for the assumption
8014044 our first priority must be the safety of the public
8014045 we suggest strictly enforced government mandated daily dose limits for toxic metals in all dietary supplements and requirements that all manufacturers demonstrate compliance through independent third party testing
8014046 a thousand years ago it was thought that through heating lead was made non toxic which is clearly not the case these traditions live on and they carry on endangering our health
8014047 tell people that biology and the environment cause obesity and they are offered the one thing we have to avoid an excuse
8014048 as it is people who see more fat people around them may themselves be more likely to gain weight young people who think many of their friends binge drink are likely to do so themselves girls who think their peers engage in early sex are more likely to do so themselves
8014049 peer pressure and social norms are powerful influences on behaviour and they are classic excuses
8014050 we will take action to ensure people have the opportunities information and incentives towards healthy living
8014051 tackling the environment should not be a licence to lecture people because they have no excuse not to exercise or eat their fruit and vegetables nannying at least among adults is likely to be counterproductive providing information is empowering lecturing people is not so no excuses no nannying
8014052 we must not constantly talk about tackling obesity and warning people about the negative consequences of obesity instead we must be positive positive about the fun and benefits to be had from healthy living trying to get rid of peoples excuses for being obese by tackling the issue in a positive way
8014053 the proper role of government is to create certainty in the market and maintain a clear distinction between compulsory regulation and voluntary action where necessary the government should regulate clearly and enforce the regulations strongly
8014054 there is a risk that responsibility deals would confuse this issue by being almost a form of regulation by proxy and would lack credibility
8014055 the most incredible opportunity any president and vice president will have since franklin roosevelt
8014056 all changed in 1960 when kennedy chose lyndon johnson as his running mate
8014057 will make the next president cautious about giving the vice president too much authority
8014058 if for some reason obama is incapacitated or perish the thought dies in office people know he would be a competent president
8014059 the office has explicit legal powers now maybe some will be rolled back but they cant be rolled back easily
8014060 hes a rudder he has a handle on the bureaucracy and knows how to get things done
8014061 the monthly numbers of approvals for house purchase which have fallen by some two thirds over the last year levelled off in july it would however be premature to think that the housing market will now start to recover because overall approval activity continues to be very low
8014062 mortgage activity appears to be stabilising although the paltry level of activity is not supportive of a near term pick up in house prices
8014063 few crumbs of comfort can be taken from recent signs that mortgage activity may have finally found a floor amid a backdrop of a stalling economy and expected rises in unemployment
8014064 the shortage of mortgage funding has limited activity across the mortgage market including the buy to let sector which has a significant number of lenders that rely on wholesale funding
8014065 these figures show the extent of uncertainty in the housing market which alistair darling made worse by sending out confused signals over a stamp duty holiday
8014066 many people are putting their lives on hold as a result of labours economic incompetence the chancellor should adopt the conservatives plan to abolish stamp duty for nine out of 10 first time buyers
8014067 the pressures on household budgets are reflected in the relatively weak rise in individuals deposits and with consumer borrowing growing only slowly it seems that consumers are acting prudently
8014068 the capability and their opportunity and what they had for their weaponry i dont see that they would have been able to carry it out
8014069 there is a fine line between a credible threat and a threat that is carried out
8014070 it is not up to us to determine whether or not it was a credible threat we saw that there was criminal activity going on and given the heightened security because of the convention we had to notify other agencies
8014071 we cant sit and wait until folks have done the final analysis we have a duty to react
8014072 he dont belong in political office or blacks dont belong in political office
8014073 looking back at it i dont want to say yes but i dont want to say no
8014074 i had the opportunity to do deals with a number of record labels but im confident about my music and the future of bandstocks which seems to be a much more honest and transparent way to release records
8014075 i have seen the lights from my flat when someone was practising
8014076 notts will be disappointed that the lights didnt come on but i think every england player was delighted to finish so early the wickets are good but the most pleasing thing is being part of this england bowling unit i think the wicket had good bounce from a good length but it didnt have any demons in it
8014077 apart from losing world cup semi finals this defeat is as disappointing as anything i have experienced the test series had some of the best moments in my career and this was right down there in terms of the lowest
8014078 the only person who can officially open parliament will be determined by the outcome of the dialogue
8014079 i will be the first to sign up to a move towards a political project which i would like to lead
8014080 so of course i will accept the foremost task of a party member if the socialists will trust me with it
8014081 we intend to come together with a clear direction reformist european environmental and dedicated to a left that works to win in 2012
8014082 as people feel that its not a problem for me it is no longer a problem for them
8014083 based on a recent in depth review of the scientific literature the who concluded that current evidence does not confirm the existence of any health consequences from exposure to low level electromagnetic fields
8014084 however some gaps in knowledge about biological effects exist and need further research
8014085 we temporarily modify the activity in this area artificially from the outside
8014086 its a way to stimulate nerves in the cortex without having to open the skull and insert electrodes
8014087 it is really the only way we can make such an investigation in healthy volunteers to say something about brain areas that are critically involved in a certain behaviour
8014088 when i was younger i enjoyed books by both men and women
8014089 i generally enjoy a sock on both my left foot and my right
8014090 up your arse im old enough to say whatever i like
8014091 come on men white men men of my class are just better at this stuff
8014092 as we have a very obliging director in john wardle the loan was made by him and it was repaid in two days it was never needed to pay wages
8014093 vegan food tends to have less fat in it a higher volume of fat delays gastric entry so with most vegan food you simply start processing your food faster its also the case that you might end up pacing yourself a bit better as the food needs more chewing people who wolf their food down tend to have a higher calorific intake
8014094 its important not to overstate the health benefits of vegan food
8014095 vegans can struggle to get sufficient amounts of calcium and vitamin b12 in their diet its all about getting the balance right and you can find the balance as a meat eater too its called the mediterranean diet
8014096 lucentis is an expensive drug costing more than 10 000 for each eye treated but that cost needs to be balanced against the likely cost savings age related macular degeneration results in reduced quality of life and increased risks of illness particularly in relation to accidents especially falls and psychological ill health
8014097 it has been estimated that the costs related to sight impairment for patients treated with lucentis are around 8 000 cheaper than for patients who receive best supportive care over a 10 year period
8014098 nices guidance will finally bring an end to a cruel postcode lottery
8014099 there is now nowhere left for pcts to hide we want them to implement nice guidance immediately rnib is also calling on hospitals to ensure they build capacity as a matter of urgency so they can save the sight of patients without further delay
8014100 at present we cannot detect differences in effects or risks although avastin may require fewer injections as it appears to last longer after each injection so the taxpayer may wish to question why they are paying so much more for lucentis when avastin appears to achieve the same outcome
8014101 more banks will come on the list as credit problems worsen
8014102 by any yardstick it was another tough quarter we continue to strongly encourage banks and institutions to ensure they have enough reserves to cover losses
8014103 the overwhelming majority of banks 98 of them continue to be well capitalised by regulatory standards
8014104 we believe institutions can and will step up to the plate to provide whatever insurance funds are needed
8014105 when i broke up with my husband last summer we decided to sell the house to split the equity and pay for the divorce
8014106 but despite dropping the price twice we still havent sold so were stuck in a situation where were still not divorced and although we try to maintain a reasonable front with each other in front of our six year old daughter underneath its very strained and there have been times when she has seen things she shouldnt have the emotional impact is massive and sometimes i feel like tearing my hair out my only saving grace is that since ive started telling people about it ive realised how common it is

8014109 money is one of the primary reasons or causes of a divorce and when you have a downward economy that exacerbates the financial troubles and tensions in marriage
8014110 were in a situation where creative problem solving is at an absolute premium in terms of choosing a divorce attorney

8014125 ive seen clients recently where they weigh up the pros and cons and theyve agreed with their partner that splitting up is actually not worth it
8014126 all it could have taken was the vibrations from a kickabout in the garden or some loud music and we would have been blown to pieces in a pile of rubble and smoke
8014127 im 27 as well and theres a tradition of musicians meeting their end at my age its all sorted now and we should be moving in there in a few weeks
8014128 and im carrying four tons of canaries ive got to keep two tons of them up in the air all the time
8014129 shes the best stepmom sam lola and cassandra could ever hope for seeing her love and affection with those three i know shell be an amazing mom
8014130 unless i bat 100 per cent perhaps a boy awaits us
8014131 it is obvious that being the head of a company you have to delegate some tasks
8014132 there are employees colleagues or co producers to which you assign things to
8014133 tom cruise being an actor in the film it was not his task to be at the set and to check personally whether all the security measures were taken
8014134 but according to us american law he can be held legally responsible for the security measures not having been in place
8014135 for the moment we communicated our realistic demand of 11 million
8014136 this is going to be the basis of negotiations for now if the opposite side contacts us and we sit down to talk
8014137 di masjid negara bahawa beliau tidak pernah melakukan sebarang penipuan di dalam pilihan raya
8014138 kalau setiap kali berlaku pendakwaan pendakwa dan yang didakwa perlu bersumpah mahkamah islam pasti akan jadi bahan tawa orang lain
8014139 ada sesetengah pihak yang tersalah sangka dengan menganggap bahawa cadangan saya untuk dsai dan saiful bermubahalah itu satu perangkap untuk menjatuhkan dsai
8014140 other parents think its funny that im there doing that im a mom you have to do it and i love it
8014141 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time
8014142 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits
8014143 to all of our family and friends we are pleased to announce that our little princess anja louise ambrosio mazur was born on sunday august 24 at 7 32 p m she is 6 3 pounds and absolutely perfect
8014144 she hasnt cried once except for a second when they pulled her out we have now felt a new kind of love and joy that we never knew existed
8014145 the word is commonly used in a derogatory manner against people of the muslim faith or arab origin
8014146 it is unfortunate a major film studio would choose to exploit an ethnic slur as a sensational promotion for a movie mainstreaming a bigoted term in this manner will only serve to legitimise and normalise anti muslim prejudice in our society
8014147 you never know which part of the internet youll need
8014148 which is why all the parts of the internet are on the iphone
8014149 the story you are about to see is true the names have been changed to protect the innocent
8014150 what do we care if we were expelled from college scarlett the war is going to start any day now so wed have left college anyhow
8014151 hes a 17 year old kid hes scared all hes facing now is misdemeanors so if somebody has any idea where hes at they need to tell him come with me ill take you down there well get this straightened out
8014152 we extend our condolences to the families of all the victims of this disaster
8014153 a consular official has travelled to bishkek to liaise with kyrgyz authorities and will continue to be in contact with local authorities until the remains of the canadians have been identified and repatriation funeral arrangements are completed according to the wishes of the next of kin
8014154 albertas economy continues to do well despite a general slowdown in global economic activity
8014155 i think its clear that alberta is still leading the nation
8014156 but i dont think anyone can remember a time when weve had such wild and wide fluctuations in energy prices
8014157 we should be having 13 billion in savings this year not 2 5 billion in maybe savings
8014158 we may have a savings opportunity here that we may not have five years from now
8014159 when we look forward in the future and say i want to stay this prosperous forever i think the chances of that are pretty slim
8014160 my son is an innocent boy and we are a well respected family here
8014161 he hasnt incited anyone to kill mr brown he hasnt plotted with terrorists we havent even got a tv here or the internet
8014162 he was going to finland for holy month there was going to be a grand opening but he has missed that hes been going there for six years he always teaches abroad
8014163 its wrong that hes being held why are they taking this long
8014164 it was like the big equipment was there but everything was just pretty much gone and you could look up through the ceiling
8014165 the biggest challenges we had here was setting up the kitchen to be able to cook out it
8014166 we have to use the styrofoam trays since we have no dishwasher
8014167 this was just nothing more than just a couple bars under here and the kids would get their trays and come down the younger children theyre very tippy and wobbly so our janitor put this on so for us so the kids dont they dont loose their trays on the floor any more
8014168 i like it a lot its exciting because before we had to eat with our teachers and that was no fun
8014169 it feels like were partly normal where were supposed to be
8014170 you see the kids needed help they were stuck under the tables i just reacted
8014171 once the shooting started they students all jammed underneath the tables and they just froze under there and they were yelling
8014172 i just got under there and just helped with the evacuation and i stayed on until he shot himself
8014173 gang related or does this have something to do with the
8014174 livin my life posted on other sites in any case heres the latest track off
8014175 gang related or does this have something to do with the
8014176 they are an extra pair of eyes and ears and if tasked properly they will get results because unlike police officers who can get diverted they are usually on the street for seven hours engaging with the community
8014177 the dup is impatient with the foot dragging on ending the ira army council and wants to see a greater flow of information to the police about those who were nurtured by the ira but who now continue attacks under different labels the move to democracy is an ongoing commitment and a continuing journey it is not a move of convenience or a tactical step
8014178 a meeting of the executive has been scheduled for september 18 if this meeting were not to take place it is self evident that there would be serious consequences for the good government of northern ireland and indeed potentially for those who refuse to fulfil their legal obligations
8014179 we have agreements in terms of justice and policing in terms of the irish language act and so on and we want those delivered on its not a case of threatening anything its just a case of recommitting ourselves to actually delivering
8014180 we are not just dealing with a system that is overwhelmed by overcrowding though overcrowding is a serious problem in some prisons we are also dealing with a system that is overwhelmed by numbers the proposal to add 7 500 to these three massive prisons is going simply to add another set of places where regimes will suffer because they will have to accommodate the needs of several different kinds of prisoners who we expect to be kept from one another
8014181 those present were overwhelmingly opposed to the proposal and believed there were other ways of deploying the huge sums of money involved that would make a far more effective contribution to the governments stated objectives
8014182 prisoners will be accommodated in small units capable of addressing their needs and offending behaviour they will be situated close to those areas which generate the greatest volume of offenders therefore ensuring that important family and other links can be maintained
8014183 combines fact fiction emotion and religion and manipulates discontent about local and international issues the narrative is simple flexible and infinitely accommodating it can be adapted to suit local conditions and may have a disproportionate influence on the understanding and interpretation of local or global events
8014184 its disappointing that each year we see a small minority of mainly young men who dont come to the carnival until later
8014185 they dont come to enjoy the floats and the music they come to fight and commit acts of violence we have seen serious incidents in previous years
8014186 for two hours our officers came under attack from bottles bricks and any debris that was on the ground these were officers who had been working hard all day
8014187 for example a bbc radio documentary exposing tensions between leadership and supporters
8014188 there will be european chauvinism judge corruption buying of brawn and brains and a strong dose of racism
8014189 just a message for my darling sister lorraine who just stepped on at this station remember how you said that if you ever saw that i was the driver of a train you would not get on it well i am the driver and you are on my train stand clear of the doors please
8014190 we are seeking a declaration that klausners visual voicemail patent is invalid and that verizons system does not infringe the patent in any event
8014191 the arrest is part of an ongoing investigation by lancashire constabulary and greater manchester counter terrorism unit
8014192 this is a very sensitive time for all our communities and we are working hard to ensure everyone is kept up to date with as much information as we can give
8014193 we will endeavour to carry out any searches as quickly as possible to minimise impact on the area concerned however inquiries of this nature are complex and may take time to resolve
8014194 i would like to thank local residents affected by the arrests for their cooperation and ask that they remain patient
8014195 if there is a real security issue people will always support and cooperate with the police but a lot of people are put in custody and are actually innocent and that has created anxiety in people to ask what is the investigation about
8014196 have people just gone on to the internet and read about things or are they actually planning on doing something
8014197 the local residents are quite happy with the way the police have treated the whole incident the asian officers make a difference when the asian officers are there and explain whats happening its more of a relief
8014198 tell people that biology and the environment cause obesity and they are offered the one thing we have to avoid an excuse
8014199 as it is people who see more fat people around them may themselves be more likely to gain weight young people who think many of their friends binge drink are likely to do so themselves girls who think their peers engage in early sex are more likely to do so themselves
8014200 peer pressure and social norms are powerful influences on behaviour and they are classic excuses
8014201 we will take action to ensure people have the opportunities information and incentives towards healthy living
8014202 tackling the environment should not be a licence to lecture people because they have no excuse not to exercise or eat their fruit and vegetables nannying at least among adults is likely to be counterproductive providing information is empowering lecturing people is not so no excuses no nannying
8014203 we must not constantly talk about tackling obesity and warning people about the negative consequences of obesity instead we must be positive positive about the fun and benefits to be had from healthy living trying to get rid of peoples excuses for being obese by tackling the issue in a positive way
8014204 the proper role of government is to create certainty in the market and maintain a clear distinction between compulsory regulation and voluntary action where necessary the government should regulate clearly and enforce the regulations strongly
8014205 there is a risk that responsibility deals would confuse this issue by being almost a form of regulation by proxy and would lack credibility
8014206 a comprehensive and intellectually rich compendium of the state of the art knowledge on sustainable urban development the scholarly judicious choice of topics and contributors and the sequencing of the readings are admirable a carefully crafted synthesis of the major themes associated with sustainable urban development
8014207 setelah mendapat pengakuan dari sangkap kita langsung lakukan pengejaran terhadap irsal tidak ada kesulitan hanya sekitar setengah jam dari penangkap sangkap irsal berhasil kita tangkap yang saat itu sedang berada di depan mangga dua square
8014208 kami sudah melakukan pengecekan peta trase lahan untuk jalur jorr w2 ini patok patok yang sudah ditanam sejak 2006 di jalur ini tidak ada yang berubah
8014209 untuk menginventarisasi siapa saja pemilik lahan itu kami akan berkordinasi dengan badan pertanahan nasional bpn
8014210 pelebaran lahan jorr di wilayah jakbar tidak terlalu banyak kendala sebab sebanyak 90 persen lahan yang akan digunakan adalah lahan fasilitas umum dan fasilitas sosial milik pemprov dki cuma sepuluh persen lahan yang milik masyarakat
8014211 targetnya awal 2010 sudah bisa digunakan dan telah tersambung dengan jorr w1
8014212 kami akan melarang mereka mengambil air tanah dan mewajibkan mereka memasang instalansi pembuangan air limbah ipal dan melakukan pemeriksaan cerobong pembuangan asap
8014213 the government has got to be seen to be helping ordinary people in these difficult economic times the price of oil is going up and therefore fuel prices are going up
8014214 my own view on the prospect of a windfall tax on energy companies is that the government will be cautious about introducing something which has an implicit retrospective element to it
8014215 a legalised raid on the companys bank accounts would be very unhelpful because it would scare off investors and also could make the cost of investment much higher and in the end that would end up on the customers bills
8014216 every 1m you take out of each company through this legalised raid is 1m they have to raise elsewhere

8014221 we knew it was a long shot but we owed it to ourselves to exhaust the possibility
8014222 we appreciate michael even considering ending his retirement he has a new career in front of him and we wish him nothing but the best as we all said when he announced his retirement michael was and is a great giant
8014223 there is a reason he went in the first round obviously
8014224 the guy he is playing behind strahan and osi and then we moved him to linebacker so obviously he is one of our top players on the team and he is going to show that he is a top defensive end in the league
8014225 we know we are a confident team and we are a playoff capable team and we have to go out and perform like it
8014226 the reason we took the underdog role last year was because everybody said it and we just went with it were not thinking like that this year we do have a chip on our shoulders and it grows more and more when somebody gives us something to feed off of
8014227 the only reason he will come back is if he wants to play
8014228 now the oil companies are placing their bets on john mccain bankrolling his campaign and gambling with our future
8014229 mccain has voted against tax credits for renewable energy 11 times and his only idea to solve our energy crisis is to keep doing what were doing as we watch prices go up and up and up
8014230 i have a better idea lets give them four more months and then elect barack obama
8014231 its amazing how many club officials read fire brand of the american league

8014235 beckett threw a side and did really well he threw 50 pitches and he was strong and hes ready to go friday im excited and because hes excited so are we
8014236 yes we wouldnt let him throw his side until he was symptom free
8014237 he probably couldve pitched the other day but we always try to do things the right way even when its not easy to do
8014238 did a bunch of core work today and had a strengthening exam with the trainers if everything goes like they think it will hell hit off the tee tomorrow hes doing very well

8014249 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8014250 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8014251 its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize

8014263 increasing speculation about diminishing central bank support in illiquid difficult to price asset backed security markets is likely to undermine investor risk sentiment and raise the level of write downs in the banking sector
8014264 participants may begin to price in liquidity limitations imposed by the ecb as the markets may be forced to absorb more collateral directly

8014270 thats no surprise because virtualization has had a huge impact on the way enterprises do disaster recovery
8014271 virtualization makes some aspects of backup and disaster recovery more difficult
8014272 it shops are still struggling with the steep learning curve
8014273 it shops need to get solutions that are finely tuned for virtualization
8014274 when you run a test it disrupts employees and customers
8014275 the tests cause the same pain to their customers as if they had a real disaster
8014276 last year the c level involvement on disaster recovery committees was 55 percent this year its 33 percent
8014277 we are seeking a declaration that klausners visual voicemail patent is invalid and that verizons system does not infringe the patent in any event
8014278 this is where i grew up and i love it i just feel proud to come from here let alone having anything named after me
8014279 i made a promise before the olympics and here it is
8014280 i just hope that loads of young people get involved in sport it neednt be to win it can just be for fun but get involved
8014281 i lived next door to her swimming teacher maureen pitchfork she was a very special person she got into the final of the 1954 commonwealth games she inspired the kids and im sure rebecca will do the same
8014282 shes a very good swimmer and the whole of our familys very proud of her
8014283 i dont know who did that but no ones disagreeing round here
8014284 shes such a genuine person is rebecca all us neighbours went round last night and she stayed on the street for ages signing autographs for the children
8014285 shed only just flown from beijing and shed had all the interviews at london airport and met gordon brown but she stayed out there until everyone had got what they wanted she didnt get tired or say stop ive had enough just like she didnt in the races she won
8014286 contained defamatory and untrue statements in respect of the club the chairman thaksin shinawatra an agent kia joorabchian and chief operating officer paul aldridge
8014287 ive been really disappointed with our performances this season and i have told the players that
8014288 i think we need to improve in every area in the second leg
8014289 we were lucky to leave belgium with a 0 0 when you see the goal that wasnt given and the penalty it could have been worse and we were not a threat at all but the positive is that it can be a wake up call the players must understand what a massive game this is
8014290 the first thing is silverware i like to talk about trophies that is the main thing
8014291 but the champions league is also about money and you have to take the two things together but we are here to win titles not to make money i always tell my players that if they win games they win trophies and then they will have higher wages and more money it is the same for the club
8014292 they are well organised they have good players and they have quality it will be a tough game for us because when a smaller club faces a top side they can play without pressure
8014293 that was their best game together so far the understanding between them was much better but the team didnt play well and all the attention went to carra jamie carragher and steven gerrard because of their goals
8014294 you have to put eight british players on the list and we had to decide before the first leg
8014295 so we considered who might be in the final and left javier and lucas out
8014296 well give it our best but if we somehow manage to get through it will rank as the biggest shock by a belgian side in europe for 40 years
8014297 all i keep hearing is how poorly liverpool are playing at the moment but when i looked at the premier league table on saturday night im pretty sure they were top with maximum points thats some poor start
8014298 as we have a very obliging director in john wardle the loan was made by him and it was repaid in two days it was never needed to pay wages
8014299 he has done ever so well from day one he has been a leader dunny is a local lad and everyone looks up to him
8014300 i have seen the lights from my flat when someone was practising
8014301 notts will be disappointed that the lights didnt come on but i think every england player was delighted to finish so early the wickets are good but the most pleasing thing is being part of this england bowling unit i think the wicket had good bounce from a good length but it didnt have any demons in it
8014302 apart from losing world cup semi finals this defeat is as disappointing as anything i have experienced the test series had some of the best moments in my career and this was right down there in terms of the lowest
8014303 robinhos time in spain has come to an end he is looking forward to being part of a new project
8014304 we have said over and over again that kaka will not be leaving
8014305 it was a remarkable victory one to be enjoyed because we are always on the receiving end of thrashings like that in the four or five years i have played one day internationals we have never hammered a team as convincingly as that before
8014306 it is brilliant the way the guys have turned things around since vaughanie and colly resigned i think i am very fortunate to have four guys bowling together at 90mph they fill the fielders with so much happiness i am sure that if previous captains had had them firing on all cylinders at the start of their campaigns im sure theyd have been all right
8014307 the key to this is not for us to gob off about this or anything because we havent won the series
8014308 i had breakfast with matty he is in a really good place at the moment he has turned up a different guy it has been a headache about wicketkeepers recently but lets hope he stays good because he is a hell of a batsman
8014309 the thing that i am trying to tell matty and drum into the young players is that it is really great to be on the top of a wave but you have to try and get that level where you are cool and calm and responsible to do and deliver day in day out i said to matty that it was an amazing catch but he had another job to do in 20 seconds
8014310 when you play like we did today people paid a lot of money for the tickets and they would have been very disappointed there wasnt a better game
8014311 the club is being run on sound football and business principles in order to develop a squad which can deliver success this season
8014312 no player would be bought or sold unless that helped to achieve that aim we are not interested in selling players who are committed to the club and essential to our first team squad if a player refuses to sign a new contract or is not crucial to the managers plans then we will look at offers on a case by case basis it is the only sensible way to build for the future
8014313 ive made my feelings known about transfers and we need to back up the squad if we can
8014314 can i ask what sort of advice and help you are providing
8014315 please advise and help me so that i understand whats going on here
8014316 why do i have to learn about this from asif after its all set up
8014317 we have maintained a public line that we are not involved in the politics or the deals
8014318 can i say that honestly if youre providing advice and help
8014319 ambassador khalilzad had planned to meet socially with zardari during his personal vacation but because zardari is now a presidential candidate ambassador khalilzad postponed the meeting after consulting with senior state department officials and zardari himself
8014320 zal has been a voice of strong criticism that goes way beyond u s policy of the government of karzai and that opinion reflects his personal view
8014321 this has been a problem going back two years on the pakistan account
8014322 the pakistan political situation is highly unstable right now and the last thing the u s needs is for it to become the central focus of that instability through accusations that it is propping up or scheming behind the scenes with one of the major political players
8014323 pakistani leaders are also guilty of putting too much attention on currying favor with u s leaders rather than focusing on governing their own country and dealing with the myriad of challenges there
8014324 he is the former ambassador to iraq and afghanistan his close relationship to the president has been acknowledged
8014325 you are a player and if another leader is looking to you for help and advice they have to assume it is coming from the upper echelons of the government
8014326 it is irresponsible to engage in that dialogue while you are a sitting official and taking an oath to be a representative of the u s government
8014327 no pasa nada podeis bajar lo que querais de la mula
8014328 were certainly in the process of stabilising in terms of housing although i wouldnt want to say were there yet what we can say with some level of certainty is that the sharp declines in home sales are behind us and were flattening out
8014329 its very much a reflection of whats been going on in the energy markets
8014330 confidence remains quite low principally because of concerns about employment prospects
8014331 its clear that it will still take some time to work through the downturn in housing
8014332 once housing prices stabilise that will signal a return to a housing industry that can contribute to economic growth
8014333 when i was younger i enjoyed books by both men and women
8014334 i generally enjoy a sock on both my left foot and my right
8014335 up your arse im old enough to say whatever i like
8014336 come on men white men men of my class are just better at this stuff
8014337 you never know which part of the internet youll need
8014338 which is why all the parts of the internet are on the iphone
8014339 it was unthinkable to keep the bridge shut until then given the pedestrian part is ready
8014340 too much importance to this architect who has already done a lot of damage
8014341 i feel as if we are structural engineers not theatre producers
8014342 weve got 20 cranes on hire from small ones to 300 tonnes
8014343 were going to use miles of unused shipyard for rehearsals in liverpool and were organising the closure of the mersey tunnel then theres the sound light water snow wind and flame elements to get right the only thing we cant control is the weather but it wont rain
8014344 after the sultans elephant we were inundated with calls from people who said we want one of those we became known as those elephant women but we didnt want to repeat ourselves besides royal de luxe were so fed up with being invited all over the world to perform the sultans elephant they just destroyed it
8014345 the fundamental difference is that liverpool has commissioned this and really wants it whereas london didnt know it wanted the elephant until we came along the danger is that when they realise the scale of whats going to happen they will start wanting it slightly less but you cant do something on this scale anything other than wholeheartedly
8014346 if a roundabout needs to be taken out it has to come out
8014347 when we were trying to put on the sultans elephant people kept saying youll never succeed they told us to do it in milton keynes or battersea park but for me it was always an incredibly political act to put it on in londons public spaces to say this work is as important as anything that goes on in a concert hall or theatre everyone at the department for culture media and sport had to trip over the elephant to get to work in the morning they couldnt ignore it we dont want to be any less visible in liverpool what were giving people is the chance to take back the city
8014348 were certainly in the process of stabilising in terms of housing although i wouldnt want to say were there yet what we can say with some level of certainty is that the sharp declines in home sales are behind us and were flattening out
8014349 its very much a reflection of whats been going on in the energy markets
8014350 confidence remains quite low principally because of concerns about employment prospects
8014351 its clear that it will still take some time to work through the downturn in housing
8014352 once housing prices stabilise that will signal a return to a housing industry that can contribute to economic growth
8014353 the ability to use either sql mapreduce or both to analyze a large data set on a common processing infrastructure means that new kinds of analysis can be performed without losing any of the power or ubiquitous support of sql
8014354 traditionally massively parallel databases were able to parallelize ordinary sql but had limitations when parallelizing more general programs whether written as user defined functions or a database programming language such as pl sql
8014355 in many cases these capabilities simply ran on a single node of an mpp database now analysts and developers can take advantage of the power of mapreduce from within ordinary sql by creating sql mr functions in java python r and more
8014356 good examples are bayesian machine learning approaches clustering algorithms and natural language processing

8014367 the government could get to the position of saying that looking at the overall economic development position of the country and the picture on energy use high speed rail is a sensible thing to do
8014368 if growth continues at its current rate then it could well be that we reach growth forecasts for 20 years time in 10 instead in which case all the capacity improvements planned in the rail white paper are exposed a lot sooner than expected
8014369 there is very little evidence that high speed rail links help regional performance
8014370 there is an argument for spending a lot more money on the existing low speed railway service there are not enough people making long journeys for high speed rail to make sense
8014371 i want to live in the kind of society that puts asbos behind us

8014374 prison didnt teach me nothing i just hung out with people who did crimes who could explain to me how to do that crime
8014375 in some ways if i find out they are all inside ill think yep i got the right people theyre all bad people but the best result would be that theyre all now in jobs and living happily ever after sadly i dont think youre going to find that certainly not about all of them
8014376 if i were to go back to being a section inspector now id like to think i could pre empt these things earlier the money needs to be spent on getting the kids off the streets and preventing them forming the gangs to start with
8014377 i believe the asbos were the right point for this situation
8014378 we gave them an opportunity to find a new way in life because were not sending them to prison its an asbo its got an expiry date
8014379 i was arrested for talking in court and all these times i did jail sentences for them because we were on the asbo
8014380 prison didnt teach me nothing it didnt resolve nothing i just hung out with people who did crimes who could explain to me how to do that crime
8014381 at that time i was angry like how are you putting an asbo on me i know ive done things but ive been convicted of them and punished whether ive done probation whether ive done community service the asbo is like another conviction on top of those
8014382 if its a crime its a crime if its not then youre taking away peoples rights
8014383 the police admitted during the case that the reason they had gone for an asbo was that they didnt have sufficient evidence to pursue the youths criminally to get the asbo all they had to do is prove using hearsay evidence that the youths were acting in a way that caused alarm or distress then they could pursue them for breach of an asbo this could be something as minor as shouting crossing the wrong street or speaking to the wrong person
8014384 we were acting with the backdrop of asbos as a way of getting round the criminal justice system
8014385 how can i get a job if you send that all around the area
8014386 theres no hope for me is there it just made me an outlaw in my area

8014401 we suggest strictly enforced government mandated daily dose limits for toxic metals in all dietary supplements and requirements that all manufacturers demonstrate compliance through independent third party testing

8014403 this is the first time genetic testing has been recommended for a common disease
8014404 using cascade testing we should be able to move to the point where we have identified the majority of people with fh in the long term future we will be able to find them all
8014405 they can be offered semi skimmed milk it is crucially important no children should ever start smoking if they have fh if they smoke it multiplies their risk by two and a half fold almost without exception children will require treatment with statins by 18 but very small numbers of children will need treatment earlier

8014409 we temporarily modify the activity in this area artificially from the outside
8014410 its a way to stimulate nerves in the cortex without having to open the skull and insert electrodes

8014472 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8014473 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk

8014476 you or i might think a hot dog that just goes with baseball we can always change our traditions to be healthful

8014487 there is only black and white there is no gray
8014488 this is an improper use of red hat trademarks in that the marks are being used a either as nouns or b to promote a good or service that is directly branded with red hat owned marks

8014512 the things which thou hast heard of me by many witnesses the command to faithful men
8014513 the office of preaching ought to be committed to those capable of filling it
8014514 not only is it the duty of bishops and priests to build the house of god whereby signified his faithful people but the people themselves who are called a captivity into jerusalem the vision of peace ought likewise to require ministry of the word from them that know how to preach
8014515 what shall we bishops say and care not to impart the word entrusted to us we see this married man who does not suffer himself to be hindered from preaching either by his worldly garb or his pressing occupations

8014529 superman didnt quite work as a film in the way that we wanted it to

8014532 people think that she could be too edgy and the edgy comes from bearing her arms for example women cover their arms well in part because many women dont want to show their arms because they are not fit michelle obama is fit and she puts her health first and you can see that
8014533 she has a real presence but shes not quite as aggressive as hillary clinton but shes a lot more vocal that laura bush
8014534 a strong woman is necessary to keep the house in order i think its all stereotypical really
8014535 a first lady would have to be strong so i dont think that she would be too strong as a first lady
8014536 theres a stereotype of strong black woman and if youre strong that means you are angry
8014537 she puts family first always even though barack obamas platform is change part of the change that i have witnessed is a refreshed commitment to very traditional family values

8014545 even when i was for hillary i didnt think that he was that bad a person hes activized sic a lot of people hes a new generation of leadership for this country and i think he has got a lot of great energy
8014546 there were issues in the campaign but those are behind us and we have to follow her lead first of all and supporting barack obama that fact that for the betterment of our country that is really what we are about

8014552 hmmm i said you know theres a story in the bible kind of like that
8014553 but the bible also says we shouldnt let the sun go down on our anger
8014554 maybe that means that after youve cooled down a while you should go back over to toms house and try to patch things up

8014577 this is a huge victory for bowhunting not only in virginia but quite likely nationwide the virginia supreme court reinforces four critical points that form the foundation of bowhunting in america first bowhunting in urban areas can be done safely without putting people or property at risk second individual property owners can use bowhunting to address deer damage and nuisance problems third wildlife is a public resource thats held in trust and managed by states in this case the virginia department of game and inland fisheries for the publics benefit and four individuals or a homeowners associations cannot usurp state authority or use the courts to shut down or interfere with a legitimate bowhunting program when people or groups violate these historical well established lines of authority and take actions based on personal opinions its going to cost them
8014578 were extremely gratified to win a ruling of such high stature this should set a strong precedent in virginia and elsewhere virginias long standing approach to urban deer depredation problems is to use bowhunting whenever possible bowhunters in reston were part of that solution and had a proven track record unfortunately the homeowners association went ahead and created their covenant even after they were advised they were exceeding their authority the facts were against them from the start maybe now theyve learned they cant make laws just because they dont like bowhunting just as importantly when local groups force bowhunters to go to the courts to restore our rights its going to cost them

8014619 learning the world is ultimately an old fashioned pulp story with added emotional intelligence in that sense its an entertaining nicely written update of something we might have read in a dog eared amazing anthology i have no problem with kind of fun i enjoyed the book on this surface an easy read a bit of fluffy amusement what learning the world emphatically is not is a startling and original addition to the sf canon of first contact or indeed any other on going discussion within the genre
8014620 like most stories an interesting premise unlike most stories the narrative kept jumping back and forth between multiple points in the story line usually without warning the result was to take what could have been a first rate hardboiled sf detective story and turn it into a hodgepodge of unorganized passages too bad some of the passages contained really powerful images of bio terrorism

8014622 isnt it a little alarmist and more than a little absurd equating fantasy edging sf out in popularity with a general decline of western civilization i mean i realize im one of those rare and bizarre readers that willingly and happily switches from fantasy to science fiction without causing any deep scars to my fragile reading psyche but i think moaning over rowling winning a hugo sounds more like internecine sour grapes than anything meaningful fantasy science fiction nurse novels theyre all just words on paper you know

8014660 what fantasy book are you going to find originality in anyway
8014661 for simplicitys sake lets say this debate is between two well defined groups which it isnt the literati and the laymen with the former impugning epic fantasy and the latter defending it
8014662 likewise laymen should acknowledge the limitations of their appreciation the fact that theres always more than what meets the eye the problem here however is that this is humbling and we tend to be conceited its far easier to call people pompous
8014663 that moorcock article is rubbish he apparently writes non fiction as badly as he writes fiction
8014664 the genre was started by terry brooks i dont think anyone has damaged its reputation
8014665 i never thought fantasy would become a place where i could actually have to say moorcock is now underrated
8014666 ink is a sequel but its the subsidiary characters of vellum who take centre stage so its a bit of a shift in perspective rather than a direct continuation of the main narrative of vellum in the same way that vellums two volumes tell individual stories that of phreedom and thomas messenger in one seamus finnan in the other but build up into a wider narrative ink breaks down into two volumes hinters knights and eastern mourning but it also closes off the wider story arc of the book of all hours that is opened up in vellum
8014667 i really like this particular series thrillers about the british secret service for protecting us from the lovecraftian horrors that lurk beyond the universe as told from the point of view of the more than somewhat geekish bob a hacker whos fallen into the british civil service and cant escape theyre fun to write although not always easy humour and horror make an interesting mixture to balance out

8014689 once those skyscrapers had looked linear and symmetrical until the plague made them grow madly sprouting bulbous protrusions and tangled leprous appendages the buildings were all dead now frozen into the shapes which seemed calculated to induce disquiet slums adhered to their sides lower levels lost in a scaffolded maze of shanty towns and ramshackle bazaars aglow with naked fires
8014690 a figure stood there majestically silhouetted in the glare the man was garbed in a black anklelength cloak and a vaguely defined helmet the light making it resemble a halo cast around his head his profile was split diagonally by a long smooth stick which he gripped two handedly
8014691 the komuso stepped into the darkness what looked like a kendo stick was only his shakuhachi a traditional music instrument with well rehearsed rapidity he slid the thing into a sheath concealed behind the folds of his cloak then with imperial slowness he removed the wicker helmet the komusos face was difficult to make out his hair was brillaintined slickly tied back in a scythe shaped tail his eyes were lost behind sleek assassins goggles infared sensitive facets dully catching the rooms tinted light

8014694 corallary 2 the best science fiction is as good as the best fiction in any field
8014695 what i had to face the very bitter lesson that everyone who wants to write has got to learn was that a thing may in itself be the finest piece of writing one has ever done and yet have absolutely no place in the manuscript one hopes to publish
8014696 i dont have a sense of a so called ideal reader and certainly not of a readership that terrific entity i write for the page
8014697 our society and our literature and our culture are being dumbed down and the causes are very complex im 73 years old in a lifetime of teaching english ive seen the study of literature debased theres very little authentic study of the humanities remaining my research assistant came to me two years ago saying shed been in a seminar in which the teacher spent two hours saying that walt whitman was a racist this isnt even good nonsense its insufferable
8014698 i have always imagined that paradise would be a kind of library
8014699 dont say the old lady screamed bring her on and let her scream
8014700 everywhere i go im asked if i think the universities stifle writers my opinion is that they dont stifle enough of them
8014701 the only reason for being a professional writer is that you just cant help it
8014702 i dont mind someone telling me that they think a book is shallow if they can substantiate that argument by pointing out its flaws
8014703 im all in favor of keeping dangerous weapons out of the hands of fools lets start with typewriters
8014704 the commercial genre which has developed from tolkien is probably the most dismaying effect of all i grew up in a world where joyce was considered to be the best anglophone writer of the 20th century i happen to believe that faulkner is better while others would pick conrad say thomas mann is an exemplary giant of moral mythic fiction but to introduce tolkiens fantasy into such a debate is a sad comment on our standards and our ambitions is it a sign of our dumber times that lord of the rings can replace ulysses as the exemplary book of its century some of the writers who most slavishly imitate him seem to be using english as a rather inexpertly learned second language so many of them are unbelievably bad that they defy description and are scarcely worth listing individually terry pratchett once remarked that all his readers were called kevin he is lucky in that he appears to be the only terry in fantasy land who is able to write a decent complex sentence that such writersalso depend upon recycling the plots of their literary superiors and are rewarded for this bland repetition isnt surprising in a world of sensation movies and manufactured pop bands that they are rewarded with the lavishlifestyles of the most successful whores is also unsurprising to pretend that this addictive cabbage is anything more than the worst sort of pulp historical romance or western is however a depressing sign of our intellectual decline and our free falling academic standards
8014705 a classic is a book that has never finished saying what it has to say
8014706 the decline of literature indicates the decline of a nation
8014707 i love fantasy because the world is a place of great beauty and horror and fantasy is the only way i can fully express what i know about this contradiction fantasy and world building then is not escapist for me or i imagine for other world creators instead its about realistic people its about the fact that this place we live in is full of unexpected marvels and things that are strange and alien even if we dont always realize it
8014708 i write for the same reason i breathe because if i didnt i would die
8014709 a corollary supply side this time can be found in the current state of fantasy bad fantasy drives out good writers arent stupid they can see what sells derivative hacks get the large contracts promotions and pushes for their series work while truly original ground breaking stand alone novels either languish in obscurity or dont get published at all its a rare writer thats strong enough to swim against such tides many stop writing fantasy altogether while weaker writers or those with bills to pay give in and join the herd never underestimate the power of avoiding a day job
8014710 fantasy writing is no more inherently inessential than any other variety and no more inherently escapist either what makes writing escapist is not a matter of whether or not it involves magic but whether or not it involves something meaningful fantasy writing is if anything increasingly relevant because it involves building and representing the whole world fantasy worlds sci fi worlds hidden gnostic horror worlds this proliferation of worlds seems to me to be bound up with the extent to which the world has become immersed in trademarked representation
8014711 i think its undignified to read for the purposes of escape after you grow up you should start reading for other purposes you should have a more complicated relationship with fiction than simple entrancement if you read for escape you will never try to change your life or anyone elses its a politically barren act if nothing else the overuse of imaginative fiction enables people to avoid the knowledge that they are actually alive
8014712 real seriousness in regard to writing is one of two absolute necessities the other unfortunately is talent
8014713 so why is sff as a literary genre doomed to failure
8014714 our sci fi slut mother is a crack whore who gives blowjobs for ten dollars a pop thats what genre fiction does thats what pulp fiction does it gets down on its knees unzips your fly and uses all the sensual skills of its slick tongue to give you a few minutes of loveless but ecstatic pleasure
8014715 of all that is written i love only what a person has written with his own blood
8014716 in with that leaden and literal style so perfectly abhorrent to the literary book buyer
8014717 but given that the pleasure of fantasy is supposed to be in its limitless creativity why not try to come up with some different themes as well as unconventional monsters why not use fantasy to challenge social and aesthetic lies
8014718 some editors are failed writers but so are most writers
8014719 whats most striking about these authors is that i can identify each one simply by reading a piece of their fiction without their name attached to it this is a little like being blindfolded and knowing the sound of your mothers voice or the way your father coughs no one else laughs like your best friend does you can pick her laughter out of a room full of laughing strangers but i cant really tell the difference between some writers and others these are the writers whose sentences are very sturdy very normal very efficient and emotionally safe these are the writers who make competent narratives that are easily forgettable id name a few but ive already forgotten them
8014720 too many writers and readers prefer their literature spoon fed to them in portions similar to the last with the same smells and colors served to them on the same worn dishes and accompanied by the same polite conversation
8014721 write a novel if you must but think of money as an unlikely accident get your reward out of writing it and try to be content with that
8014722 the sad fact is we cannot ignore commercial genre work some people would like to they maintain that they are not affected by the cookie cutter blobberies that others call novels i envy their views ignorance is after all bliss i cannot see it that way every time i try to look past commercial genre work my view is blocked by an appalling stack of terry goodkind novels roughly the size and weight of mt mckinley they say you cant see the forest for the trees well you cant see around a stack of goodkind novels either commercial genre work is the antithesis of true speculative fiction it is the shadow of moby dick floating beneath the waters ready to swallow the industry like so much plankton
8014723 the man who does not read good books has no advantage over the man who cannot read them
8014724 back in the winter at 5 30am when i didnt want to get up and train on some cold and dark morning id still make myself snap on the light and look inside my swimming cap athens is stitched on the inside id get up then id grab my bag and head for the pool ive been doing that 365 days year after year i cant remember the last day i didnt train thanksgiving christmas day new years day i havent missed one of em for years and every single day i got that word athens running right round my head

8014735 you can read feast by light produced by the burnt jordan piece two birds with one stone
8014736 when the author goes so far out of their way to not write a clich that the book ceases to be a telling of a story and sharing of the imagination and instead becomes a self absorbed and self indulgent exercise of ego stroking contrivance and pretension
8014737 elitism with the points and authors you mention would seemingly go like this and i will answer it as i go
8014738 does the fact that i dislike baseball beer microsoft professional wrestling popular music shakespeare mass transit whatever make me an elitist

8014749 estremisti il segretario del circolo un maggiorenne che pare abbia provveduto a convincere alliscrizione e allattivismo altri ragazzi
8014750 nel mio provvedimento non esistono riferimenti diretti o indiretti allappartenenza del ragazzo ad alcun partito o circolo non ho mai citato il prc n parlato di una sua militanza comunista non capisco come si possa montare una cosa simile
8014751 laddove scrive si segnalano le carenze genitoriali della madre dei due minorenni e la vita sregolata del 16enne
8014752 lirregolare frequenza scolastica i mancati rientri a casa seppure con il beneplacito materno e la frequentazione di luoghi giovanili ove diffuso luso di sostanze alcoliche e psicotrope

8014754 i comunisti sono unorganizzazione estremista solo perch fuori dal parlamento ci vogliono fuori legge

8014764 trade unions of the foreign invested enterprises in china have firmly centered on production and business operation to conduct activities and have given support to enterprises in their operation and management according to law have educated workers to observe factory rules and regulations and discipline organized workers to launch labor emulation campaigns and aroused the enthusiasm of the workers for running the enterprises well so as to contribute to the sound development of the enterprises
8014765 this successful experience in setting up wal mart unions is groundbreaking in that we have discovered a new line of thinking it not only will influence other foreign and private investors to quickly abide by the law to allow unions to be established it also brings to trade unionists a new mission following the new logic in setting up unions new adjustments in union work will be needed be it in methods in organizational structure ways of identifying backbone activists down to how to use union funds

8014859 old technologies have a habit of fighting back when new ones come along this is not surprising because they often have an enormous amount of design engineering and production knowledge invested in them
8014860 i believe that cities are all about difficulty theyre about waiting for the bus for the light to change for your order of chinese take out to be ready theyre about frustration about parking tickets dogshit potholes and noisy neighbors theyre about the unavoidable physical and psychic proximity of other human beings competing for the same limited pool of resources the fear of crime and its actuality these challenges have conditioned the experience of place for as long as weve gathered together in settlements large and dense enough to be called cities and as it happens with our networked ambient pervasive informatic technology we now have or think we have the means to address some of these frustrations in economic terms these technologies both lower the information costs people face in trying to make the right decisions and lower the opportunity cost of having made them so you dont head out to the bus stop until the bus stop tells you a bus is a minute away and you dont walk down the street where more than some threshold number of muggings happen in fact by default it doesnt even show up on your maps and you dont eat at the restaurant whose forty eight recent health code violations cause its name to flash red in your address book and all these decisions are made possible because networked informatics have effectively rendered the obscure and the hidden transparent to inquiry and theres no doubt that life is thusly made just that little bit better but theres a cost theres always a cost serendipity solitude anonymity most of what we now recognize as the makings of urban savoir faire it all goes by the wayside and yes were richer and safer and maybe even happier with the advent of the services and systems im so interested in but by the same token were that much poorer for the loss of these intangibles its a complicated trade off and i believe in most places its one were making without really examining whats at stake

8014868 this stylish witty and enlightening portrait of contemporary iran brilliantly captures the too often misunderstood character of the people and their complex paradoxical and changing nation
8014869 in 2004 and 2005 i spent several weeks in iran as a journalist and in 2007 i spent almost two months in tehran working on what was to become the manuscript

8014871 let me tell you a story about hijab reza shah made the chador for women and turban for man illegal in mid 1930s he wanted fascist as he was to emulate turkeys kemal ataturk who not only had banned the fez and the veil but had even changed the turkish script from arabic to latin rendering the vast majority of turks illiterate overnight to force his people into a modern which he saw as european would
8014872 during the early days of islamic revolution women were harassed and sometimes beaten and imprisoned for not wearing proper hijab but the exact same things for opposite reasons occurred on the streets of tehran less than fifty years earlier
8014873 i refer to some of these failures whether they be the imprisonment of student protesters or feminist activities or the crackdown on civil liberties but this book is not about the injustices of irans political system or more important the sometimes outrageous abuses in that system which many courageous iranians such as lawyers journalists and activists living in iran fight against every day rather my hope is that this book through a combination of stories history and personal reflection will provide the reader a glimpse of iran and iranians often secretive and suspicious of revealing themselves that he or she may ordinarily have the opportunity to see

8014885 we are looking at the most effective uses for the vaccine and are currently assessing the strengths and weaknesses of offering it to over 18s including cost effectiveness
8014886 there is no evidence that extending the vaccination to over 18s would deter women from having smear tests receiving the vaccine could in fact provide an opportunity to remind women of the need for screening

8014996 just because the lot was recalled doesnt mean that all the meat was contaminated
8014997 even though one has consumed some of the contaminated meat it doesnt mean they will display any of the symptoms
8014998 they say it doesnt really cause illness in a healthy person

8015005 the willingness with which our young people are likely to serve in any war no matter how justified is directly proportional to how they perceive the veterans of earlier wars were treated and appreciated
8015006 many people say they support the troops and they really mean it but it needs to mean more than putting a sticker on the back of your car i dont think we actually support the troops we contract out the business of national security to approximately 0 5 percent of the population and then we turn away i think theres something fundamentally immoral about that
8015007 the social contract between this country and those it sends to war is broken as a country we have never been able to answer one fundamental question what america owe to those who serve

8015025 its a trend were excited about but not completely surprised about if you look at the installed base and attached rate of customers to the xbox
8015026 third party publishers are looking at the same things we are and they want to put games into as many peoples hands as possible
8015027 the lack of a dominant console means its too difficult for software makers to give up on a console
8015028 with the ps3 or xbox 360 you dont have a clear winner like the playstation 2 or playstation were

8015055 feels like the obama campaign ran against and systematically dismissed his administrations accomplishments
8015056 and he feels like he was painted as a racist during the primary process
8015057 sen obama would go a long way towards healing these wounds if he were to specifically praise the accomplishments of the clinton presidency in a line or two during his speech on thursday
8015058 there may be parts of the speech that arent going to get a lot of applause but ive got to say what i believe will get our country back on the right path

8015080 we have been doing it so long that we pretty much just take one play at a time take one game at a time and go out there and perform
8015081 i take last year as my rookie season because it was the first year that i played just about the whole season
8015082 i had ups and i had downs i did good things and i did bad things i just take a little bit from both and try to apply it to this year and just make sure i dont make the same mistakes
8015083 this is where i make the team or not so i have to go out there and it gives us the opportunity to show the coaches that we deserve to be out there i dont look past anybody
8015084 the guys that arent going to be playing in this game are focusing on oakland but right now we are getting ready for arizona at the same time the regular season is close by and we understand that we are going to go out here focused on this game on friday and then move on from there
8015085 we just go out there and try to effectively run as a unit
8015086 you are playing in a game competing and trying to execute and that is what you are going to do regardless of when it is
8015087 i think we have made some strides since the start of camp
8015088 we talked about our rush defense we improved in that area three point five per rushing attempt after giving up 5 5 last year so that is a big difference it is 11 guys working together we do have several guys at different positions but that is how they get some experience by going out there and playing and these preseason games help and hopefully it carries over to the season

8015125 he sent a personal message asking her to get on board
8015126 he has always admired her music and thinks she is the perfect choice because of her unique appeal to black and white voters
8015127 i think the emergence of southern rap might have been the final nail in the coffin as far as white artists trying to fit into a black radio format
8015128 the problem is that barack obama cant afford to be associated with any kind of miscegenation
8015129 its not like the 1980s when you could turn on the black radio station and hear shit like

8015171 we are very concerned about the way mr pitts was treated by wal mart

8015180 salman was not feeling well on his arrival on sets so he was resting for a while before starting his shooting but then as he started vomiting continously he decided it was pack up time for him for the day he left the sets immediately to go home and take rest it was a result of a stomach upset as he was heard saying so to the production members
8015181 only a few days of shoot for yuvraj is left as the film is almost complete but now with salmans participation being a must in it the shooting has been completely stopped until he gets well and ready to shoot it may now happen in next month only
8015182 police say they were contacted by five victims about alleged sexual abuse police say an investigation found that griffith was sexually abusing the victims during counseling sessions in the church office
8015183 i have to go to the jail and find out whats going on
8015184 ive informed him of what i know and he said well figure things out when he gets back
8015185 i spoke with him this evening and he told me about being arrested and about the charge but thats it the details are troubling
8015186 he had talked to the pastor about a web site he had created
8015187 the pastor visited with the man every time he went to the store at one point the pastor asked for the mans telephone number
8015188 again the man didnt think much of it because it was coming from a pastor
8015189 in the time i knew him he was a great guy and a great minister
8015190 it was most unfortunate to have heard about his past
8015191 though entirely apart from active priestly ministry the resigned priest observed conscientiously the circumstances of a discreet retirement in mobile
8015192 those in his parishes those who benefited from his homilies could tell he was a scholar
8015193 i was very saddened by the fact that he was removed from active ministry because of those accusations
8015194 the man had a vision to get it done and he did a wonderful job for our church
8015195 while he was here in montgomery we knew him as a very fine priest
8015196 failed to take steps to terminate or reduce his abuse
8015197 i didnt give them the right kind of family situation i regret that
8015198 how can they hold me responsible for his non inclusion in the show i didnt even know he was being considered to be a part of the show dont they understand that i am just a host of the show apart from hosting it nothing related to the show is of any concern these guys are trying to grab publicity and mileage using my name and politicizing the issue
8015199 i was extremely upset when i heard that they had burnt my effigies this is a sign of total disrespect in a democratic country like india i felt as if they were burning me though it hurt me i also felt silly about the entire thing was i really the cause of all this
8015200 when she jade goody decided to participate in the show i was accused of roping her in to raise the trp ratings of the show i feel such loose talk needs to be avoided
8015201 well i only took up the job as a host because i had very well understood the format and it required just very few days from me the host of this show has a very significant role to play as he is the only outsider whom the house inmates interact with also i realized i would be the first heroine to play such an important part in the show
8015202 notts will be pretty disappointed that the lights didnt come on but every england player and fan will be delighted how the game has gone
8015203 it was a great performance and we have to enjoy wins like that
8015204 the most pleasing thing is we are bowling as a unit and everyone is enjoying their cricket we have to go and try and seal the series at the oval on friday
8015205 it was a spectacular remarkable victory and one to be enjoyed
8015206 the recipe for success is hard work and the boys are doing the simple things better than the other team but i am not going to go overboard we havent won the series yet
8015207 music is in my blood my father is a well known ghazal singer in delhi and i have trained under him before moving to mumbai about eight years back
8015208 right from my childhood i wanted to be a ghazal singer like my father i used to come to mumbai during vacations earlier but my voice was completely different then since i used to sing only ghazals
8015209 i took their advice and landed in the city of dreams with my bags my taste and singing style changed completely after i came to mumbai i started training under kalyanji for light music that was during my adolescence and my voice cracked while training i had no choice but to go back to delhi because i just could not sing
8015210 viju shah gave me my first break in the film beti number 1 i struggled a lot during those days used to visit every music director and sing in front of them
8015211 it was for the film haasil and won a lot of acclaim from all quarters
8015212 the song baat samjha karo became a hit within a few days of the song being released shankar called me again for a dummy recording when the song was being recorded none us thought it would be such a big hit shankar told me that it was a dummy recording but aditya chopra producer of the film heard the recording and liked my voice and decided to retain that
8015213 alisha chinoi sung the song so well and the visual appeal of the song was so much that my singing went unnoticed
8015214 i sang for a number of films like golmaal malamal weekly neil and nikki and zindagi rocks my first solo hit however is from the film naqaab ek din tere rahon mein and that is when people really started noticing me and realized that i could sing romantic numbers as well
8015215 i feel very happy about the fact that most directors recommend my name to the music directors for example even imtiaz ali director of jab we met suggested my name to pritam there are a number of other such instances
8015216 i was dying to work with a r rehman and my name was recommended by a senior voice over artiste brij bhushan i got a call from mr rehmans office a few days after that and that is how the jodha akbar song happened it was truly a memorable moment for me when i sung this song
8015217 when i went for the recording i was so nervous that my voice was trembling when i reached his recording studio it was such a nice ambience and mr rehman is cool like a cucumber i dont think i will ever forget the experience he first made me do a few scratch recordings and then recorded a qawali in my voice
8015218 i received congratulatory messages from a number of people in the industry for my rendition including sonu nigam and shaan
8015219 ill meet a guy and start dating and well have sex and then in a few months hell try to get me to lose weight and do this or
8015220 id walk through hell in a gasoline suit to play baseball
8015221 n o honesto cientificamente dizer que existe ou n o a essa presen a de consci ncia
8015222 we were willing to pursue all legitimate means to ensure that outcome as people do all the time in washington

8015226 that our activities would not be funded by revenues derived from gambling activities
8015227 message from tony rudy dont share it please however we should take his advice
8015228 we need to get together and draft a response for lou
8015229 i just chatted with ralph we are going to have to go on the air nationally on radio we must get the conservatives back on this or we are doomed
8015230 i think we should get weyrich to get like 10 groups to sign a letter to denny and armey on gaming bill
8015231 while i am no fan of gambling i see this bill as a violation of states rights and i am looking to prevent this encroachment
8015232 we were told by house leaders to bring it up on the suspension calendar so you wont have to deal with all these amendments
8015233 there was lucky louie out front hi fiving with some lobbyists
8015234 im just sick about what the republican leadership is doing with regard to gambling
8015235 goodlatte and tauzin asked tom delay what they needed to do to get his vote and tom said to talk to you
8015236 i have chatted with ralph and we need to get the funding moving on the effort in the 10 congressional districts
8015237 please get me a check as soon as possible for 150 000 made payable to american marketing inc this is the company ralph is using
8015238 where are we you got the check no are things moving
8015239 1 yes they got it 2 yes all systems go
8015240 congressman robert aderholt voted with them in support of hr 3125 with the law the gamblers want on horse and dog racing
8015241 certainly our displeasure was relayed on up the chain so to speak
8015242 once we started talking about taking out our guys i got worried
8015243 tony would say to members oh youre getting phone calls on this i better go tell the whip lou sheldon sending a letter is not going to do anything unless you have somebody on the inside tony exaggerated to leadership how backing the bill could hurt those members
8015244 i wasnt aware the money was coming from them elottery
8015245 i dont think i ever saw the check it came in and we paid the bill for some of the printing
8015246 lisa rudy worked for us for six months six to nine months to organize groundwork for a conference
8015247 spoke up and noted that the bill could cost as many as four house seats at that point there was silence not even rep dick armey r texas our previous opponent said a word
8015248 policy beat politics once again maybe the american system isnt really that bad the good guys won
8015249 we have never neglected our core gamers we still have developers working on popular core gaming franchises but we need longer to complete these games approximately two to three years these games are not ready to launch in early 2009 but are being worked on by all development teams
8015250 we concentrate to make others multiplataform games without the microsoft legancy and now we have more freedom
8015251 gary i guess i should have known i would find you here how have you been
8015252 oh not directly actually im on staff with president mccain and im just accompanying him here i just meant that in a way i have you to thank for him being here in the first place
8015253 youre mistaken there i didnt do anything to get the president elected my organization was backing another person for the position
8015254 yeah obama right thats what i was talking about positioning him so well in the beginning but botching it in the end and playing so carelessly with your cover my people felt that we just needed a few extra bases covered
8015255 putting in such an obvious ringer having such a transparent cover story about his origins what is he an alien a cyborg you must have gone with a cheap one hes fine following a script but he shows his gears when he interacts with others and could you be more obvious in your method of positioning him for power using a borg
8015256 jeri is no longer a borg she has been separated from the collective for years now and she didnt do anything to reveal us
8015257 no one suspects anything untoward everything thinks her timeline history is pure fiction
8015258 which brings up another point you couldnt disguise those directional antenae on the sides of his head better than that you might as well have had him wear mickey mouse ears everywhere he went
8015259 be that as it may its no longer of any consequence since he didnt get elected truth be told he was a bit of a long shot from the start it was just believed that he posed the best chance to avert a nuclear war luckily mccain has done wonders on that front
8015260 what are you doing around mccain anyways i dont see how this has anything to do with your crusade
8015261 oh but it has everything to do with that tell me have you looked into the technology behind the shield
8015262 of course we checked out the technology its effective and safe for humans and life in general i wouldnt be supporting it if it werent
8015263 youre right of course it is effective and safe more than safe in fact
8015264 the signature of the field generated by the shield did it remind you of anything
8015265 the field was tested and shown to be perfectly safe for life forms
8015266 but did it remind you of any other fields perhaps like the one surrounding baku
8015267 remember on my timeline its the younger generation against the older for years it was a crime to be over twenty one years old weve fought to gain the right to live the right not to be killed because of our age and weve won that right but as long as we keep having a younger generation the threat will always be there
8015268 youve gone mad youll give up space flight no one will want to leave the planet for fear of getting old youll all be stuck here
8015269 is that so bad well remain growing wiser and more sensible as our population ages it did wonders for baku think what well be like in a thousand years
8015270 but you cant condemn the unborn to never have existed think of the multitudes that will never be due to this course of action it will change all history
8015271 gary how can a person who never existed have a right to life ill grant you right up to conception in that argument but no earlier thats taking pro life just a bit too far
8015272 but how can you make this decision for all mankind without even their knowledge its not right
8015273 youre going to lecture me on taking actions that affect my race without its knowledge thats rich coming from you or dont you remember launching a certain nuclear weapon a few years back
8015274 thats not the same no one stopped living because of my actions many people alive today might not have been if i hadnt done what i did
8015275 of course none of this would have been possible without you making way for mccain to be president hes in on the whole thing of course
8015276 you lie i have a full psychological profile on mccain he would never betray his entire race like this
8015277 you did something to him thats why he gave away the technology you have him your control somehow his honor is unimpeachable six years as a pow prove that you couldnt have convinced him to betray the human race otherwise what did you do supplant him with a doppleganger brainwash him use some variant of a vulcan mind meld
8015278 somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have
8015279 if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
8015280 but if youre like me and you got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home then you might have a different perspective
8015281 and by the way the answer is john mccain has seven homes
8015282 put simply financial returns from wine have not met our expectations mr johnston said yesterday
8015283 global trading conditions for wine continue to be competitive but the category remains in solid growth
8015284 we expect the beer market to remain resilient he said
8015285 the economy will struggle to keep going when it cant get the skills that it needs
8015286 to match the average wage a man earns in 12 months in the financial year working full time ordinary hours a woman has to work an extra 54 days or a total of 14 weeks to earn the same equal opportunity for women in the workplace agency director anna mcphee said
8015287 where do you think she would look best as a goddess doll or adorning an art quilt
8015288 is welcome but it is trivial compared to the plunge over the past year

8015293 im also wondering whether the web curious will allow news of the album to spread more or less by itself
8015294 a friend who relocated to california from ny said she missed hearing all the odd variety of music that was played around the office here
8015295 you can make major chords sound sad but you can never make minor chords sound happy
8015296 people will still be playing drumming when your work is a period curiosity
8015297 look we can do very nicely thank you on our own
8015298 the rest arguably it made a huge mistake buying alcan at best it bought itself a business that subtracts from its fabulous iron ore metrics
8015299 short energy compared with bhp on its own and arguably too long aluminium but it would have a much better balance of commodity hedges against both futures
8015300 i think london is going to be an amazing opportunity for kids to get involved with sport i dont know about the funding issues but you dont need huge amounts of funding ive been on hardly any at all a pool is a pool no matter what i just think its important for kids to get involved

8015306 there are a bunch of puerto ricans living up there
8015307 does it matter she was standing on the street outside my window
8015308 hey maybe they just didnt bother putting a verbose version of the installer in place because silent means say nothing right instead of run in the background and dont disrupt the user
8015309 one of these times im going to turn on logging in my firewall and see if i can figure out what ip its calling home to and then block that sucker in the firewall for good and permanent so that all attempts by acrord32 exe to phone home fail

8015316 its a shame too because the most recent version of the browser plugin was a substantial improvement at least on windows and linux its worse than useless on os x though since it only works in safari which is also the only browser that doesnt need it at all
8015317 the pink slab of cardboard that they called gum in packs of baseball cards we ate it anyway but good lord i cant imagine what it would taste like now with refined adult taste buds

8015321 and yes kids have horrible horrible taste not everything goes better with ketchup you little freaks
8015322 im surprised no ones mentioned american cheese i used to eat boatloads of the stuff but the very smell let alone the taste of it now makes me curse the nation that invented it
8015323 but vienna sausages in that pull top can with that ugh
8015324 if you throw them in the fridge that jelly gets jelly ier and better then you can mix it with hot sauce and smear it on the sausages one for fish one for you
8015325 it is taboo to put ketchup on a chicago hot dog some hot dog stands dont even stock the condiment
8015326 i wonder if that creepy secondhand bookseller guy has any more copies of black label penthouse yet
8015327 ketchup on those a bad thing seriously has the world gone mad

8015333 this is a good time in the life of pittsburg state university
8015334 enrollment is healthy relationships with alumni and the community are strong we have accomplished some major projects and others are well on their way we have excellent leaders in key positions across campus who are prepared to continue the progress pittsburg state university has made
8015335 koeta and i have discussed this at length and we believe the time is right to begin the orderly change of leadership at pittsburg state university
8015336 serving as president of pittsburg state university has been one of the greatest honors of my life i cant imagine a more satisfying endeavor
8015337 it has been a great joy to work with thousands of bright talented and energetic students they are a daily reminder of why pittsburg state university exists and the value of what we do
8015338 koeta has been a full partner in our service to pittsburg state university and her love of pittsburg state and the psu family is as deep as my own
8015339 under toms leadership pittsburg state set student enrollment records witnessed impressive campus construction projects and experienced incredible increases in private giving
8015340 we are certainly thankful that tom will continue to serve as pittsburg states president through the end of the academic year
8015341 the good thing is that last i checked nobody s forcing anybody to buy this stuff
8015342 the declaration click for text fails to address racial and ethnic crimes committed by sudan tramples international human rights guarantees on free speech places islam above all other religions and targets israel alone implying that it is uniquely racist
8015343 regrettably durban ii is looking more and more like the original durban debacle of 2001
8015344 failed to review any african countrys actions and its inflammatory provisions now threaten to derail the world conference in april
8015345 not be party to an anti semitic and anti western hatefest dressed up as an anti racism conference
8015346 by failing to review the performance of african countries on racism and related intolerance the conference is ignoring its primary mission and squandering a golden opportunity to help africas many victims of racism and xenophobia
8015347 apart from un watchs plenary speech on sunday neither the conference nor its final declaration addressed the sudanese governments crimes against humanity in darfur including the ethnic killings of at least 200 000 black africans mass rape and the displacement of over 1 million men women and children
8015348 moreover the text fails to review the xenophobic attacks that recently broke out in south africa the leading organizer of the abuja meeting and the overall durban process where foreigners notably from zimbabwe and mozambique were targeted in may during a wave of anti immigrant attacks in which at least 62 were killed and tens of thousands were displaced
8015349 nor does the text review the ethnic crimes in kenya this year that killed 1 000 people displaced another 600 000 and burnt down 40 000 buildings in an outburst of tribal bloodletting millions of african victims of xenophobia present and future are ill served by the conferences grant of impunity for racial or ethnic crimes committed in african countries
8015350 inflexibly clinging to free speech in defiance of the sensitivities existing in a society and with absolute disregard for religious feelings
8015351 mirror efforts by islamic states at the un human rights council to insinuate islamic anti blasphemy prohibitions into international law yet un expert on religious freedom asma jahangir and other international human rights experts have expressly opposed defamation of religion resolutions which seek to alter international human rights law by defining religions instead of individuals as the bearers of rights
8015352 the language goes far beyond the recognized norms for balancing prohibitions of racial hatred with respect for free speech which is the lifeblood of democracy if the right to express ones beliefs to question the dogmas of the day in society law politics art science and yes religion is to be restricted by the feelings and sensitivities of others this will mark the end of free speech as we know it
8015353 seeks to impose a hierarchy of religions placing adherents of islam above all others
8015354 this is contrary to the basic principles of equality enshrined in the un charter and the universal declaration of human rights and undermines the very premise of the global struggle against racism
8015355 reiterat ing its concern about the plight of the palestinian people under foreign occupations
8015356 why is a non african situation mentioned in a declaration about africa one that references neither sudans racist killings nor any other country in africa
8015357 the special reference to the palestinian issue implies that israel is practicing racism
8015358 portraying israels conflict as racial is more than political mischief its an attempt to dehumanize israelis and their supporters as uniquely evil we regret that african states today allowed the extreme political agenda of certain middle eastern governments to undermine their legitimate cause
8015359 it is only one paragraph that mentions the palestinians so the interest of israel was never badly damaged

8015361 we know from observing crisis situations on other campuses that there is no single perfect way to communicate important information to every constituency on and off campus
8015362 but texting is a great option for immediate communication we hope this is the money we spend that we never need to use
8015363 campus safety is both a top priority and an ongoing process at pittsburg state

8015383 the idol of today pushes the hero of yesterday out of our recollection and will in turn be supplanted by his successor of tomorrow
8015384 basing a workers exposure on 45 years on the job is an archaic workplace model
8015385 ok lets role play suppose i just selected new benefits for my employees what skills might i need to convince them that these are good benefits
8015386 well youd probably want to actually have the skill to select good benefits
8015387 its essential to have an elevator speech a prepared pitch in case you run into the ceo on the elevator if the ceo is in the elevator and you have nothing to say it will be a long elevator ride so you have to be ready

8015390 conflict of interest could arise when an employer with a self funded benefit plan e g a self insured health plan also acts as the claims administrator for the plan

8015644 thats the bet our founding fathers were making all of those years ago that our individual destinies could be tied together in a common destiny of democracy that government depends not just on the consent of the governed but on the service of citizens thats what history calls us to do loving your country must mean accepting your responsibility to do your part to change it
8015645 i will ask for your service and your active citizenship when i am president of the united states

8015693 our focus is on us and what we choose to do and how our performance is going to be
8015694 most noticeably right now were anxious to see what kind of improvement this team demonstrates and also how they progress and develop this will be our first opportunity
8015695 other than i know some of the guys across the sideline
8015696 ive never been wild about playing guys that ive worked with there are an awful lot of folks up in maine that i still stay in touch with that were very very good people to me when i was up at that university
8015697 our goal is to play with cohesion play clean not hurt ourselves and give ourselves a chance
8015698 i thought he exhibited growth and practiced well we wish him all the best he leaves here in good standing
8015699 i have great respect for their program jack cosgrove is an outstanding coach who has done a great job with the program there this is no new thing for them to travel to a bcs conference place i remember distinctly when they were playing nebraska and it was 15 7 in the fourth quarter that got my attention theyve been on the road theyve played in big stadiums im sure theyll come in here revved up and ready to go and we expect a tough contest
8015700 we had a good feel for who shonn was and what he was before he got here and hes had a good month
8015701 paki omeara has elevated his play a great deal and our newcomers have done a nice job as well im pretty confident that were going to play well at the running back position based on what weve seen were pretty optimistic that were going to be productive in the backfield and thats good to see
8015702 hes had a good camp i dont know if hes quite at optimal condition right now but hes close hes worked hard his attitude is great hes a mature guy and were excited about getting him back
8015703 jack cosgrove is an outstanding coach who has done a great job with the program there this is no new thing for them to travel to a bcs conference place i remember distinctly when they were playing nebraska and it was 15 7 in the fourth quarter that got my attention theyve been on the road theyve played in big stadiums im sure theyll come in here revved up and ready to go and we expect a tough contest
8015704 i think its fair to say that because of the competition well probably play a couple different players at several positions
8015705 well continue the evaluation until the picture becomes a little bit more clear now its just a matter who does the best in game situations well keep watching
8015706 i think there is a pretty good chance that both will play
8015707 they both performed well in camp for the most part were playing better with both guys they both have the capability to move our offense and thats a good thing
8015708 were making progress were getting there but were not clicking just yet
8015709 we can mope about it or we can hopefully use it to motivate us its just going to be good to start playing again its been our plan to forge ahead here
8015710 a wolf wrapped in monks robes a devil with a human face and a beasts heart
8015711 our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter
8015712 once again looking back today it is extremely difficult to justify such a label dr kings opponents utterly missed the essence of his message and there has been an obvious reconsideration of their tactics against him
8015713 well were irish catholic today we were in my grandparents time and we always have been
8015714 i was a hillary supporter and saw in hillary the same thing barack obama the experience and knowledge she couldve been president on day one obama needs on the job training
8015715 the glory of young men is their strength and the beauty of old men is the grey head
8015716 he chose the young because they were strong and the old because they knew the way
8015717 you had that dream about me because i am mad just not at you
8015718 it would depend on whether the russians simply stop being positive which probably wouldnt have much of an effect
8015719 if they start being negative if they start using their influence on central asian governments to get them to stop cooperating with nato and stop supporting supply lines to afghanistan across their territory then it could be a more serious problem
8015720 get ready for a long cold winter in georgia with social chaos around the corner
8015721 e verybody who disliked him disliked the united states i think that has changed with his resignation
8015722 top using us pakistan as a transit line to afghanistan and then were sort of stuck
8015723 we can no longer wait for someone to lodge a complaint before we intervene too many tenants are suffering in silence because of fear or financial difficulties we want to get inside these properties on a regular basis to ensure properties are well maintained and remain in good condition
8015724 i dont want him beau going but i tell you what i dont want my grandson or my granddaughters going back in 15 years and so how we leave makes a big difference
8015725 the hope is that mr biden will help mr obama overcome a major political problem the growing perception that he is unprepared to lead a nation at war
8015726 i voted against war in iraq before i voted for it
8015727 dropped its insistence that american contractors remain immune from iraqi law
8015728 i remember when i was pregnant and considering a third abortion i went to daddy king her grandfather he told me thats a baby not a blob of tissue unfortunately 14 million african americans are not here today because of legalized abortion its as if a plague swept through americas cities and towns and took one of every four of us
8015729 we should hire three or four colored ministers preferably with social service backgrounds and with engaging personalities the most successful educational approach to the negro is through a religious appeal we do not want the word to go out that we want to exterminate the negro population and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members
8015730 before you go to bed tonight more than 1 500 babies will be killed in a black womans womb
8015731 eeuw what the heck is that gross looking thing on your lip
8015732 to hold that the political branches may switch the constitution on or off at will would lead to a regime in which they not this court say what the law is
8015733 revealed what is common knowledge that the military commissions are fatally flawed and do not adhere to major aspects of the rule of law
8015734 in pursuit of justice prosecuting terrorism cases in the federal courts
8015735 from epic mega trials such as those involving the first attack on the world trade center 1993 and the east african embassy bombings 1998 to individual pre emptive prosecutions focused on prevention
8015736 lies in the extensive record of actual prosecutions going back to the early 1990s and continuing to this day in federal courts around the country
8015737 prosecutors have invoked a host of specially tailored antiterrorism laws as well as long standing generally applicable federal criminal statutes to obtain convictions in terrorism cases
8015738 have consistently exercised jurisdiction over defendants brought before them even those defendants apprehended by unconventional or forcible means
8015739 the disarray that plagues the military commissions at guantanamo with abundant litigation as well as dissension within the military command structure does not bode well for proposals to create a brand new system from scratch
8015740 we have seen how the terrorists dispose of prisoners civilians at that beheaded in front of live cameras and how hezbollah disposed of israels two captured soldiers recently returned in coffins where is the human rights first report on that
8015741 it certainly is a byproduct if you will of the economic situation business is down shopping is down
8015742 we have seen a slowdown in what has been set out at the curb people arent buying as much or buying the large ticket items
8015743 for the month of june the atlantic county utilities authority collected about 2 500 fewer tons of trash than it did for june 2007 theyre seeing the same trend in july
8015744 from 2006 to 2007 the total amount of waste handled in virginia dropped 1 8 million tons to about 23 4 million tons
8015745 we hear from the waste industry that it does appear to be mostly related to the economy
8015746 if you look at the trash tonnage it correlates with the economy
8015747 in 2007 after the housing market had cooled and subprime mortgage defaults had risen the towns trash totals slipped to 1 448 tons
8015748 waste generation rates are related to prosperity and increases in economic activity
8015749 once again the 40 3 percent year to year decrease in the median price of a home was an all time record surpassing the previous record set in june with a 37 9 percent decrease
8015750 since the statewide median remained in the 585 000 595 000 range through august of last year the market will continue to experience significant year to year adjustments through august even if the median price holds steady over the next few months
8015751 the statewide median was last in the 350 000 range in early 2003
8015752 year to year increases in the number of transactions ranged from a 6 7 percent increase in the san francisco bay area to a 176 5 percent increase in the riverside san bernardino region
8015753 the survey highlights obamas vulnerability on the question of his readiness to lead the nation less than half of the registered voters polled think the first term illinois senator has the right experience to be president while 80 percent believe mccain a four term senator does

8015758 before i formed you in the womb i knew you before you were born i dedicated you
8015759 to just say i dont know on the most divisive issue in america is not a clear enough answer for me
8015760 there is a moral and ethical element to this issue
8015761 if you believe that life begins at conception then i cant argue with you on that because that is a core issue of faith for you

8015763 at a time when the industry is suffering a skills shortage this wage increase will help retain experienced workers as well as attracting newcomers to the industry

8015765 crews when they arrived a short period of time after they were told there was a child inside
8015766 there were initially five children ranging from age two up to 17 and four of them got out but unfortunately the two year old toddler did not
8015767 their grandmother made a lot of valiant efforts in getting the kids out she suffered burns and smoke inhalation trying to get the kids out
8015768 currently in the legislation it says you have to have a smoke alarm on every floor in a house what were saying is you should have smoke alarm in every bedroom
8015769 crews when they arrived a short period of time after they were told there was a child inside
8015770 weve been resting this team since sorianos come back you look at us and were pretty fresh just about everywhere it should keep us fresher but you never know about this business all your best laid plans can go awry i hope they dont but you never know in this business put it this way id rather be in this position knowing that were as rested as we possibly can be than having to have gone full throttle the whole way
8015771 i dont know whats happened here in the past i read about it the least i can i told these kids that before the season started in spring training my first message was youre going to be asked a lot of questions about whats transpired here i said look this team stands on its own merit the talk is about this year and this year only and i think weve adhered to that all year
8015772 im signed through next year so theres plenty of time
8015773 but this will be my last job i can tell you my last managing job i can stay in baseball as a consultant
8015774 id love to be able to throw a red hanky or a green hanky or something
8015775 imagine being able to throw something on the field and you cant be ejected
8015776 this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially
8015777 if it takes too long this is not like football youve got a pitcher thats standing there i tell you what itll probably be used a ploy by some managers just to freeze the pitcher for five or six minutes and cool him off if hes going really well baseballs got to look at this thing carefully but i want my red hanky
8015778 unidrive supplies axles to car manufacturers such as ford and with the reduction in demand they are forced to let go of 40 workers from september
8015779 unidrive used to employ over 500 workers now it is 150 and after september it will reduce to 110
8015780 unidrives decision underscores the need for trade measures and industry policy that covers the entire automotive industry inclusive of component suppliers
8015781 as major car companies reduce production the demand for parts decreases and the components and subsidiary suppliers are at threat

8015795 what again has impressed me about michael is in the discharge of this office as commander in chief of our armed forces hes never regarded that as a ceremonial role
8015796 his ongoing continuing passion is the well being of the men and women of australia who wear our nations uniform
8015797 i complete my term as commander in chief satisfied that our armed forces although relatively small are well led trained and equipped

8015820 first god himself who sits enthroned in yonder heavens is a man like unto one of yourselves that is the great secret i am going to tell you how god came to be god we have imagined that god was god from all eternity god himself the father of us all dwelt on an earth the same as jesus christ himself did you have got to learn how to be gods yourselves no man can learn you more than what i have told you
8015821 for i know that god is not a partial god neither a changeable being but he is unchangeable from all eternity to all eternity
8015822 for behold god knowing all things being from everlasting to everlasting
8015823 behold i say unto you he that denieth these things knoweth not the gospel of christ yea he has not read the scriptures if so he does not understand them for do we not read that god is the same yesterday today and forever and in him there is no variableness neither shadow of changing
8015824 jesus christ is the same yesterday and today and forever
8015825 thus saith the lord the king of israel and his redeemer the lord of hosts i am the first and i am the last and beside me there is no god
8015826 god is not a man that he should lie nor a son of man that he should change his mind
8015827 before the mountains were brought forth or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world even from everlasting to everlasting thou art god
8015828 ye are my witnesses saith the lord before me there was no god formed neither shall there be after me
8015829 before me there were no mighty ones formed neither shall there be after me
8015830 there are sins that men commit for which they cannot receive forgiveness in this world or in that which is to come
8015831 youve done very well in your keeping of the word of wisdom therefore ill heal you
8015832 thats a good start now go and undo all the sins youve committed clean up your life clean up your thoughts do some worthy work and when you are finished come back to me and ill appoint some people to see about forgiving you
8015833 therefore no one will be declared righteous in his sight by observing the law rather through the law we become conscious of sin but now a righteousness from god apart from the law has been made known to which the law and the prophets testify this righteousness from god comes through faith in jesus christ to all who believe there is no difference for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by christ jesus
8015834 therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ
8015835 what then shall we say that the gentiles who did not pursue righteousness have obtained it a righteousness that is by faith but israel who pursued a law of righteousness has not attained it why not because they pursued it not by faith but as if it were by works
8015836 i do not set aside the grace of god for if righteousness could be gained through the law christ died for nothing
8015837 for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast
8015838 i know you couldnt pay the whole debt here let me pay it too
8015839 hands off i can change myself into what you i want

8015848 when our father adam came into the garden of eden he came into it with a celestial body and brought eve one of his wives with him he helped to make and organize this world he is michael the arch angel the ancient of days about whom holy men have written and spoken he is our father and our god and the only god with whom we have to do

8015852 this is a huge milestone adding these stores increases our distribution by over 500 and xeko is now able to reach even more fans across the country
8015853 we know that to effect lasting positive change for our planet we must engage children the next generation of eco leaders
8015854 were coming into a new era an era of consciousness among business leaders with the power to make a real difference and while many hr departments are racing to install environmental managers to their executive team those executive teams are still getting the most direct help from specialists

8015858 i would look for toys online for my daughter hibba and find mainly video games and electronic toys before starting my business selling pedal cars ride on toys and child furniture i never considered wooden toys and i didnt consider the damage virtual toys are doing to the imagination of our kids

8015860 warm whiskers generous gift to our event was so wonderful providing the children with a friend as well as a very special therapy tool
8015861 so many parents commented that this was a gift that they could really use to help their children and teens not only with the emotional aspects of growing up with arthritis but with the ever present need to ease sore joints those labs were met with smiles that meant so much to us and are sure to last
8015862 we have an incredible level of respect for the arthritis foundation and the organizers of the conference who are so committed to helping these families to be able to contribute in our own way with gifts so perfectly suited to the needs of the kids was exciting and empowering
8015863 to be able to offer even the smallest level of comfort and relief to these kids who are forced to deal with pain at such a young age is what running your own business is really about participating on a personal level in this conference makes us that much more committed to making this kind of outreach a significant part of our companys mission
8015864 i heartily recommend kubit2me as an interactive tool to promote social language skills
8015865 younger students enjoy the lil scholars edition and can hardly wait to get their hands on the bright soft surface older students enjoy the now youre talkin edition these colorful cubes are flexible tools to use with students aged 3 to 18 for teachers and clinicians working with typically developing children or a special needs population this is a must have
8015866 i really love to engage youth in intelligent conversations about values ideals and goals many of the questions in the kubit2me games get these ideas out in the open
8015867 as a working mother of preteen and teenage boys its a challenge to find the time to have meaningful conversations with my kids and more of a challenge to get them to open up
8015868 when we played kubit2me now youre talkin we all really listened to each other not only did we have a blast playing this game but we also learned some interesting things about each other

8015875 as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time
8015876 and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition and st augustine said at three months we dont know
8015877 i understand and this is like maybe 50 years or something like that so again over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
8015878 the current teaching of the catholic church on human life and abortion is the same teaching as it was 2 000 years ago
8015879 from the beginning the catholic church has respected the dignity of all human life from the moment of conception to natural death
8015880 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion
8015881 while catholic teaching is clear that life begins at conception many catholics do not ascribe to that view the speaker agrees with the church that we should reduce the number of abortions she believes that can be done by making family planning more available as well as by increasing the number of comprehensive age appropriate sex education and caring adoption programs the speaker has a long proud record of working with the catholic church on many issues including alleviating poverty and promoting social justice and peace
8015882 that debate in our church has not morphed but changed over a thousand years
8015883 it always is viewed by the church as something that is wrong but theres been gradations of whether it was wrong you know from venial or mortal sin as we catholics say and versions of it
8015884 its been pretty clear thats been automatic moment of conception
8015885 a code pink protester shown on video being shoved to the ground by a police officers baton and later hauled away remains in jail on a charge of interfering with an arrest but should be released tonight code pink officials say

8015890 at a time when pharmac cant find funding for sufferers of breast cancer heart disease high blood pressure and other serious problems that they can find funding to subsidise flavoured condoms
8015891 this is simply about funding sexual behaviour that shouldnt be at the cost of the taxpayer
8015892 sexual behaviour that shouldnt be at the cost of the taxpayer

8015896 once fire crews got inside the house they tragically recovered the body of a child every firefighter wants to save everyone its just so tragic
8015897 i could see it was going to be bad thats when i went outside they were hosing the place down and there was not much else anybody could do
8015898 it appeared to be a big fire but there was no danger to the houses next door there was one truck with about six hoses going
8015899 the grandmother did look distraught the family and everybody was just standing around so i offered accommodation to the son if they needed it but they said they were fine
8015900 weve got a reasonably friendly street and i always talk to them grandmother and children the children stay at the house quite regularly
8015901 i know the church is the only true church on the face of the earth i know joseph smith was a prophet of god and i know that president so and so is a true prophet i rarely heard testimonies about jesus christ that he is our savior
8015902 is this basis enough to discard friends values a whole way of life
8015903 just be honest with yourself do what you know is right
8015904 do you want to talk to president kimball would it help
8015905 it sounds like your mind is already made up before you even talked to me
8015906 elder hudson by the authority of the melchezedic priesthood and in the name of jesus christ i command you not to leave the mission
8015907 im not telling you elder and i say it in the name of jesus christ amen
8015908 apostasy and other conduct unbecoming a member of the church
8015909 only way to heaven is through the church only the priesthood have the way rubbish
8015910 thou shalt not kill even though life at home was bad suicide would be breaking that commandment amp for some reason i didnt want to offend god
8015911 a man can get closer to god by reading the book of mormon than any other book
8015912 that is the beauty of the temple because each time we go we learn something new about the mysteries of god president mckay went thousands of times in his life amp it wasnt until he was in his old age that he understood what it was all about
8015913 thats just terrific when im reaching my 80s then maybe ill have a clue but until then ill just go through the motions of dressing amp re dressing like some barbie doll with silly hand motions and being
8015914 i have something i need to tell you amp i dont know how youre going to take it
8015915 bishop i love my husband because i trust him but if i found out that even though he treated me good 95 of the time amp was only unfaithful to me 5 in our marriage the 95 of
8015916 man who lived on a planet with many wives amp became a god of his own world
8015917 why did you allow me to be deceived why why why
8015918 there isnt a damn thing true about the church but its the best place to raise a family
8015919 chucky cheese tokens in the plate when its passed i try amp get something positive out of the message
8015920 no one fucks with me i just want to go home
8015921 my whole body had shut down i was in absolute terror
8015922 in my mind it wasnt just that they were trying to scare me i thought that they were going to kill me
8015923 a number of shots were fired from a vehicle into a house at blackwood road merrylands
8015924 there were a number of other people in the premises family presumably but i dont know
8015925 its early stages at the moment we will still be doing a lot of forensic ordinary old police detective work
8015926 its a bit early for a motive but obviously someone didnt like somebody sometime it could even be the wrong house
8015927 i have not been informed of any subsequent allegations by a proper authority
8015928 we view allegations of any sexual misconduct towards children with grave concern we are concerned for the wellbeing of any child whether they now be adult or not who may have been subject to abuse
8015929 we strongly support the process of thoroughly investigating allegations of sexual misconduct towards children
8015930 during our inquiries we have obtained comprehensive statements from a number of people who have assisted with the investigation
8015931 i can understand it would be very difficult to come forward and discuss such matters but i would reassure anyone with information that a phone call to police would be dealt with in the strictest confidence
8015932 if it mormonism was working for your family what was the problem
8015933 if only i had fully accepted the doctrine of the lds church then i could have become a god
8015934 see things as they truly are and not just as i believed them to be
8015935 if i were just a better person if i just had more faith etc etc i would have peace i would be happy etc etc
8015936 there aint no way this stuff happened in real life
8015937 julie when you come up from the waters of baptism you will be as clean and pure as the white driven snow
8015938 restitution for loss of chastityalso far reaching is the effect of loss of chastity once given or taken or stolen it can never be regained even in a forced contact such as rape or incest the injured one is greatly outraged if she has not cooperated and contributed to the foul deed she is of course in a more favorable position there is no condemnation where there is no voluntary participation it is better to die in defending ones virtue than to live having lost it without a struggle
8015939 its okay you are forgiven it isnt your fault etc
8015940 what an un godly hour of the morning to have to get up and go to church
8015941 use it up wear it out make it do or do without
8015942 she can only use one hand for scooting how fast can she be
8015943 dude why are all the stairways slanted hard to the left seems really dangerous especially with no handrails
8015944 well the more dangerous the task the more care is taken
8015945 are you saying people are less likely to fall down the stairs if they are forced to pay attention
8015946 basically yeah also people cant sue you if your house is obviously a fun house injuries are a big part of the fun
8015947 wo unto the liar for he shall be thrust down to hell
8015948 well you asked for this meeting do you not care to get to the specific problems and what created them
8015949 if you continue in this direction then you will loose your family forever and you will be divorced in two years
8015950 ask the most receptive party on the offense to give a sincere closing prayer and ask god that truth be revealed to each one there
8015951 dont trust your feelings yea right that burning in the bosom in d amp c section 9 is for translation purposes only pray for truth
8015952 it seems that way i wish i had recorded the meeting so you could review it on your own you could hear that he never answered the facts that were mentioned such as the doctrinal changes j s s promiscuity before the everlasting covenant of marriage was revealed the fact certain sins are not covered by christs atonement the statement that j s said that he was greater than christ the fact j s sounds more like david koresh than samuel a real prophet he only spoke to you and pulled your heart strings
8015953 bill i am ready to leave where do we go from here
8015954 i believe that the church is true but i do not know that it is true
8015955 i know that jesus is the christ and that he lives i know that joseph smith was a modern prophet and that the book of mormon is true i know that gordon b hinckley is also a modern prophet and holds the keys for this dispensation
8015956 he knows the gospel is true but he does not know that he knows it
8015957 i have a message as you continue to seek god you will find him and you will become great
8015958 ive heard that before that would be nice but so far i just strike out with god
8015959 yes you and brad thompson my elders quorum president in 1977 and steven broadbent my elders quorum president in 1978 and george pace my stake president and elder daniel lemire fellow missionary say so the others have all been wrong
8015960 before a man can be found he must first be lost salvation begins with our recognition of our need for god
8015961 blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of god
8015962 when you serve your mission you will have a correct understanding of the gospel
8015963 be not forgetful to receive strangers for in so doing many have received angels unawares
8015964 how can you go up and talk to a woman you dont know i could never do that
8015965 as a missionary i knocked on thousands of doors of people i did not know this is no different
8015966 we worship the father and him only and no one else we do not worship the son and we do not worship the holy ghost i know perfectly well what the scriptures say about worshipping christ and jehovah but they are speaking in an entirely different sense the sense of standing in awe and being reverentially grateful to him who has redeemed us worship in the true and saving sense is reserved for god the first the creator
8015967 should not strive for a special and personal relationship with christ
8015968 everyone who is sound spiritually and who has guidance of the holy spirit will believe my words and follow my counsel
8015969 i shall summarize the true doctrine in the field and invite erring teachers and beguiled students to repent there are yet others who have an extensive zeal which causes them to go beyond the mark their desire for excellence is inordinate in an effort to be truer than true they devote themselves to gaining a special personal relationship with christ that is both improper and perilous i say perilous because this course particularly in the lives of some who are spiritually immature is a gospel hobby which creates an unwholesome holier than thou attitude in some instances it leads to despondency because the seeker after perfection knows he is not living the way that supposes he should another peril is that those so involved often begin to pray directly to christ because of some special friendship they feel has been developed in this connection a current and unwise book which advocates gaining a special relationship with jesus contains this sentence because the savior is our mediator our prayers go through christ to the father and the father answers our prayers through his son this is plain sectarian nonsense our prayers are addressed to the father and to him only now i know that some may be offended at the counsel that they should not strive for a special and personal relationship with christ
8015970 in which book do you learn to call me father
8015971 i will never join a church that has been racist
8015972 after i died these things would be made clear to me
8015973 mormonism must stand or fall on the story of joseph smith he was either a prophet of god divinely called properly appointed and commissioned or he was one of the biggest frauds this world has ever seen there is no middle ground if joseph was a deceiver who willfully attempted to mislead people then he should be exposed his claims should be refuted and his doctrines shown to be false
8015974 lord did not come to joseph smith but sent his angel to inform him that he should not join any religious sect of the day for they were all wrong
8015975 do you suppose that god in person called upon joseph smith our prophet god called upon him but did not come himself
8015976 the book of mormon must be either true or false
8015977 witnesses of the book of mormon who handled the plates and conversed with the angels of god were afterwards left to doubt and to disbelieve that they had ever seen an angel
8015978 manner of construction was like unto the temple of solomon and the workmanship thereof was exceeding fine
8015979 stop looking for archaeological evidences for the book of mormon for there is none
8015980 the first myth we need to eliminate is that the book of mormon archaeology exists titles of books full of archaeological half truths dilettante on peripheries of american archaeology calling themselves book of mormon archaeologists regardless of their education and a department of archaeology at byu devoted to the production of book of mormon archaeologists do not insure that book of mormon archaeology really exists no book of mormon location is known biblical archaeology can be studied because we know where jerusalem and jericho were and are but we do not know where zarahemla and bountiful or any location for that matter were or are
8015981 most amazing recitals he would describe the ancient inhabitants of this continent their dress their mode of traveling and the animals upon which they rode their cities their buildings with every particular their mode of warfare and also their religious worship this he would to with much ease seemingly as if he had spent his whole life among them
8015982 whence comes the young prophets ability to give these descriptions with as much ease as if he had spent his whole life with these ancient inhabitants of america not from the book of mormon which is as yet a sealed book to him these evening recitals could come from no other source than the vivid constructive imagination of joseph smith a remarkable power which attended him through all his life it was as strong and varied as shakespeares and no more to be accounted for than the english bards
8015983 and this i know because the lord hath said he dwelleth not in unholy temples but in the hearts of the righteous doth he dwell
8015984 for behold by the power of his word man came upon the face of the earth which earth was created by the power of his word wherefore if god being able to speak and the world was and to speak and man was created
8015985 men who are preaching salvation say that god created the heavens and earth out of nothing the reason is that they are unlearned in the things of god god never had the power to create the spirit of man at all
8015986 translated from the papyrus by joseph smith a translation of some ancient records that have fallen into our hands from the catacombs of egypt the writings of abraham while he was in egypt called the book of abraham written by his own hand upon papyrus
8015987 the little volume of scripture known as the book of abraham will someday be recognized as one of the most remarkable documents in existence it is evident that writings of abraham while he was in egypt of which our printed book of abraham is a copy must of necessity be older than original text of genesis
8015988 there has been a lot of things written and suggestions made trying to justify the fact that not one mention of abraham not his name not his faith nothing at all is on this papyri only pagan beliefs and instructions on afterlife as believed in egypt
8015989 it may be helpful to suggest that the book of abraham represents simply the product of joseph smiths imagination
8015990 to a professional historian for example the recent translation of the joseph smith papyri may well present the potentially most damaging case against mormonism since its foundation yet the powers that be at the church historians office should take comfort in the fact that almost total lack of response to this translation is an uncanny proof of frank kermodes observation that even the most devastating acts of disconfirmation will have no effect whatever on true believers perhaps an even more telling response is that of the liberals or cultural mormons after the joseph smiths papyri affair one might have well expected a mass exodus of these people from the church yet none has occurred why because cultural mormons of course do not believe in the historical authenticity of m ormon scriptures in the first place so there is nothing to disconfirm
8015991 the woman you claim for a wife does not belong to you she is a spiritual wife of brother joseph sealed to him i am his proxy and she in his behalf with her children are my property you can go where you please and get another
8015992 joseph opened the door slightly and snapped the pistol six successive times afterwards i understood that two or three were wounded by these discharges two of whom i am informed died
8015993 adam is god and father and the only god with whom we have to do
8015994 now hear it o inhabitants of the earth jew and gentile saint and sinner when our father adam came into the garden of eden he came into it with a celestial body and brought eve one of his wives with him he helped to make and organize the world he is michael the arc angel the ancient of days about whom holy men have written and spoken he is our father and our god and the only god with whom we have to do every man upon the earth professing christians or non professing must hear it and will know it sooner or later the earth was organized by three distrinct characters namely eloheim yahovah and michael these three forming a quorum as in heavenly bodies and in organizing element perfectly represented in the diety as father son and holy ghost
8015995 i believe in the principal of obedience and if i am told that adam is our father and our god i just believe it
8015996 how much unbelief exists in the minds of the latter day saints in regard to one particular doctrine which i revealed to them and which god revealed to me namely that adam is our father and god our father adam helped to make this earth it was created expressly for him he brought one of his wives with him who is he he is michael he was the first man on the earth and its framer and maker he with the help of his brethren brought it into existence
8015997 adam is the only god with whom we have to do
8015998 i have learned by experience that there is but one god that pertains to this people and he is the god that pertains to this earth the first man that first man sent his own son to redeem the world
8015999 some revelations are from god some revelations are of man and some are of the devil
8016000 adam is known as the ancient of days in this capacity he will yet sit in formal judgment upon ten thousand times ten thousand
8016001 the body in which he performed his mission in the flesh was sired by that holy being we worship as god our eternal father jesus was not the son of joseph nor was he begotten by the holy ghost he is the son of the eternal father
8016002 god the father is a perfected glorified holy man an immortal personage and christ was born into the world as the literal son of this holy being he was born in the same personal real and literal sense that any mortal son is born to a mortal father there is nothing figurative about this paternity he was begotten conceived and born in the normal and natural course of events for he is the son of god and that designation means what it says
8016003 each word is to be understood literally only means only begotten means begotten and son means son christ was begotten by an immortal father in the same way that mortal men are begotten by their mortal fathers
8016004 the fleshly body of jesus required a mother as well as a father therefore the father and mother of jesus according to the flesh must have been associated together in the capacity of husband and wife hence the virgin mary must have been for the time being the lawful wife of god the father inasmuch as god was the first husband to her mary it may be that he only gave her to be the wife of joseph while in this mortal state and that he intended after the resurrection to again take her as one of his own wives to raise up immortal spirits in eternity
8016005 the great messiah who was the founder of the christian religion was a polygamist the messiah chose to take upon himself his seed and by marrying many honorable wives himself show to all future generations that he approved the plurality of wives under christian dispensation the son followed the example of his father and became the great bridegroom to whom kings daughters and many of the honorable wives were to be married we have also proved that both god the father and our lord jesus christ inherit their wives in eternity as well as in time
8016006 it is true that many of the christian churches worship a different jesus christ than is worshipped by the mormons
8016007 a god above the father of our lord jesus christ
8016008 if jesus christ was the son of god and god the father of jesus christ had a father you may suppose that he had a father also where was there ever a son without a father hence if jesus had a father can we not believe that he had a father also
8016009 every man has a natural and in our country a constitutional right to be a false prophet as well as a true one
8016010 i am going to tell you how god came to be god we have imagined and supposed that god was god from all eternity i will refute that idea and take away the veil so that you may see
8016011 god himself was once as we are now and you got to learn how to be gods yourselves the same as all gods have done before you
8016012 is there a god beside me yea there is no god i know not any
8016013 ye are my witnesses saith the lord and my servant whom i have chosen that ye may know and believe me and understand that i am he before me there was no god formed neither shall there be after me
8016014 i am the lord and there is none else there is no god beside me
8016015 if there arise among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreams and giveth thee a sign or a wonder and the sign or the wonder come to pass whereof he spake unto thee saying let us go after other gods which thou hast not known and let us serve them thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet or the dreamer of dreams for the lord your god proveth you to know whether ye love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul ye shall walk after the lord your god and fear him and keep his commandments and obey his voice and ye shall serve him and cleave unto him and that prophet or that dreamer of dreams shall be put to death because he had spoken to turn you away from the lord your god
8016016 for unto us a child is born unto us the son is given and his name shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty god the everlasing father the prince of peace
8016017 art thou not from everlasting o lord my god mine holy one
8016018 choose you this day whom ye will serve but as for me and my house we will serve the lord
8016019 as each of these persons is a god it is evident from this standpoint alone that a plurality of gods exists
8016020 and god said let us make man in our image
8016021 this is about good enough for a good snack so thats my catch for today

8016035 in addition members saw continuing downside risks to this outlook particularly reflecting possible further deterioration in financial conditions
8016036 although measures of core inflation might well edge up later this year given the pass through to final goods prices of earlier increases in the prices of energy and other inputs most participants anticipated that core inflation would edge back down during 2009
8016037 the fed is on hold and the minutes verify that thats ultimately good news for equities and bad for bonds we may not see it today but thats been the message they have been sending in the past month or so
8016038 a number of participants worried about the possibility that core inflation might fail to moderate next year unless the stance of monetary policy was tightened sooner than currently anticipated by financial markets
8016039 inflation is probably not that big of a problem this go around because you dont have the wage price spiral you are not seeing growth in wages thats the bottom line

8016061 this is gross violation of free speech and a most disgraceful thing that the ucu activists concerned have done it reflects very badly on the union as a whole whether or not the action has official sanction as a trades unionist i have made a formal complaint to the brendan barber general secretary trades union congress universities and colleges union telephone 020 7670 9729 if an activist in a union that espouses anti racism takes her information on world affairs from a known white supremacist then it is in the public interest that this be made public knowledge
8016062 i have taught sessions on web searching web use and how to establish the provence and authenticity of information this has made me crucially aware of how difficult it is to set out rules or even guidelines for avoiding errors

8016068 early in the morning our song shall rise to thee
8016069 people have gotten into the practice of following private religious hunches rather than learning of god from his own word
8016070 people have ceased to recognize the reality of their own sinfulness which imparts a degree of perversity and enmity against god to all that they think and do it is our task to try to introduce people to this fact about themselves and so make them self distrustful and open to correction by the word of christ
8016071 i dont think this issue has to resolved in terms of when life begins that is a theological question or scientific question i as a christian have a belief that the potential for life is sacred at the moment of conception but i also believe that it is not decisive in determining who makes the decision that difficult in questions like abortion

8016073 no hay duda de que el festival internacional de santander ha adquirido a lo largo de sus 57 a os una identidad singular y que ha logrado ya una forma de ser reconocida por su prestigio y la coherencia de sus anuales convocatorias ininterrumpidas el festival es ya una forma de ser que ha venido siendo desde hace 57 a os ha configurado sus perfiles y ha venido gestando una identidad que hoy es inconfundible e inevitable como referencia cultural

8016078 this summer as we go to china fca is issuing a challenge to christian coaches wives from across the nation to stand in the gap and pray pray for the safety and strength of those competing and serving for the favor of those athletes and coaches who are christians and for those who have never heard the name of jesus or given their hearts to him
8016079 god is universal and god is love and no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
8016080 we continue to be completely and utterly dependent upon him for all that we have and all that we do one of the biggest needs that china has is for the training of leaders and more resources to give to the people who are already believers
8016081 home at last good on you john how exotic how much more unpacking do you have to do
8016082 college presidents from about 100 of the nations best known universities including duke dartmouth and ohio state are calling on lawmakers to consider lowering the drinking age from 21 to 18 saying
8016083 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
8016084 nobody told me life was going to be this hard
8016085 bringem back alive a healing plan for those wounded by the church
8016086 somebody will find a way to take it too seriously
8016087 humor is a rubber sword it allows you to make a point without drawing blood
8016088 a sadducee a pharisee and a roman walk into a bar
8016089 did you know how upset the pharisees were when they heard what you said
8016090 really i had better go get that straightened out the pharisees are some important guys
8016091 forget them they are blind men leading blind men when a blind man leads a blind man they both end up in the ditch
8016092 what is he doing eating and drinking with crooks and sinners
8016093 who needs a doctor the healthy or the sick im here inviting outsiders not insiders an invitation to a changed life changed inside and out
8016094 johns disciples are well known for keeping fasts and saying prayers also the pharisees but you seem to spend most of your time at parties why
8016095 when youre celebrating a wedding you dont skimp on the cake and wine you feast later you may need to pull in your belt but this isnt the time as long as the bride and groom are with you you have a good time luke 5 29 34 msgb
8016096 you have to be willing to do some soul searching about the things youre going to change and let go of
8016097 make sure youre really clear why you are doing it because there will be days when this is the last thing on the planet you want to do
8016098 the average diet lasts 72 hours but if you have a medical reason it will stick
8016099 you have to have people who share your values who say no i cant afford that
8016100 the beginning is so tough because when youre leaving the working world you may not have that community established
8016101 food is the largest unfixed expense in most household budgets so theres a tremendous amount of money in there
8016102 we tweaked our budget in every way but the majority of extra money came out of groceries
8016103 there is something higher than happiness and that is blessedness
8016104 people have a surprising amount of power even in a sluggish economy
8016105 unemployment is still only around 5 percent and thats very low
8016106 theyll break the budget if you make a compelling enough case and theyre worried about keeping you
8016107 a lot of people will sit back and say im doing such a good job theyll notice and offer more money but theyll assume youre happy if you dont ask for anything
8016108 most people ask for money because they personally need more money they say i just had a baby or we just bought a house or i lost money in stock market or ive been here a long time and work really hard
8016109 dont ask because you feel you deserve or need more make a case that you are
8016110 can you bring in new customers reduce costs improve efficiencies or boost sales then youre open to asking for more money if your company is in crisis mode your job is to make sure your bosses understand how you can be part of solution
8016111 ask when you just did something that made you look like a star
8016112 theres no question that you have a right to your vacation but if you ask after youre gone ten days youve lost some impact
8016113 in a down economy if you want to be promoted when the dust settles be generous with your time
8016114 offer yourself in service to other people get people around you talking about how great you are then you dont have to toot your own horn
8016115 your raise request will be met much more favorably if you and your boss are simpatico
8016116 theyll have a dress code a language maybe they all play golf or have an mba whatever it is thats your path
8016117 people at the top hate looking at lower levels and seeing one of their own theyll pull you up to their level if you look like you belong there
8016118 look for what your boss does in public service and join in whether its doing sustainability and green projects or volunteering at a food bank
8016119 they focus on their work and think if they do a good job and are talented theyll be taken care of but only 50 percent is how talented you are the other 50 percent is being culturally savvy about your company
8016120 they did it to appease the shareholders because they had earned a reputation for being slave drivers
8016121 they continued to reward and promote the people who put in major hours people who didnt have their eyes open who were leaving to go to their kids soccer games got crunched in the process sometimes companies preach ideals they cant live up to its meant for pr not for the employees
8016122 she thought im a vp of course theyll take care of me
8016123 i asked her whats the precedent what have they done for others who went on maternity leave she realized every single one of them had never come back
8016124 high low is a hellish way to run a store its very inefficient
8016125 but a consumer who wants to invest the time and effort can make out like a bandit by buying on the low side
8016126 when i first started i spent a lot more time planning because i had to figure out the coupon thing
8016127 you have to be willing to get the coupons and be careful to stockpile things you use a lot but that dont go bad
8016128 if its buy one get one free or over 50 percent off and you use a coupon thats a good deal
8016129 if you go for rock bottom you may end up with a cart full of air freshener frozen waffles and cat food i dont think thats practical
8016130 the average shopper is doing what the reporter did heres the brand i always get its only 50 cents more but if youre the average family buying a hundred items a week that adds up quickly
8016131 retailers have trained consumers to buy big but people are starting to find that the larger package is more expensive per unit
8016132 we found 48 percent of users are donating food to charity because of the program when they hadnt in the past
8016133 the grocery service went into beta about a year ago and they havent heavily promoted it
8016134 they run great deals if youre an amazon prime member you get and it ships two day you can also shop by sale pages items that are 90 percent off 80 percent off et cetera
8016135 you have to have the production of your income take place there
8016136 i do a lot of work in the entertainment businesses and i dont deduct it because my clients are usually just doing record keeping there theyre not performing or modeling in the home
8016137 you can take this deduction if it helps you maintain your position but not if its to get you a new position
8016138 saving and living within your means is rational only if there is a future payoff that exceeds the value of the present consumption you must sacrifice but government policies tax policies welfare in all its forms bankruptcy laws etc do everything possible to destroy the natural incentives and disincentives
8016139 one person by committing mortgage fraud gets to live in a 500 000 house for 1 000 month realizes 100 000 in appreciation cashes this illusory equity via a home equity line of credit and blows it on toys
8016140 another person takes your advice he foregoes all the consumption the first person enjoyed in terms of both house size and heloc funded toys planning to move up to the bigger house when he can truly afford it but then the government freezes arm adjustments the fed pushes interest rates to the floor and orchestrates a massive bailout of the insolvent mortgage backed securities leading to inflation negative real returns on savings and ultimately higher tax rates when he withdraws from his ira the second person is happier how
8016141 sometimes people do stupid things and take a lot of risk you can take that course and hope you get lucky or rely on prudent principles that have high probability of succeeding
8016142 another guy who gambled on lucent a few years later is still waiting to get his money back
8016143 we have all these anecdotal stories in the media every so often someone gets lucky if you want to be someone who is responsible who has self respect about how you handle yourself financially you have no choice but to save and build capital if not you can wing it and see how it turns out
8016144 if youre working three jobs and trying your best and not getting anywhere its hard to keep the faith
8016145 but whats the alternative do you want to give up do you want to be the person who doesnt need anybody or the one who tries to get taken care of
8016146 building financial assets is tough because it seems to take so long to get anywhere
8016147 but once you get it built it provides financial and intellectual independence thats the ultimate reward the freedom to do what you want on terms you consider reasonable because you have enough assets to tell everyone else to take a hike
8016148 stop comparing yourself to your neighbor and your friend and get down to your core values and execute on them
8016149 the happiest people i meet measure themselves against their own objectives
8016150 try once again outside of politics to serve the common good
8016151 the personality is pretty stable throughout life your interests and values change but your personality holds stable
8016152 understanding what drives you what gets you excited is really key
8016153 theres a fairly heady and theoretical piece to him and at the same time overly aggressive risk taking he would be comfortable anyplace where theres a lot of variety where they appreciate his drive and innovative style but not someplace where he has to play by the rules closely
8016154 there is a strong link between self awareness and job performance
8016155 understand their own tendencies what motivates them what situations and people make them want to get out of bed
8016156 are not honest with themselves they dont realize they are deceiving themselves they point their finger at the boss or coworkers or decisions up top
8016157 look at the people you connect with and figure out what you like about them
8016158 maybe you love to golf with your friend jim or you click with sara at work or your brother in law maybe theyre all extroverts and free thinkers who you like to associate with says a lot about who you are and whats going to motivate you
8016159 people will say im good at planning but i dont like it
8016160 joyful skills are the things that come naturally that you enjoy doing and that others have rewarded you for
8016161 saying i never want to deal with clients again is another piece of data that helps you come up with vision of what you want
8016162 sit down and analyze what you were doing who you were with and why you were so high about what you were doing
8016163 find five or six of these stories and youll start to see a pattern
8016164 finding that bridge taking what you know and spinning in a new direction that will be more satisfying
8016165 view your past life as a tapestry with everything contributing to where youre getting now if you remember that you wont get discouraged in the process
8016166 if youre operating out of fear youll be panicked rather than prepared and take the first thing that comes along youre not going to examine all the information that will tell you if the next job or company is right for you
8016167 the market rewards certain industries more than others and teachers are not rewarded greatly if you need to make x amount think about what industries value people who teach but also reward their skills and endeavor
8016168 were really interested in describing peoples lives as they experience them as opposed to theories about their lives and from that get an overall measure of how people are doing
8016169 were trying to come up with a meaningful way to talk about well being that sounds like the poverty rate or the unemployment rate
8016170 one of the worst activities for all the people we survey is commuting the only thing that ranks below commuting is commuting with your boss
8016171 commuters are not masters of life their schedule is if you can transfer two hours to something more pleasant that can make a big structural difference in how good life is we dont have the causal thing nailed down completely but certainly our research begs for people to make that tradeoff
8016172 people who have more income typically have more responsible jobs
8016173 that extra money comes with additional things that are not as pleasant they cant leave at 5 p m when the whistle blows they might have stress because they have to hire and fire people thats why changing features like income and education dont seem to have as much of an effect on happiness as we think because they have tradeoffs when we think about them we only think about the good things
8016174 some of the least happy people we see in surveys are mothers with young children
8016175 we think its because they are working and stretched too thin
8016176 many decisions are no brainers going to see a movie is more fun than taking out the garbage
8016177 queens is both a destination and a way station where ethnic diversity first undergoes the turbulent process of americanization
8016178 residing than any area in the process of great social and ethnic turmoil
8016179 promised but didnt deliver because ive explored a number of such confused and contrasting areas of this borough and the other four
8016180 that when self focus is high sad individuals experience an implicit devaluation of the self which in turn triggers increased valuation of new commodities
8016181 mirror mirror im at the top of my field im entitled to a higher yield id like to earn that yield today so i get a bonus with my pay tell me now because heres the thing im really entitled to earn more than the king

8016184 i find myself on the executive floor im really entitled to be earning more if the stock went up id have no cares since i own about a million shares ten other banks have opened on my block tell me how to boost my stock
8016185 hand out mortgages across the land and sell them to wall street as fast as you can heed my word in this endeavor and your stock will go up and up forever
8016186 mirror mirror i want to be rich tell me where i can find my niche ive read the secret and im ready for action im familiar with the laws of attraction my ambition is so thoroughly unbridled i think youll agree that im entitled

8016188 i dont have a job or a fancy degree but im smarter than those geniuses on tv and im entitled to a home for free should i call the number that i see
8016189 mirror mirror im exhausted today at work i almost lost it i come home from my toil and fall into bed what can i do to get ahead
8016190 i have no schemes for such an honest dude i sincerely hope you dont get screwed
8016191 another mania another bubble the winners get out before it bursts the man who follows the rules is cursed with a sense of entitlement and plenty of greed you can win this game with lightning speed ive told the tale and now im finished
8016192 house prices in the u s are going to continue to fall through the first part of next year but on the other hand interest rates are likely going to be higher
8016193 if youre looking to buy you need to take that tradeoff into account
8016194 prices have come down but they certainly have more room to fall
8016195 in the washington metro division we expect a peak to trough decline of more than 30 percent prices peaked in the first quarter of 2006 but they have only fallen 15 percent so far so were only halfway there
8016196 it was a neat loft like place with a nifty urban backyard and garage a very chic location across the street from popular bars and restaurants as well as a big park
8016197 i came over to look at it in the middle of a tuesday afternoon and it was reasonably quiet during that time i thought it would be cool to live so close to the hot spot
8016198 the late night crowd meant drunk screamers outside my front door at two a m fender benders and sirens and minor vandalism
8016199 my lesson to the first time homebuyers is to think about your cool location and how it might affect your ability to sleep especially in the summer when the windows are open
8016200 you can save on those things you would have had to repair in a boom market
8016201 there is that opportunity to get the seller to chip in for more of that kind of stuff
8016202 it may be worth the 300 to get a second inspection because any mistake is going to be a lot more than 300
8016203 they put a wool carpet over what was basically a dirt floor so six months later it was all moldy and horrible and disgusting
8016204 if you had the dishwasher on and took a shower you were in a world of hurt it was a trickle
8016205 you could only run one water oriented appliance at a time and even then it was low flow
8016206 i didnt run the dishwasher and the first time i used it water remained inside and leaked into the ceiling of the basement
8016207 i went down to do laundry and part of the ceiling fell down
8016208 only buy the essentials as opposed to what they want
8016209 go back to famous south sea bubble in the late 1700s
8016210 they said this time was different because they had discovered new waterways and expansion for british trade that gave way to massive run up in stock prices in britain and it ended with a spectacular crash also
8016211 financial intermediaries banks and investment companies stretch their balance sheets so as not to be left out
8016212 the upward surge in asset prices continues and that generation of financial market participants concludes that rules have been rewritten risk has been tamed and leverage is always rewarded
8016213 there was liquidity sloshing around not only because of the federal reserve interest rate cuts but because the u s attracted huge capital inflows from abroad
8016214 i have read countless accounts of banking crises in different countries in different time periods and lack of supervision is a common thread
8016215 by 2006 it was pretty evident that there were no standards on the quality of lending part of the problem lies with fact that regulation fell into the hands of individual states it was like having 50 banana republics regulating mortgage credit
8016216 from the 1880s to the outbreak of the first world war the financial center was primarily the united kingdom lending to everywhere china latin america lesser developed parts of europe the u s started to get into the act as a financial power in the 1920s with massive lending from the u s to latin america and other emerging markets
8016217 banking crises are of a very protracted nature you dont get rid of them in a few months
8016218 the absolute worst was japan it took ten years but the norm has been around two years
8016219 if youre there for the buy and hold long term view its a very different world
8016220 these booms and busts do happen but unless you really invested very poorly you do have the ability to ride these things out
8016221 i had that rare feeling watching this movie that im seeing something that i will end up watching many many times in the future to appreciate it more and more
8016222 evil doesnt need a cause it doesnt need a reason evil is a choice
8016223 this is impossible it is haram women are inferior to men they are emotional there religion and there mind is not ideal
8016224 you have to make your position clear you have to come and join us
8016225 i thought we were here to build a secular country not religious one
8016226 habibi we are like a drowned man we will grab the first piece of shit flouting on the water
8016227 i m not a very sophisticated man you know i m a very poor man but i can understand very well that an iraqi goverment will solve lots of issues by the way habibi how come we still have power cuts i thought the day we have a president everything will go back to normal
8016228 its pattern is easily memorized and a breeze to work on in otherwise wasted moments its also ideal for those of us who do not always have a pair of socks on their needles

8016244 if it wasnt for the americans saddam and some other factors we could have liberated iraq long time ago

8016252 mulattoes are less common in proportion than during the times of slavery
8016253 miscegenation is further off thank god than ever neither the blacks nor the whites have any relish for it both have a pride of race which is commendable and which properly directed will lead to the best results for both
8016254 on no other basis under heaven can the negro question be solved
8016255 platform immensely beneficial to both races and injurious to neither
8016256 a degeneration from the race which has never yet feared any other race
8016257 ready to admit that the colored man is our superior in will power courage and intellect
8016258 is a thing each citizen decides for himself no statute ever yet drew the latch of the humblest home or ever will
8016259 on these shores a residence for civil and religious freedom
8016260 to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity
8016261 that every society always prohibits blasphemy that which is forbidden to say is the god of that society
8016262 what interests me about watson is how you can have a guy who supports positions we think of today as being on the political left not because they are perceived to help minorities but because they are thought to help whites
8016263 just see a different slant and having it presented favorably could make a big difference
8016264 i know for a fact that he never got over it it was like he took an oath in w h s name a lot of what hed done up until then in playing ball was to win his fathers respect after the shooting i figure that much of what he did on the diamond was for w h seemed he was out to pay tribute to him in death
8016265 youre still a dixie prick whose folks live off nigger slaves
8016266 h e believed blacks to be fundamentally different from and inferior to whites and thus necessarily suited to a subservient role in a society that must be dominated by whites although most non southern whites probably felt basically the same way that belief was most prevalent among white people in the southern states
8016267 he had pleasant recollections of a black maid who had looked after the cobb children at their home in royston and he was capable of acts of kindness toward particular black persons
8016268 but cobb had no patience whatever with blacks who were insolent fractious unsubmissive in a word uppity
8016269 when a spectator calls me a half nigger i think it is about time to fight
8016270 most working sportswriters tended to side with cobb agreeing that spectators abuse of players had got out of hand and that the slur hurled at him would have provoked almost any white man especially a sensitive southerner
8016271 georgias entire congressional delegation two senators and ten representatives wired cobb that as georgians we commend your action in resisting an uncalled for insult mayor courtland s winn of atlanta praised him for upholding the principles that have always been taught to southern manhood and the citys police commissioner thought that if cobb hadnt licked that man as he should he would have lost the respect of every decent man in the country
8016272 the greatness of ty cobb was something that had to be seen and to see him was to remember him forever
8016273 the boys and girls out of the fields and mountains
8016274 most working sportswriters tended to side with cobb agreeing that spectators abuse of players had got out of hand and that the slur hurled at him would have provoked almost any white man especially a sensitive southerner
8016275 violence doesnt solve anything i prefer to turn the other cheek
8016276 this has been a natural progression for us and we are confident that our knowledge of the region has offered our firm an invaluable opportunity for growth
8016277 the nation suddenly found itself in the grip of social revolution the civil rights movement peace movement womens movement and sexual revolution quickly changed america from a stable traditional society into a political and cultural war zone the media and the academy quickly sided with the revolutionaries and began to exert an ever increasing influence on christian churches soon it became unfashionable to adhere to creeds and traditional ways
8016278 the course of protestant civilization extending from the search for individual salvation to expressive individualism human rights crusades and wars against discrimination points up a constant pattern a line though not entirely a straight one leads from the older religious outlook stressing a pure heart and a transformed consciousness to the politics of sensitivity
8016279 individual sensitivity social guilt and the personal overcoming of ones depraved ancestral society are the common attributes of modern managerial subjects
8016280 allowed to feel righteous individually while being part of a historically wicked society and as a country redeemed from its own racist sexist homophobic past the repentant protestant is allowed to go forth and bring enlightenment to others thus the humbled self debasing sinner achieves ultimate purpose as a crusader on a never ending global mission
8016281 the complementarity of the secular and ecclesiastical swords has been restored
8016282 in the sense that the dominant religious culture gives aid and direction to state purposes
8016283 sexism must by seen as the original and primary model for analyzing the state of the fall
8016284 indulge in the lust of defiling passion and despise authority
8016285 after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the lord and savior jesus christ they are again entangled in them and overcome the latter end is worse for them than the beginning for it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than having known it to turn from the holy commandment delivered to them
8016286 to devastating dismantlings of their drivel with yet more drivel
8016287 a religion that stresses human depravity and the need for divine grace for even a minimally good human act should not be seen as leading into sentimental or moral self indulgence
8016288 feminism is going to make it possible for the first time for men to be free
8016289 devolution of a feminist inspired partnership into a tense marriage between an aggrieved woman her ambitions thwarted by family life and a freewheeling man uncomprehending of his wifes complaints
8016290 but in the long run the conflation of love and work created its own problems autonomy and a conviction of her professional worth forever eluded bryant in the late 1920s her career destroyed through the combined effects of alcohol illness and devastating divorce from a third husband she would in fact try desperately to resurrect her role in the old reed bryant partnership by re creating herself as professional widow and keeper of his flame
8016291 considered herself part of the army of women all over the country who were out to hurt their mother sic who had to in order to work more and more and more of us are coming all the time and more of us will come until the sum of us will change the customs of the world she rejoiced
8016292 the psychology of disaffiliation spread through feminism so much so that the disavowal of the mother came to be almost a trademark of female modernism
8016293 john deweys influence is evident in randolph bournes belief that democracy could not be separated from the individuals quest for self realization
8016294 the departure of the moderns lay in their belief that working class sexuality was a distinct alternative that could inspire and invigorate the culture
8016295 blessed are they that hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be filled
8016296 do these things and you will prosper fail to do them and you will be destroyed
8016297 t he same age and a similar stature is required well matched and vigorous they wed and the offspring reproduce the strength of the parents
8016298 if anyone does not provide for his relatives and especially for his immediate family he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever
8016299 at the very least what is obvious is that many of our problems stem from the proximity of races to each other who for eons of prehistory never had anything to do with each other and have no way of interacting without a great deal of natural enmity
8016300 on december 19 2003 rob leverett 91 married sheetal rajah at the bible bhaven christian fellowship new delhi india
8016301 we are all human beings immigrants are an integral part of our community and they are not going to go away we are recognising the reality that we cannot go after these people and survive as a city
8016302 you may not mix with these nations remaining among you or make mention of the names of their gods or swear by them or serve them or bow down to them for if you turn back and cling to the remnant of these nations remaining among you and make marriages with them so that you associate with them and they with you know for certain that the lord your god will no longer drive out these nations before you but they shall be a snare and a trap for you a whip on your sides and thorns in your eyes until you perish from off this good ground that the lord your god has given you
8016303 and he made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth having determined allotted periods and the boundaries of their dwelling place that they should seek god in the hope that they might feel their way toward him and find him
8016304 for the race everything for those outside the race nothing
8016305 to the extent that white people are doing this we are contemptible
8016306 the universal answer was master we want to stay right here with you in many instances the slaves were so infatuated with the idea of being as they said free as birds that they left their homes and consequently suffered but our slaves were not so foolish
8016307 considered no man free who had to work for a living
8016308 they will not work for anything but wages they expect to see all the land divided out equally between them and their old masters in time to make the next crop t he impression widely prevails that congress is about to divide out the lands and that this impression is given out by federal soldiers at the nearest military station it cannot be disguised that in spite of the most earnest efforts of their old master to conciliate and satisfy them the estrangement between races increases in its extent and bitterness nearly all the negro men are armed with repeaters and many of them carry them openly day and night
8016309 they the confederates framed iniquity and universal murder into law their pirates burned your unarmed commerce upon every sea they carved the bones of the dead heroes into ornaments and drank from goblets made out of their skulls they poisoned your fountains put mines under your soldiers prisons organized bands whose leaders were concealed in your homes and commissions ordered the torch and yellow fever to be carried to your cities and to your women and children they planned one universal bonfire of the north from lake ontario to the missouri
8016310 our citizens who had been accustomed to meet and treat the negroes only as respectful servants were mortified pained and shocked to encounter them wearing federal uniforms and bearing bright muskets and gleaming bayonets they are jostled from the sidewalks by dusky guards marching four abreast they were halted in rude and sullen tones by negro sentinels
8016311 we may regard the entire ten unreconstructed southern states with possibly one or two exceptions as forced by a secret and overwhelming revolutionary influence to a common and inevitable fate they are all bound to be governed by blacks spurred on by worse than blacks white wretches who dare not show their faces in respectable society anywhere this is the most abominable phase barbarism has assumed since the dawn of civilization it is not right to make slaves of white men this is but a change in a system of bondage that is rendered the more odious and intolerable because it has been inaugurated in an enlightened instead of a dark and uncivilized age
8016312 i caused quite a controversy in 65 or 66 when i said that integration was a loser a pious fraud neither black nor white people really wanted it what the black people want are the same rights as the whites
8016313 long after you and i are planted race will still be the number one issue
8016314 for example when describing the beating of rodney king by officers from the lapd kevin starr leaves out critical information
8016315 then too starr does not mention that by lapd policy officers were no longer allowed to grapple with a resisting suspect or apply a chokehold to render the suspect unconscious
8016316 my parents had conflicting views about the nature and origin of good manners my father took the romantic view that they were the expression of mans natural goodness of heart and that they therefore emerged spontaneously that is if they emerged at all if they didnt it was because of the social injustice that inhibited or destroyed the natural goodness my mother took the classical view that good manners were a matter of discipline training and habit and that goodness of heart would at least to an extent follow in their wake the older i grow the more decisively i take my mothers side
8016317 the concept was revolutionary in practice because as soon as you say there are no basic principles at all that everything is debatable and uncertain changeable from day to day you automatically wipe the slate clean you throw historical experience and background to the wind and you begin all over again which is precisely what the marxians want someone to do therefore john dewey was a gift from the gods to the radicals
8016318 views reflected the theory of organic evolution and a faith in mans capacity to achieve moral progress and a more nearly ideal social environment especially through improvements in education
8016319 practical experimental action to change the external environment and thus more successfully to fulfill human needs
8016320 truth is useful public and objective truth benefits society not merely the individual
8016321 fulfillment of human needs and desires the continuous growth of human beings in moral sensitivity
8016322 human progress in the practical realization of a better social world
8016323 absolute goods or evils do not exist each situation is specific and calls for specific methods of inquiry the greatest good is the elimination of the greatest evil or the fulfillment of mans greatest need
8016324 judgments about values are judgments about the conditions and results of experienced objects
8016325 the unity of all ideal ends arousing us to desire and actions
8016326 the word god means the ideal ends that at a given time and place are acknowledged as having authority over his volition and emotion the values to which one is supremely devoted as far as these ends through imagination take on unity
8016327 rest content with absolute commitment faith which helps us face the future resolutely reconstructing our environment in order to attain satisfactory adjustments
8016328 practical faith in ideal ends a common faith free from the limitation of sect class or race a faith that all mankind may embrace consisting of a heritage of values which we most prize in civilization
8016329 organize the school as a miniature community with first hand experiences that would enable pupils to do practical things cooperatively and thereby learn the attitudes and skills of good citizenship
8016330 awaken an interest in socialism among the educated men and women of the country
8016331 the observation of vocational resources of the community social studies in the high school shall include community health housing homes human rights versus property rights impulsive actions of mobs the selfish conservatism of traditions and public utilities
8016332 here you have the inception of the move to use the schools for a political objective to modify the social order and therefore to become instruments of propaganda
8016333 tax exempt foundations are directly involved because they have supported this movement in the past and are still promoting it in ways that restrict educational activities and control public opinion
8016334 on church estates the jew became the collector of all ecclesiastical dues standing by the church door for his payment from tithe payers baptized infants newly weds and mourners
8016335 jews became an entrenched part of an exploitative and oppressive elite in which group boundaries were blurred
8016336 directorates were headed by ethnic jews including those in charge of state security police labor camps and resettlement i e deportation
8016337 blockade killed a good many more civilians than did submarine warfare
8016338 it had to follow the immanent laws of revolution as laid down by marx and also the directions as laid down by moscow
8016339 most potent spiritual characteristics of the people they lived among
8016340 told audiences that generals statesmen diplomats and editors were talking about the duty of simply exterminating the german people
8016341 too many people here and in england hold to the view that the german people as a whole are not responsible for what has taken place that only a few nazi leaders are responsible that unfortunately is not based on fact the german people must have it driven home to them that the whole nation has been engaged in a lawless conspiracy against the decencies of modern civilization
8016342 you either have to castrate or you have to treat them so they cant just go on reproducing people who want to continue the way they have in the past fleming p 428
8016343 we are convinced that education is the one unfailing remedy for every ill to which man is subject whether it be vice crime war poverty riches injustice racketeering political corruption race hatred class conflict or just plain ordinary sin
8016344 how can we fight racism and fascism abroad and tolerate it here emerged as staples of postwar rhetoric and became the basis for the dismantling of traditional american social relations in 1947 the report of the presidents commission on higher education launched a frontal assault
8016345 the efforts of individual institutions local communities the several states the educational foundations and associations the federal government will be more effective if they are directed toward the same general ends
8016346 the nations of the globe are already one world the task is to secure recognition and acceptance of this oneness in the thinking of the people so that the concept of one world may be realized psychologically socially and in good time politically
8016347 there is urgent need for a program for world citizenship that can be made a part of every persons general education
8016348 it will take social science and social engineering to solve the problems of human relations
8016349 colleges must accelerate the normal slow rate of social change which the educational system reflects we need to find ways quickly of making the understanding and vision of our most farsighted and sensitive citizens the common possession of all our people
8016350 educational programs everywhere should be aimed at undermining and eventually eliminating the attitudes that are responsible for discrimination and segregation
8016351 contradictions between popular conceptions and the realities of the 20th century
8016352 it is therefore imperative that they our youth be equipped to understand the nature and complexity of problems that surround them and that they be trained in the art of judgment that will be ultimately reflected in the public decisions that constitute the foundation of official governmental policies
8016353 a peaceful world order operating through international organizations the immediate purpose of such education in the elementary and secondary schools of the united states is the development of american citizens who are conscious of their new obligations to mankind
8016354 the social causes of war are overwhelmingly more important than the attitudes and behavior of individuals if this be true the primary approach to the prevention of war must involve action in the area of social and political organization and control
8016355 use these media in promoting the ideal peace and in convincing others of the validity of the objective
8016356 s ince the society of nations is only three centuries old the system is not necessarily permanent but may be only a stage in the evolution of political groups
8016357 passing an inadequate and bigoted bill for this purpose which law imposes no american restrictions based on race and religion upon such admissions
8016358 our own economy requires expanded export markets for our manufactured and agricultural products and a greater supply of essential imported raw materials
8016359 as of today the schock campaign has officially committed to exactly zero debates
8016360 the callahan campaign either is confused or is trying to mislead voters in order to get some attention in the media
8016361 the real problem for the callahan campaign is that they need aaron schock to draw a crowd for them and get publicity the ten candidate forums debates we have agreed to are more than three times what the presidential candidates have agreed to
8016362 the callahan campaign has failed to excite voters because the sum total of the callahan campaign to date has been non stop shrill and baseless attacks on aaron schock
8016363 that turns people off and is the furthest thing from change
8016364 todays press release from callahans campaign was downright false contradicted by her own web site and a typical publicity stunt to get media coverage for a failing campaign
8016365 i believe the best forum for voters to see the candidates in their work clothes is in a debate
8016366 the debate format presents the opportunity for the candidates to not only
8016367 schock has withdrawn from several previously scheduled debates often giving no reason for his withdrawal
8016368 during the course of the thirteenth century the hebrew sources begin to express discomfort with womens adoption of such practices and the objections became more prevalent the objections to women performing a variety of ritual activities baalot brit tefillin and zizit as well as the question of the kind of blessing they were allowed to make when performing the rituals were all widely discussed during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries
8016369 following a period of relative religious freedom for women as is evident in the growth of lay piety and female orders in the twelfth century church authorities of the thirteenth entury were determined to curb womens opportunities and especially their religious functions thus for example women who tried to preach were gravely reproached many of their religious practices including fasting andother devotions were criticized
8016370 its like yoda said you must unlearn what youve learned
8016371 such a quiet thing it is to fall far more terrible is to admit it
8016372 im going over here to try to make myself a better racecar driver
8016373 i wanted to be more competitive and i wanted to have some more opportunities to win races and things like that
8016374 it seems like this year it has been the worst year out of the three so i guess you could say that probably factored in on things like that
8016375 i felt like ive done everything i can with the situation im in now
8016376 like i said it just seems like this last year it got a little bit worse as far as not being able to find some speed at some of these places
8016377 it seems like they are definitely on an uphill climb towards the top
8016378 they have definitely made progress its a team that i think will be here for a long time and seems to be heading in the right direction to win races
8016379 reed is a highly talented driver with a wealth of experience and accomplishments for a 22 year old
8016380 we believe he has a great future ahead of him here at gillett evernham motorsports he will be a great fit with our drivers sponsors and employees
8016381 i think they believe in me as a driver and that means a lot and i believe in them as a team
8016382 you know any type of breakup like that is not the easiest thing in the world to do for either side
8016383 but i feel like it went fairly well im not too sure how good those types of things can go but i think its ok
8016384 i think everybody kind of tried to pull together and tried to make sure that nobody was pointing fingers or anything like that
8016385 it is the great writers the novelists who see deeper and further than us and the reson is that they unlike us focus not on events but on people and i who have spent my entire life examining the minute details of events did i hear the anguished cry of noras soul
8016386 im going to have him in the lineup pretty much everyday
8016387 for the sake of the kids knock on wood we can keep that going and keep these guys able to play camp was very physical and very aggressive and the guys were able to handle it we were in great shape to handle the workload and its showed up and paid off for us so hopefully well continue

8016393 i cant remember going into the opener with the team pretty much intact luck helped
8016394 its a big time football game we expect its going to be a very difficult game were holding nothing back were not resting anybody and were not going to get somebody ready for a couple weeks from now were going for it and thats the only way we know how to do it
8016395 we have a lot of similarities they are a a pretty classic as i would see it classic run and play action team its an nfl offense is what it is and an nfl 3 4 defense that al groh brought from his years in the league
8016396 coach grohs team looks a lot like the patriots the jets teams he was a part of
8016397 i still dont know how its going to feel swinging
8016398 im being a little tentative to do so im going to give it a couple more days its definitely taken some good steps forward in the past week a lot less pain in the last week
8016399 justin why did wotc remove the usage numbers from the server status update
8016400 i just applied one of the basic concepts of math if its too hard to calculate dont
8016401 ask 10 players to define what casual is and you will get 15 different answers
8016402 we brits tend not to mince words when discussing the posterior
8016403 childlike enthusiasm isnt tolerated only jaded cynicism combined with optimistic addiction is allowed
8016404 why i remember when my avatar was only 2d and you actually had to log out to buy product and to get to the online store it was uphill both ways in the snow
8016405 if you dont have anything nice to say keep editing your post
8016406 punctuation is like alchohol some can use it in moderation some cant you may need to visit pa for help
8016407 no wonder i took up piracy life is just so much simpler looting and plundering
8016408 i do think that no matter what wizards does there will still be complaints
8016409 unless your idea of fun is magic the f4 button

8016411 hey everyone i know this isnt going to be on the top of anyones to do list but there seems to be a problem with the new avatars the figure of destiny and the ashling the extinguisher ones theres 2 blank spots when i try to go to put them on and this isnt a technical issue so dont move it im just wondering when this is going to get fixed i understand that the morinfen and peacekeeper avatars dont work either but this doesnt really make sense to me my guess would be that they arent there because they havent had the 3d art made for them but lets be honest nobody likes that anyway and it doesnt work so why not just add that little square of a picture so that people can actually use the avatars that they won
8016412 were getting ready to play one so thats not a fair question
8016413 throughout the country i think its been obvious to everybody in a lot of situations sometimes youre left without a game because somebody pulls out or changes the contract on you and things need to be adjusted and theres not a lot of people always willing to go play you
8016414 in the end you do the best you can to get a strong schedule or one that the fans are going to enjoy you do the best you can and i think over the years ours has been pretty good
8016415 this is not a thing that is strictly handed down from parents to children

8016417 ive already been on tour 10 years and i want to enjoy my tennis
8016418 i dont want to fight anybody i dont want to face any problems on the court its not like im starving to death and i need to do something original to earn money i want to enjoy its so simple
8016419 i just want to have a nice match win or lose and whatever happens go home thats it i dont want to face the foot faults and all these things
8016420 i would behave like a baby and crying and all this he hated it
8016421 he was always come on you have to grow up in your mind you cannot behave like this thats why hes like learn from my experience dont do this
8016422 i think if she will do everything opposite of what ive been doing throughout the years she will be number one in the world for a long time
8016423 two tough finals and i think the third one is here she should take her chance i think she is ready to win the first grand slam im really proud of the way shes handling the pressure and the way shes handling herself
8016424 i just dont play well here i just dont play aggressive enough just in general i either just dont rise to the occasion or maybe the pressure gets to me
8016425 today i was more offensive than i usually am so i think thats why i displayed some positive play i dont know im not in the final 8 club i have to try mixed doubles or something
8016426 yeah i think i can have the whole next year free
8016427 im a very big competitor so obviously i want myself to win
8016428 at the moment thats a lot to ask for i just want to take it match by match i have good potential to slowly get into a tournament and play fresh
8016429 its been nice to know that other coaches and media outlets have expectations for you and have respect for your program
8016430 we know those preseason rankings can do a lot more harm than good we make sure not to focus on that stuff and go about our business like we always do
8016431 weve ridden this underdog thing pretty well for a while now and its been kind of fun to be under the radar
8016432 im sure the young guys are loving every second of it but it makes the old guys nervous because they know it makes other teams play harder you get everybodys best shot and get their best effort every week
8016433 sometimes we feel like were taking a shot in the dark trying to guess what theyre going to do what weve really been focusing on is ourselves we need to make sure we have the answers for whatever they bring against us
8016434 hes really got a good sense of when somebody is getting the big head
8016435 and he knows how to put a stop to that kind of stuff whether its running extra gassers or having longer practices
8016436 if we get a chance to help make an impact on a kids life thats why were here
8016437 i kept hitting good shots and then i chipped one in thats the way golf goes i kept telling my caddie man weve played pretty good today weve been pretty much in every hole with a chance to do something special and somebody tops me i top somebody then coming down the stretch i hit some good shots and got a couple of good breaks
8016438 i had to compose myself guys dont have to do that its just a reflection on who he singh is as a person he understands and respects what were trying to get done
8016439 hes never played a fundraising event this was going to be his first one ever
8016440 i think that speaks to the amount of respect he has for our friendship
8016441 some of the expenses claimed by defendant clearly should have been deleted by the court
8016442 mr strahan is gratified with the result and feels his legal position has been vindicated
8016443 he hopes the matter can be resolved amicably going forward in the interests of his children
8016444 when they bury me are they going to put on my gravestone youre one win ahead of bobby bowden
8016445 its attainable if i stay healthy and whole and win like i should
8016446 its working out you dont have to be a genius to figure out that clark was the guy who should be the guy who developed to be number one
8016447 we have a fluid situation we have a nice situation
8016448 i still dont want to go into the season where you have a two quarterback or three quarterback system
8016449 i think clark ought to go in there and have a little fun playing
8016450 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8016451 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8016452 its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize
8016453 we knew it was a long shot but we owed it to ourselves to exhaust the possibility
8016454 we appreciate michael even considering ending his retirement he has a new career in front of him and we wish him nothing but the best as we all said when he announced his retirement michael was and is a great giant
8016455 there is a reason he went in the first round obviously
8016456 the guy he is playing behind strahan and osi and then we moved him to linebacker so obviously he is one of our top players on the team and he is going to show that he is a top defensive end in the league
8016457 we know we are a confident team and we are a playoff capable team and we have to go out and perform like it
8016458 the reason we took the underdog role last year was because everybody said it and we just went with it were not thinking like that this year we do have a chip on our shoulders and it grows more and more when somebody gives us something to feed off of
8016459 the only reason he will come back is if he wants to play
8016460 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
8016461 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
8016462 i think it motivates the guys to prepare well but the big thing is if you think about a championship way back in january that can wear you down
8016463 its our responsibility as coaches to help these guys break it down to one day at a time one workout at a time one practice at a time just prepare to be in position for the challenge
8016464 they dont have any game film on our team i can assure you of that
8016465 i dont like talking about it but theres going to be things that i plan to do that ive never done on a college level
8016466 yall will see its going to be a whole other season
8016467 glen coffee is mr consistency for us in terms of being able to do just about everything whether its being a good receiver being a good blocker and being decent when he has the ball in his hands
8016468 mark ingram has probably been the surprise of all the young players in terms of his maturity as a player
8016469 hes elusive he has speed but he has power and tremendous toughness and hes a good receiver hes a very very good all around guy
8016470 we dont have a third down back in that bunch
8016471 we feel like several of those guys can play that role and we certainly need to figure out ways to use that group
8016472 third and 2 is just as important as a 50 yard gain when it comes down to it
8016473 but i will be tuning in after the game and i will find out what they rushed for so i cant lie about that
8016474 i didnt think we were going to lose the game but we didnt put it away and that was what we needed to do
8016475 it seemed like that was the personality of that team for five weeks so were trying to make sure that this bunch is consistently good and they do finish
8016476 our team motto will be consistently good to be great because we felt like weve got to play better each week
8016477 weve had a lot of great games but when we havent played well for whatever reason weve got to figure that out weve got enough depth and weve got to have great energy and passion every time that we go out there
8016478 weve kind of been talking about it for a long time since the bowl game until now
8016479 i feel like we have been consistently good we have won 10 games the last two years twenty games in two years is pretty consistent and our focus now is to be great we want to do better than that we want to be the best we can it starts on saturday with florida atlantic
8016480 coach muschamp calls us a blue collared defense and we work hard
8016481 we say that no matter what if you mess up at least mess up going 100 miles an hour
8016482 we have talked about playing a team on even par with whoever it might be texas michigan state minnesota nebraska south carolina florida
8016483 we think we have enough experience now and enough talent to go out and play man to man jaw to jaw tooth to tooth and have a hell of a contest and win our share
8016484 its stupid rules that somebody made in i dont know 1850
8016485 now they give me the problems with these things and it shouldnt be that way
8016486 how can the guy see with sunglasses from 35 metres away on a foot fault it doesnt make any sense
8016487 its not so complicated the chair umpire when they go with the linesman first when i start to make the foot fault they should tell me listen youre making a foot fault be careful next time im calling it
8016488 and if youre making it on the centre line what difference does it make doesnt help me to serve better
8016489 i think the people in tennis are missing some rules
8016490 its really really disappointing in the fourth set because after a foot fault on the second serve youre facing set point
8016491 i think i have the point here and the people should do something about it if you ask anybody in the locker room they will tell you the same thing its wrong the officials they should change something because they dont understand it
8016492 ive been already on tour for 10 years and i want to enjoy my tennis i dont want to fight anybody i dont want any problems on the court i just want to enjoy it
8016493 its not like im playing because im starving to death and i need to do something original to earn money
8016494 everybody says well some teams run this not like we run it
8016495 its no huddle fast paced fast tempo involve your quarterback in running the football spread the field use a lot of wide receivers
8016496 it hasnt been that both have done bad or both have done great
8016497 its just that both have been very consistent the players rally around both of them
8016498 its a great situation for us both will be hungry to play and i want it that way i want them both to be very competitive but i also want both of them to know theyre on the same team
8016499 the thing about kodi is hes still in the learning mode
8016500 chris has been in this offense since diapers hes been running it forever without a big separation i think its great on kodis part to be able to catch up and learn chris has been a big part of that chris has been helping him out
8016501 this seems like the year theres just something in the air that makes this year feel special
8016502 we really have a chance to have a pretty good football team
8016503 we have 16 returning starters and each is vital toward our success in the fall we have worked diligently this offseason to get better and are very excited to start the season
8016504 kinsmon is carrying over from where he left off last fall
8016505 he is doing a great job leading the team and hes executing very well right now
8016506 this should be a priority in their professional development just the way working on their short game is a priority
8016507 what we would do is work with them on where they fell short provide them the resources they need the tutoring and when we feel like they need to be evaluated again we would evaluate
8016508 we play so good overall when you win you should give your speech in english
8016509 mostly what comes out is nerves totally different language in front of camera youre excited and not thinking in english
8016510 this is the game and i think its important to keep perspective
8016511 and if this is the toughest thing i have to face in life i think ill have a very easy life theres bound to be more peaks and valleys along the way and but i think this has helped prepare me for those peaks and valleys that ill face further in life
8016512 my goal in all this was never to get the approval of everybody
8016513 i think its very easy for a lot of people to sit back and say i would have done this or i would have done that i think if you went and asked people a bunch of my peers if theyd do the same thing i think a lot of them would say yes
8016514 the medal will collect dust just like any other piece of hardware
8016515 its about the journey that youve gone on for me the medal was nice and like i said it was unbelievable just to be on that podium but its been about the journey to get there
8016516 i love my country i love what we stand for i dont know how many times i have to say that people keep asking me that i mean ill live the rest of my life here and the fortunate thing for me is that i know where i came from and i know where im going which is i think when you know that and you understand that you can pretty much take on anything
8016517 i dont think anybody would have cared if i was the 12th player on the bench
8016518 i think a lot of people thought i deserved to be on usa basketball
8016519 our coaches go and coach over in other countries for the olympics athletes go over to other countries other athletes from other countries come here and win medals for the united states
8016520 so i just dont think people were aware of that so what better way to tell them than this little girl from south dakota
8016521 the juices are flowing just because the first game is coming
8016522 yeah i thought we had a really good preseason were excited about our execution
8016523 we came out and we got into training camp at the beginning it was the best the offense has started for us at camp
8016524 usually the defense is far and away ahead but having the guys that we had at certain positions we were able to kind of pick up where we left off and go from there and it was important to get that feeling of confidence
8016525 actually this might be the easiest week for a lot of guys
8016526 this is obviously an opportunity for all of us especially for the starters and the guys who are going to go into the season full steam ahead to kind of get our legs back get refreshed and then be ready to go next week
8016527 last year we came out of the gate pretty good in that first game
8016528 were a pretty veteran group experienced especially offensive i think well be ok
8016529 we want this to be true to the game of baseball
8016530 we dont want our bat to suddenly change the parameters of the game we want to fit comfortably in those parameters and i think we will
8016531 i accepted i was not major league caliber at that point
8016532 the result is that it is very strong and as a result of it being strong it is very safe
8016533 it is impossible for this maple bat to shatter in the way the maple bats shatter in the major leagues today you will never have a barrel separating from the handle the worst thing that can happen is a crack there is a never a catastrophic break
8016534 the difference between a catastrophic injury and a bruise is a just little movement
8016535 i liked the handle usually bats like that break easy this felt pretty durable
8016536 all the normal things that happen with bats will happen with this bat
8016537 if you hit a ball on the sweet spot of this bat and the sweet spot of a traditional bat the ball will go equally far
8016538 i cant put a price on the safety of the children
8016539 i dont know the particulars of what it costs if it works well find a way to make it work in montclair
8016540 it sounds like it is supposed to any wood bat is better to me than the ping of the aluminum bat
8016541 you watch the college world series and hear that ping and to me it is not baseball
8016542 sorry but this thread seems just like spam tt is for off topic discussion not no topic discussion
8016543 stop that if youre not careful rational thinking may catch on
8016544 you know a thread is gonna be locked when it gets to the hexadecimal stage
8016545 justin why did wotc remove the usage numbers from the server status update
8016546 i just applied one of the basic concepts of math if its too hard to calculate dont

8016553 no wonder i took up piracy life is just so much simpler looting and plundering
8016554 i do think that no matter what wizards does there will still be complaints

8016556 how evil can that be cant look cant touch what is that like the diet coke of evil
8016557 lord please help me to find a place for this today
8016558 lord i know this is silly but i really need to find them
8016559 im not as crazy as what my kids think i am
8016560 wow thats some dry erase board you have there maybe that is what i need to get organized
8016561 yeah about a year ago the company paid for a computer program for everyone to use to get organized but it isnt working at all so we are back to the dry erase board
8016562 if i die drag my body across the boarder so i can be dead in colorado
8016563 will you just relax i have allowed you to be sick for a reason so accept it the way you accept anything else that i bring into your life
8016564 i am tired so let me eat to refuel myself
8016565 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
8016566 ive been calling for more troops for over two years along with john mccain and others subsequent to my saying that
8016567 well the point is it turned out they didnt but everyone in the world thought he had them the weapons inspectors said he had them he catalogued they catalogued them this was not some some cheney you know pipe dream this was in fact catalogued
8016568 the more people learn about them obama and hillary and how they handle the pressure the more their support will evaporate
8016569 if iowans believe campaign funds and celebrity will fix the debacle in iraq put the economy on track and provide health care and education for americas children they should support another candidate but im confident that iowans know what i know our problems will require experience and leadership from day one empty slogans will be no match for proven action on caucus night
8016570 when this campaign is over political slogans like change will mean absolutely nothing the next president has to act
8016571 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off
8016572 i am not running for vice president and if i were offered the position i would refuse it
8016573 barak obama is not ready to lead because the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
8016574 the only guy on the other side whos qualified is john mccain
8016575 no one knows better than i do after the last 18 months that barack has met his challenges with judgement and wisdom and steel in his spine i have watched as he has inspired millions of americans to this new cause
8016576 im a firm believer in knowing what you are doing before applying for a job if i were to run nationally id have to begin right now before serving even a single day in the senate some people might be comfortable with that i am not one of those people
8016577 eat as much ice cream as you can and then sleep for 3 hours instinct
8016578 its not the size of the dog in the fight its the size of the fight in the dog
8016579 u s small companies are a contrarian place to be right now
8016580 most people are still stuck on that large company bandwagon but quietly small companies are outperforming
8016581 we liked the strategy but we didnt think the timing was right in terms of where they were in the cycle
8016582 i dont like to tell a patient when they first walk in that they need surgery
8016583 well at least it happened during the week that you werent planning to write
8016584 it might be good for you to get some fresh air
8016585 publishing in the mainstream media is annoying for example half my editors worsen my submissions
8016586 in the mainstream media i rarely get to write about what i most want to write about a truly honest examination of race in the workplace that schools and colleges are unfair to boys and men that reverse discrimination is a net negative to society and that education especially higher education is americas most overrated product and desperately needs reinvention
8016587 i might not agree with all your contentions but i sure respect your bravery and integrity in forwarding them
8016588 lo hace en un tema en el cual su trayectoria es muy pobre
8016589 a la oposici n no la dejan entrar a palacio y s lo hacen los paramilitares
8016590 look it is not my fault he cheated on his wife and i have done nothing wrong by discovering his unfaithfulness you could know it too if youd look at the evidence but you wont consider it i am not the bad guy here and you guys are being unreasonable im being ostracized when he should be the one that is ostracized i am not going to substitute your judgment for mine when i aware of more facts than you are you cant fairly judge whether i am telling the truth or not until you at least examine the evidence i am more than happy to share with you but i wont force upon you
8016591 que confirmen con el aeropuerto ante la posibilidad de que su vuelo haya sido afectado
8016592 unless i look feeble really old obviously pregnant or in my dying throes i can manage to stand along with other fully abled men and women
8016593 its really satisfying to create a big arena rock feel by playing each part myself this approach allows me to lock in to some subtle nuances of each instrument and realize the vision i have for each song
8016594 growing up i formed a lifelong love of progressive rock most notably rush and yes
8016595 when i heard some of the electronic music of the 90s i always thought that a combination of prog rock with electronica would be something exciting so this record has both prog rock songs and electronic drum loop based songs with heavier fuzzier guitar textures theres also a strong acoustic undercurrent to the album which represents my time as a busker in boston
8016596 it was really exciting to know that eddie appreciated what i was putting out there its cool to think our demo tape got some air time in the pearl jam tour bus
8016597 bueno en este momento la operaci n est en stand bay por el tema del d lar
8016598 si el ejecutivo y el legislativo quieren que prevariquemos que presenten el proyecto de ley o reforma a la constituci n
8016599 yo estaba esperando a que oscar c rdoba se adaptara a todo lo que es millonarios el ven a de una peque a para entonces se fue preparando y cuando yo consider necesario lo puse en el arco porque yo no puedo esperar a que jos cuadrado haga un mal partido para cambiarlo
8016600 a c rdoba lo trajimos ac por todo lo que significa por su historia en el f tbol por lo que es y tiene que ser el n mero uno debe tener la responsabilidad y yo pienso que est preparado para hacerlo ya trabaj ya se adapt y est listo aunque jos cuadrado se gan un espacio una gran confianza e igual debemos confiar en lo que hace
8016601 me parece espantoso lo que sucedi nunca me meto con los rbitros pero esta vez le dije que me iba a quejar ellos pueden cometer errores pero cuando existe la posibilidad reglamentaria de apoyarte en tus asistentes y tienes la oportunidad de corregir un error debes hacerlo de lo contrario se te empieza a ocurrir que es adrede lo que hizo
8016602 el l nea abraham gonz lez le dijo que la falta que ni siquiera existi hab a sido afuera pero no le import y eso me molest
8016603 pienso que es una etapa de transici n dentro del torneo ojal siempre pudi ramos estar arriba nosotros sabemos que trabajamos en una profesi n que est llena de presiones y que estamos en un equipo como millonarios con una historia excelente por eso pretendemos trabajar para ser campeones entonces no nos puede presionar el hecho de perder el primer lugar
8016604 el ma o es una persona que aprecio lo conozco desde hace mucho tiempo incluso hace muy poco hablamos por tel fono para preguntarle por un jugador manuel maciel al que l hab a tenido en la selecci n paraguaya durante el mundial del 2006

8016613 la unidad del partido es para ella muy importante la he o do hablar dos veces y cada vez habla con su coraz n de la necesidad de apoyar a obama biden
8016614 auch die lokale politik in d rpen steht in der verantwortung ihren beitrag f r eine zukunftsf hige energieversorgung in deutschland zu leisten der ausbau der kohleverstromung ist eine klimapolitische und wirtschaftliche sackgasse mit dem neu und ausbau von kohlekraftwerken ist eine sichere energieversorgung in deutschland nicht zu gew hrleisten der kohle exportstrom f r die schweiz wird zumindest nicht die vermeintliche deutsche stroml cke schlie en

8016617 its pretty humiliating for him to not be able to find his way home and not have any access to any communication to tell us
8016618 if our solution can stop this from happening once thats what the core of this company is all about
8016619 it takes any confusion away from being able to access mobile technology
8016620 if you can walk talk and pick up a phone you can pretty much call anyone with our phone
8016621 the concept has far broader implications and possible market when we consider the aging population and kids
8016622 weve progressed the idea pretty solidly and now weve got a pretty strong business plan
8016623 weve had quite a bit of interest from small private investors who feel pretty strongly about the idea
8016624 the u s a isnt on the short term radar as an anticipated market for us but with the right product it would be good to return there
8016625 the significant structural and economic changes in the marketplace are prompting all automakers to further refine actions to respond to these pressures
8016626 at bmw were responding with a number of internal efficiency improvements to offset our increased costs so that we can keep this price increase modest
8016627 all the parts of the internet are on the iphone
8016628 believed that it was clear that the reference in the ad to all parts of the internet referred to internet site availability not to every aspect of functionality available on every website
8016629 we considered that because the ad had not explained the limitations viewers were likely to expect to be able to see all the content on a website normally accessible through a pc rather than just having the ability to reach the website
8016630 we concluded that the ad gave a misleading impression of the internet capabilities of the iphone
8016631 el primer pas per apropar el patrimoni al visitant de siurana un espai natural singular i excepcional que fins ara no comptava amb cap publicaci daquestes caracter stiques la guia s un exemple de com societat civil i administraci p blica es posen al servei de la cultura per tal de donar resposta a una demanda cultural molt concreta
8016632 gr inne conole reflects on the implications of web 2 0 for education and offers two new schemas for thinking about harnessing the potential of technologies
8016633 a lot of people inside and outside of the clinton campaign expected her to be a very formidable and eventually a successful candidate
8016634 so she had both the benefit of and the burden of lots of expectations
8016635 have you dealt with the chance that you wont be the nominee
8016636 the idea that if you look and act like a presidential nominee then people are gonna come to think of you that way
8016637 the problem with that strategy is that its easily shattered
8016638 you know this is very personal for me its not just political its not just public i see whats happening and we have to reverse it
8016639 clinton was at her absolute best at that point clinton basically tossed her advisors overboard
8016640 the reason shes a u s senator the reason shes a candidate for president the reason she might be a front runner is her husband messed around
8016641 and from that moment forward clinton really didnt have the resources to compete in the feb 5th states the way obama did
8016642 i mean you can point to that period in february as basically having been the deciding time in the race
8016643 her message didnt match the moment the change message that barack obama had from day one was that message for this moment

8016693 the therapist will readily find the concomitant diagnoses without realising there is the compounding issue of pathological computer use
8016694 given enough exposure to virtual reality people cannot help but begin to question whether their real lives are merely simulations of life the concept is subversive and potentially toxic to the human mind more over it combines in a particularly noxious way with compulsive computer use when technology is used compulsively it soaks up at least 10 to 12 hours a day it redefines relationships to include virtual entities and objects like the computer itself it encourages processing emotion through the computer
8016695 people sometimes prostitute out their avatars they participate in sex for virtual money what if someone only selected virtual prostitutes that were designed to look like children certainly this is an enactment of which a therapist should be aware would this suggest a risk of paedophilia in real life or does discharging the impulse in the virtual world in effect prevent it from emerging in the real world we can theorise but we do not actually know this is not some thought experiment it happens and we need answers
8016696 originally thought was bad but has realized is just different

8016717 such findings have implications for how people interact especially during joint activities
8016718 for instance if you want your boss to think you are particularly skilful at some joint task it is best to perform this in a way that allows him to undertake his aspect of the task easily your bosss more fluent processes will be attributed back to your performance
8016719 do the hard parts of a task for your boss so he can do the easy parts and this will make him think youre good at your job

8016727 there is still a lot we dont know the investigations are continuing
8016728 but we are saying it has been compounded in this country because nobody has faith in where this government is headed
8016729 but we were able to put forward policies which dealt with those issues and got us through the woods
8016730 the problem now is that sure these international factors exist as they did when we were in government
8016731 but it is the governments incapacity to deal with them which is really scaring business at the moment
8016732 i thought he was a really cool person and this was way before he was even a presidential candidate and i liked him a lot
8016733 he invited me to washington and i went we talked about boxing were both boxing fanatics and when i talked to him i never felt beneath him he looks directly at me when hes speaking to me and we have the same level of respect for each other
8016734 that broke my heart and i went man this guy lived it hes not just going hey i want your vote he lived it
8016735 yet if people concluded that parting between the brothers was inevitable we will assist in their amicable separation
8016736 brian reich and dan solomon have ground the lens that so many of us have been waiting for a way to view and profit from the infusion of new communication media into our personal and professional lives comprehensive yet eminently readable i came away from reading media rules feeling as though the fog on a highway had just lifted and i could resume driving at top speed
8016737 the means of mass communication have always been owned by or controlled by governments or corporations but thats not true anymore now there is a new reality created by a horrible beautiful accident the smashup occurred at the intersection of digital technology and the internet and at the moment of impact the means of mass communication fell out of the hands of the media elite and fell into the hands of potentially every person on the planet now people can tell their own stories this book helps you understand how
8016738 everyone who consumes creates and cares about the messages that infuse our lives should read media rules reich and solomon put the me in media and the media in immediate this stuff matters to us all and it matters now read these rules and the authors will inspire you to join the conversation syndicate your own knowledge and work with a set of rules we all are shaping every day

8016743 had reached agreement on the terms of a recommended pre conditional cash offer for the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of imperial energy
8016744 imperial energys directors are pleased to be able to reach an agreement with ovl and intend unanimously to recommend shareholders accept the proposed offer
8016745 the acquisition represents an important addition to ovls operations and we believe ovls financial strength and technical expertise will enhance the attractive growth potential of the business in the tomsk region in siberia
8016746 for about a year now our people had been working on this transaction and we hope everything is sorted out in time
8016747 the chinese may still emerge with a last minute bid however as things stand ovl appears to have clinched the deal as it has better relations with russia
8016748 we do not know where to go we absolutely do not have any idea we will just follow instructions
8016749 we have danced throughout the night and there is no scope for any food or sleep but we still feel fresh
8016750 my dream has come true at last what i could not achieve in my life my ward has been able to achieve i am thankful to the media that it is giving so much attention to wrestling
8016751 i have prepared kheer for him he loves it so much
8016752 this is the game and i think its important to keep perspective
8016753 and if this is the toughest thing i have to face in life i think ill have a very easy life theres bound to be more peaks and valleys along the way and but i think this has helped prepare me for those peaks and valleys that ill face further in life
8016754 my goal in all this was never to get the approval of everybody
8016755 i think its very easy for a lot of people to sit back and say i would have done this or i would have done that i think if you went and asked people a bunch of my peers if theyd do the same thing i think a lot of them would say yes
8016756 the medal will collect dust just like any other piece of hardware
8016757 its about the journey that youve gone on for me the medal was nice and like i said it was unbelievable just to be on that podium but its been about the journey to get there
8016758 i love my country i love what we stand for i dont know how many times i have to say that people keep asking me that i mean ill live the rest of my life here and the fortunate thing for me is that i know where i came from and i know where im going which is i think when you know that and you understand that you can pretty much take on anything
8016759 i dont think anybody would have cared if i was the 12th player on the bench
8016760 i think a lot of people thought i deserved to be on usa basketball
8016761 people think im apple pie and hot dogs and hamburgers and cheeseburgers on the fourth of july
8016762 our coaches go and coach over in other countries for the olympics athletes go over to other countries other athletes from other countries come here and win medals for the united states
8016763 so i just dont think people were aware of that so what better way to tell them than this little girl from south dakota
8016764 the rackjobbers didnt want to stock the album because you could see my armpit hair on the cover and then the back cover had the title rock n roll n ger
8016765 i was warned if i didnt airbrush the hair and retitle the song the album wouldnt sell i was never interested in compromise changing easter was never an issue for me
8016766 we respect the right of elected officials such as speaker pelosi to address matters of public policy that are before them but the interpretation of catholic faith has rightfully been entrusted to the catholic bishops given this responsibility to teach it is important to make this correction for the record
8016767 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8016768 they were extremely successful years we did every possible tv show we did it all there were ups and downs like in everything but ralph was my friend and a great singer and i have the greatest admiration for him
8016769 ralph was very humorous he was a very funny cat actually i mostly played the straight man and he played a bit of a buffoon type
8016770 weird things your body does that are interesting to bring up in a conversation
8016771 what is going on is green somehow being discriminated against
8016772 a lot of black people are surprised they know it and a lot of white people are surprised because they didnt know everybody knew it
8016773 it shows a lot about how universal some good songs are
8016774 if you strip all the production away from it and just play that song as an acoustic beat its just really a beautiful song lyrically and musically
8016775 it was literally like a week after we finished it and cut it
8016776 a good friend of mine in chicago was like oh yeah thats an anthony david joint
8016777 to think other musicians rate your work highly enough to want to commit it to their own catalog is quite a compliment
8016778 recent appearance on the today show s summer concert series which drew one of the biggest crowds the network has seen for such a show
8016779 get your biscuits in the oven and your buns in the bed
8016780 wow greeley estates song titles are just as passe as their screamo
8016781 however since 1978 more than 80 cases of lead poisoning associated with ayurvedic medicine use have been reported worldwide
8016782 several indian manufactured rasa shastra medicines could result in lead and or mercury ingestions 100 to 10 000 times greater than acceptable limits
8016783 among the metal containing products 95 percent were sold by u s web sites and 75 percent claimed good manufacturing practices
8016784 i played it song for his mother and brother we cried our eyes out
8016785 travis has a deep understanding of music and is so creative he did a mash up record where he put his songs together with mine atlantic records is crazy if they dont release it
8016786 it baffles the mind to think that the one part of the medicare system that works the best is being challenged and cut
8016787 this just makes it harder for us to live our mission we will live it but it makes it harder
8016788 a person who might otherwise be going into the hospital into an emergency room or into an intensive care instead receives the care that is right for him or her not undergoing lots of tests when theyre not really needed thats how were able to save the system money
8016789 this isnt a minor mistake and the magnitude is that it affects a childs education
8016790 metro said basically this is the best we can do take it or leave it and we decided to leave it
8016791 were a one car family my two older children go to school in brentwood and my husband takes them when he goes to work
8016792 there isnt any way we could get her there even if we wanted to have four different children in three different schools
8016793 i believe that the extraordinary technology that we now have merits the use of instant replay on a very limited basis
8016794 the system we have in place will ensure that the proper call is made on home run balls and will not cause a significant delay to the game
8016795 we are pleased that we were able to reach this agreement
8016796 following the world series the players will review the matter and then determine what course to take for the future while the use of instant replay is an experiment we hope that over the balance of this season it will prove to be a success
8016797 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now by doing things the way we did it
8016798 but when you look at the technology we now have and the new ballparks and even some of the old ballparks that have been reconfigured theres no question that it was a challenge to the umpires like anything else in life there are times when you need to make an adjustment
8016799 this innovative structure attests to our strategy to partner with multilaterals like the world bank group and introduce viable and cost effective solutions to help customers cope with increasing international trade activities we are excited about this first transaction with habib bank limited and committed to supporting financial institutions in the region
8016800 in an environment where liquidity is scarce we are thrilled to work with ifc and jpmorgan on this trade solution we remain committed to our clients and constantly look for alternative sources of funding to facilitate trade
8016801 creating and delivering this structure demonstrates our leadership in providing world class solutions tailored to our clients needs we plan to expand our capabilities in pakistan and look forward to working closely with clients to implement new financing ideas
8016802 we are pleased to partner with jpmorgan to support habib bank limiteds expanding trade business we will continue to look for innovative ways to boost trade in emerging markets
8016803 he has developed a stress hot spot in his foot and we think it is on the back of his knee injury
8016804 we are dead keen to go live as we have been all year
8016805 we would like to go live and think this game is in the interest of all footy fans the half hour delay will make no different to the crowd numbers
8016806 it is the only interest in the round whether buddy kicks 100 and whether fevola kicks 100
8016807 we think this is a classic case where we should go live it is a dead rubber round and everyone wants to see this game
8016808 there are still tickets available at this point we are selling standing room tickets so the afl wouldnt even entertain the discussion while there are still tickets available
8016809 from our point of view the key thing for us is that the tickets must be sold
8016810 i reckon the mcg surface needs to get better its the worst ive ever seen it
8016811 clearly we had a couple of curtain raisers where we got rain at a time which didnt help it has been a cold winter too it wasnt a really wet year but the timing didnt help
8016812 by the time we get to the finals and grand final it will be fine
8016813 for the past eight or nine years we have seen the ground in pretty good nick by the grand final unlike in previous years where there were great patches going through to the old cricket pitch
8016814 as you would expect healthy debate exists and is pretty standard within any board
8016815 im not sure if youve noticed but we havent won 15 premierships so we need to continue to challenge the status quo
8016816 im not going to comment on individual board members the board is all about football first and well continue to be about putting football first and nothing will distract us
8016817 speculation about archie and the gold coast doesnt surprise me at all hes a very good ceo
8016818 hell have a proper assessment tomorrow and well know where its at
8016819 full steam ahead in 2009 with leigh matthews at the helm
8016820 we will let that run its course before the board makes any further decision
8016821 i am a chairman i am not a coach or expert on the intricacies of the game and leigh matthews is a proven coach
8016822 we assess leigh in a holistic sense the way he manages the team coaches the team runs the football department
8016823 we are disappointed with this year we hoped to participate in september but we could easily have had four more wins too and been fourth or fifth
8016824 there is not too much in this competition in regards to the middle parts of the ladder
8016825 everyone at the club is disappointed but we move on
8016826 whether jonathan had signed earlier i dont think that impacts on winning or losing a game of football
8016827 we retain the confidence that jonathan will re sign with the brisbane lions
8016828 we have gone down the environmental path and this is a perfect fit for us and visy
8016829 this gives our relationship some real substance and this is something they are the forefront of so we can push their message to the community and the kids
8016830 richard pratt has made a big commitment to the club and been a fantastic person this is just another contribution to the club and its terrific
8016831 everyone is claiming to have the best facilities but it puts us on a par with the best facilities in australia
8016832 if geelong for instance is in a preliminary final and grand final you need to think about that so they get the right breaks and are afforded a full seven days of recovery
8016833 the team that plays on sunday in the first week cant play on friday night the following week and even a saturday game would mean a six day break
8016834 we would want to try to avoid geelong having to do that geelong wont play on sunday of week one because they finished on top
8016835 there will be six melbourne teams there is a chance every final will be played in melbourne
8016836 if there is an appropriate game to play at telstra dome we will play there but if all the games are at a capacity that will exceed telstra dome we will play them at the mcg
8016837 the olympics have had an impact on the figures so its been a great year
8016838 we played some of our biggest games earlier in the year so we are on track to break the attendance but it will be quite tight
8016839 the governor believes that just because the legislatures two months overdue on its job that shouldnt keep californians from voting on these important measures
8016840 time for the governor to stop sending letters and holding press conferences and start getting votes from legislators of his own party so the state can move forward on these critical issues
8016841 only two way to live your life one is as though nothing is a miracle the other is as though everything is a miracle

8017109 today is the peoples revolution day so we want nbt to stop broadcasting
8017110 they shouted get out get out at us repeatedly all 150 of us were rounded up for a short while before police arrived and talked them down to the ground floor
8017111 we will have to wait for the results of the police investigation to find out who these people are
8017112 if they break any law they will be dealt with accordingly
8017113 indigenous resources are becoming more important for security of supply
8017114 but if we find oil its quick and easy to put in small low key production facilities and then tanker the oil out to refineries
8017115 its a prolonged process developing the ideas applying for the licenses and finding partners the first three or four years we were quite resource constrained
8017116 we can operate at 30 to 35 a barrel of crude offshore only the biggest companies could operate at that level
8017117 the era of cheap energy is well and truly dead and therefore britain would do well to get its energy from sensible places and think imaginatively about where those places might be
8017118 there is a huge global grab for energy going on weve got to make sure that britain is protected that we have the energy we need
8017119 its very quiet full of wildlife when you walk along the footpaths youll often come a across a deer
8017120 drilling for oil isnt compatible with a place that should be for quiet contemplation and getting away from urban life
8017121 it is our opinion that 100 million barrels of oil or even more is recoverable from the uk south of england alone possibly more
8017122 this would be advantageous to the country not just for the creation of jobs in the haulage and service maintenance sector for example but also in adding a large amount to the chancellors purse and reducing the uks energy deficit
8017123 i never felt scared not even for a moment i took just ten minutes to settle down
8017124 we dont know right now because thats what goldman is doing
8017125 capital access is more restricted now in the film business than its been in a decade
8017126 because the film business is hit driven there is enormous risk when financing films and the current credit squeeze has lessened investors appetite for risk
8017127 we feel that we closed the merrill lynch deal for ua when the market was a very tough market and we continue to have consultations with financial alternatives in the marketplace for financing an mgm slate
8017128 i was scared for the museum on august 11 i took stalins personal effects in a taxi to the state museum in tbilisi for safe keeping i called the taxi and paid for it myself
8017129 nothing was touched in the stalin museum even though it would have been quite possible to come in through the open windows
8017130 of course the russian soldiers were also here they wanted to visit the museum but we insisted that it was closed and we did not let them visit
8017131 of course we are proud of stalin he was a man of such talent and qualities we need leaders like stalin today he had authority
8017132 compare him with todays leaders like us president george w bush or georgian president mikheil saakashvili
8017133 why did the russians do this to gori it was here that stalin was born without him moscow could not have won the war
8017134 if a person works in a memorial museum and does not respect the person who is being remembered then they should not be working here
8017135 stalin was a great phenomenon he was born in that tiny hovel and then rose up he was a great strategist he won world war ii
8017136 i do not believe the lies about stalin leading the repression no one still knows what the reality was
8017137 we just know one thing that without stalin the world would have been in the hands of hitler these are the real facts
8017138 whilst thousands of people came to join in with the fun and spectacle of carnival once again the event ended with a small minority of people determined to fight and cause trouble
8017139 for over two hours our officers were faced with a hard core mainly of young men who came to carnival not to enjoy the event but to fight commit crime and cause trouble
8017140 this is not the way anyone can want to see the carnival finish
8017141 the current government aims to revive the culture of the early years of the revolution and make the culture of the koran and mosques a priority
8017142 ive always loved dressing up dolls and barbies and i wanted to take it into something else that i loved and i love pets

8017156 i looked at my nephew and said lets get the pump and get out of here
8017157 the top stayed in place but the whole foundation collapsed

8017160 beautiful wetlands behind the house that connected to the kickapoo river
8017161 we sometimes had 20 to 30 egrets standing out there in the water
8017162 old timers say that you just hose out the house and move back in
8017163 were in our sixties and theres a world of difference between going through this when youre in your thirties and when youre older
8017164 that means students and staff were ordered into the hallways until the threat passed

8017170 drink all the water you need to as we can refill at the stream ahead
8017171 this takes out bacteria and a virus that you can catch its a nasty business but this makes the water safe
8017172 i once had a touch of the bacteria and ended up in the hospital a night
8017173 oh i didnt have the filter and drank from what i though was a source but it turned out to be too far down stream
8017174 i heard his house was vandalized yesterday someone threw a rock through his window
8017175 they said it was already handled i swear im no cheney fan but people should be more respectful
8017176 like your kids they walked all this way with out a complaint and they are so polite i bet whoever broke his window is a delinquent
8017177 we count all of the chemicals fertilizers and fuels we also count the co2 released from our process that includes the direct co2 from the fermentation part and the energy part

8017179 corzine dems will tip hat to hillary unite behind obama
8017180 were confident in the system and its worked well for us
8017181 we havent experienced the same type of problems that other states apparently have had we feel like were using one of the most advanced voting systems in the world and its accurate and its secure and easy to use
8017182 i believe i like the paper ballots the best theyre easier you know
8017183 i know its a difficult system going through all that
8017184 but it just seems like a much more accurate system
8017185 we wish i know i do personally we could make it more convenient and electronic where we can tabulate results a lot sooner than what we do
8017186 im sure there are some things we can do to make voters feel more comfortable with the electronic machine versus the paper i think its so inefficient going back to paper and costly
8017187 ive used the machines extensively theyre reliable if operated properly as any machine or computer i think theyre a whole lot safer than paper ballots
8017188 the voting machine process is one that ive come to trust and that i know the democratic party folks trust primarily because we trust the elections staff
8017189 voters in south carolina have nothing to fear their votes will be counted and you can trust the process

8017198 ill drive to your house and well ride to elizabeths bistro together
8017199 it is unfortunate that a major film studio would choose to exploit an ethnic slur as a sensational promotion for a movie mainstreaming a bigoted term in this manner will only serve to legitimise and normalise anti muslim prejudice in our society
8017200 not to force the artist to alter her work but instead to use the occasion of that work as an entry point for meaningful debate and discussion
8017201 she so effectively dramatises the pain inflicted by such language
8017202 this is something many people of non minority descent never have to face
8017203 it seems as if we have changed our driving behaviour rapidly and drastically in the last few months
8017204 theres been a lot of coverage on how to squeeze a few extra miles out of your tank driving slowly is one way to do that
8017205 the unfortunate thing is that the high price of fuel and the recession are accomplishing things that the traffic safety community couldnt accomplish
8017206 that is a silver lining to something thats very bad news to american families and to the economy
8017207 baseball is americas pastime and it should be accessible to all
8017208 baseball fans from across the nation will now have easy access to a new york state gem that fuels local tourism across the state i will continue ensuring that facilities are designed and constructed to provide access to all individuals
8017209 abm recognizing the enormous opportunities in todays global marketplace and its members needs is positioning itself to become the global b to b association
8017210 we are delighted to offer media members the opportunity to experience indias b to b community first hand much like we did in china in late 2006 bringing industry leaders together for a collective sharing of information ideas and challenges and we are thrilled to be working with both bpa worldwide and cross border media on this exciting indian venture abms journeys abroad support our strategic initiative to help our members grow globally and become the global business information association
8017211 given the economic vibrancy that is india and with the opening of media to foreign investment
8017212 there are great opportunities for foreign media firms in the b to b sector to collaborate with their counterparts in india we have been in contact with publishers in india interested in best business practices and sharing their experiences with peers in their b to b markets taking a delegation of our publishing members from around the globe who have an interest in doing business in india will result in precisely that as bpa worldwide is the largest global non profit organization tasked with auditing media in more than 30 countries our incoming indian publishers may have an interest in reciprocating and visiting other countries in which they may have an interest in expanding their brands
8017213 i am particularly impressed with the enthusiasm expressed by indian publishers who have pledged full support by way of sponsorships
8017214 in fact i see 2009 as a turning point in indias b to b publishing industry
8017215 with home heating costs set to soar this winter local residents must be able to shop around for the most affordable heating oil prices they should not worry about companies automatically renewing their contracts behind their backs

8017225 i will not discuss anything outside of my mourning and sympathy for the upshaw family
8017226 this is a significant step for me to get back out on the practice field
8017227 i think it will be wonderful to see the bulk of our athletes there and particularly our gold medal winner scottie brennan
8017228 im not going to discuss what peter and i talk about apart from the economy and the obvious fact that treasurer mr wayne swan doesnt seem to have much idea of what hes doing with australias economy
8017229 i have a very high regard for peter im fortunate to be able to attend and address a dinner in his honour in melbourne on friday night this week and well have to just wait and see
8017230 in two years time you and i will be sitting here having an interview in a pre election environment
8017231 in fact wed like to see it go a little bit further
8017232 well who knows he may be announcing some new intergalactic agreement of some kind or other you never know whats going to come out
8017233 what i would like to see him do is focus on the real economic issues
8017234 hes got to tell the australian people why he wants to raise a raft of new inflationary taxes when the government already has a huge surplus when inflation is elevated and every one of these taxes will put upward pressure on inflation
8017235 o god i could be bounded in a nut shell and count myself a king of infinite space were it not that i have bad dreams
8017236 about 30 to 60 minutes of talk time on your cellphone after six hours of cumulative motion

8017238 s ndergaard goes beyond the walls of the private sphere following the women and the fly on the wall
8017239 to avoid the obvious problems that will occur when the republican party raises these issues after obama is nominated
8017240 multi citizenship with responsibilities owed to and allegiance to other countries
8017241 apparently a normal restriction to avoid births during a flight
8017242 voters donated money goods and services to elect a nominee and were defrauded by sen obamas lies and obfuscations
8017243 if the dnc officers had performed one ounce of due diligence we would not find ourselves in this emergency predicament one week away from making a person the nominee who has lost their citizenship as a child and failed to even perform the basic steps of regaining citizenship as prescribed by constitutional laws
8017244 for candidates of either party to become the nominee when there is any question of the ability to serve if elected
8017245 do not believe in anything simply because you have heard it do not believe in anything simply because it is spoken and rumored by many do not believe in anything simply because it is found written in your religious books do not believe in anything merely on the authority of your teachers and elders do not believe in traditions because they have been handed down for many generations but after observation and analysis when you find that anything agrees with reason and is conducive to the good and benefit of one and all then accept it and live up to it
8017246 the whole secret of existence is to have no fear never fear what will become of you depend on no one only the moment you reject all help are you freed
8017247 when you realize how perfect everything is you will tilt your head back and laugh at the sky
8017248 there were three former staff members who were listed on the search warrant that was served on me in early july and we facilitated the gathering of material for police
8017249 the college received some internet material which contained allegations that i think are linked to the ones that are currently taking place
8017250 those matters were referred to the police some years ago
8017251 those circumstances where people have betrayed trust it is a matter of grave concern and shame and it needs to be addressed comprehensively in order to protect children in the future
8017252 i can assure parents that this school is committed to the most thorough child protection measures that we have been implementing for some considerable period of time
8017253 we work closely with authorities in the area of child protection we are committed to protecting children wherever we can
8017254 weve had five people come forward that formed part of the initial investigation
8017255 and as a consequence to those five people coming forward weve identified another eight people so at this stage were speaking to 13 people
8017256 what we can say at this stage is that there is a number of lines of inquiry that have come from the initial inquiries
8017257 there are a number of inquiries continuing and there are some suspects involved
8017258 i have no way of knowing how this was done
8017259 it is a problem and i do think it needs to be investigated
8017260 i feel bad about what i did but it is in the past ive joined a good church and i do not have a problem i have not tried to hide it but i dont feel state resources and state systems should be used to intimidate me or my wife
8017261 at first i just thought it was the usual political games
8017262 when the story came out about the thp we began to take it more seriously the dominoes seem to continue to fall this is looking more and more like someone illegally accessed these records
8017263 pursuant to rule 16 of the tennessee rules of criminal procedure the names are not being release at this time but will be turned over to the district attorney when the investigation is completed
8017264 it is disappointing to me it is not a statute but a rule perhaps we could look at the quick ability to amend the rule i think the citizens who have been violated through an illegal background search deserve to know what happened to them
8017265 stratton bone and the bone campaign do not play those kinds of politics
8017266 i saw him target the wrong mob he let name die he pulled aggro
8017267 every time someone calls it an itouch a cute kitten dies
8017268 you dont get what you deserve you get what you negotiate
8017269 after discovering that thermal expansion of steel from a low temperature fire led to the collapse of world trade center building 7
8017270 we started realizing that other metal objects might also be at risk
8017271 we also determined that car engines airplane engines and boat engines could all suddenly fail due to thermal expansion
8017272 indeed we soon realized that could lead to catastrophic failure other than perhaps those used in freezers
8017273 the data paint a fascinating picture of the manner in which emerging technology has re shaped the attitudes and behavior of contemporary travelers
8017274 and it is clear that tech savvy travelers display a significantly different market profile than travelers who are less wired
8017275 the implications of this work for marketers of travel services are quite profound
8017276 they not only suggest the need for a fresh approach to media strategies that will reach this growing audience but raise provocative questions about the influence of the user generated content that is now flourishing online
8017277 more travelers concerned about the economy gasoline prices and rising airfares are opting to travel by train bus motorcycle and cruise ship to their holiday weekend destinations
8017278 this trend points to a desire on the part of the american public to seek alternatives to flying and driving to enjoy the traditional end of summer vacation
8017279 weve got a whole variety of stunts and things that are intended to manage a 24 hour news cycle but we dont have real decisions which affect australians as far as their cost of living pressures
8017280 weve got no no clear strategic economic direction for the rest of this term of government and from our perspective mr rudd is now having us believe hes going to go to the press club and give us his direction for the country
8017281 the only things that the government has done since the election are the continuation or the implementation of howard government policies or symbolic things like ratifying kyoto and saying sorry in the parliament
8017282 he might as well be speaking mandarin for all the sense he makes
8017283 hes got to tell the australian people why he wants to raise a raft of new inflationary taxes when the government already has a huge surplus when inflation is elevated and every one of these taxes will put upward pressure on inflation
8017284 what we are doing is tackling inflation the imf has recognised that
8017285 the budget we brought down has put downward pressure on inflation
8017286 inflation has been fuelled in recent times by spikes in the oil prices and so on thats why we bought down the budget that we did
8017287 and the budget is reducing taxation as a share of gdp in the economy
8017288 it beggars belief that you can take 2 5 billion off the bottom line of a company like woodside and not have that passed onto australians in other ways
8017289 as far as im concerned hes been very supportive and working hard for the people of higgins
8017290 i dont believe that there is anyone who would do a better job in the current circumstances than brendan

8017297 officers have not yet been able to enter the property due to the severity of the fire but will be carrying out a search as soon as the building is deemed to be safe
8017298 the occupants of the house have not been accounted for and we are appealing for mr foster mrs foster and kirsty to get in touch if they are out there
8017299 i am also keen to hear from anyone who might know of their whereabouts or who can help us establish their movements over the bank holiday weekend anybody who was with them at social events during the past few days is asked to please contact police as a matter of urgency on 08457 444888
8017300 it is a large site and the force helicopter was utilised in the search the search of the house is expected to take some time due to the severity of the damage
8017301 if anyone saw or heard suspicious persons or vehicles in the area which is off the road between maesbrook and knockin during the early hours of today i would urge them to please get in touch
8017302 information can also be passed on anonymously via crimestoppers on 0800 555111 if people know something but do not want to be identified
8017303 publishing in the mainstream media is annoying for example half my editors worsen my submissions
8017304 in the mainstream media i rarely get to write about what i most want to write about a truly honest examination of race in the workplace that schools and colleges are unfair to boys and men that reverse discrimination is a net negative to society and that education especially higher education is americas most overrated product and desperately needs reinvention
8017305 i might not agree with all your contentions but i sure respect your bravery and integrity in forwarding them
8017306 this case in particular demonstrates the hard work undertaken by the investigation team at telford amp wrekin which was under very difficult and frustrating circumstances the weight of witness and documentary evidence were clearly factors that informed the defendant to plead guilty
8017307 we hope that this sends out a strong message to individuals committing or thinking about committing benefit fraud we will always follow up cases of suspected benefit fraud
8017308 we are taking a tough line on benefit fraudsters because they steal 700 million a year money that should be spent on those who really need it
8017309 closer working with our partners such as telford amp wrekin council means that we know where and when people try to commit benefit fraud cheats should be warned we are now saying no ifs no buts all benefit theft is a crime and those found breaking the law face a criminal record
8017310 its owner was with a group of friends and had placed the bike worth 1 000 nearby it had not been locked and someone picked it up and rode away
8017311 if anyone has been offered this bike for sale or knows of its whereabouts now would ask them to please contact shrewsbury police on 08457 444888 or the anonymous crimestoppers number 0800 555111
8017312 people should also make sure their bike is secured to an immovable object when unattended with a good quality bike lock
8017313 an insecure bike takes just seconds to pick up and ride away whereas if a thief has to get through a sturdy lock it takes much longer and is more difficult increasing the chances of them being disturbed
8017314 we would encourage as many people as possible to take advantage of the surgery and to come and talk to us about anything that concerns them whether it be incidents of crime or crime prevention advice
8017315 people will be able to talk to us in confidence and individuals reporting matters will be given the opportunity of reporting incidents to us anonymously if they so wish
8017316 we hope the surgeries will help us to meet the diverse members of the community and to provide reassurance and ultimately increase the number of incidents reported to us in the future
8017317 the victim has been left very upset by the incident and i would urge anyone who might have information which could be connected to our inquiry to please contact me on 08457 444888
8017318 people should also make sure that they keep valuables safe and secure when out and about and that they are aware of anybody acting suspiciously nearby
8017319 dont carry large amounts of cash and do not keep it all in the one place but spread it around your person
8017320 keep items such as purses mobile phones and mp3 players at the very bottom of a zipped or otherwise closed bag out of easy reach for thieves
8017321 offenders often target victims in crowded places and i would urge shop staff to also be alert to anyone acting suspiciously around their business or customers
8017322 this was a vicious assault it was a busy night in wellington and i would encourage anybody in the area that may have seen anything to come forward i would also appeal to those responsible for this attack to hand themselves in

8017377 most working families today do not have homes that have anywhere near ten rooms john mccain has ten houses many working people in america have to work two or three jobs to provide for their families and pay their car loans john mccain hops on a private jet is it any wonder why mccain champions a george bush agenda of cutting taxes for corporations and the wealthy helping oil companies turn record profits and leaving working families to fend for themselves mccains velvet world leaves him utterly unprepared to make the tough choices we need to restore the middle class and ensure that everyone in america has quality affordable health insurance
8017378 the public doesnt know who on earth john mccain is

8017392 the concept of psychological androgyny implies that it is possible for an individual to be both compassionate and assertive both expressive and instrumental both feminine and masculine depending upon the situational appropriateness of these various modalities and it further implies that an individual may even blend these complementary modalities in a single act such as the ability to fire an employee if the circumstances warrant it but with sensitivity for the human emotion that such an act inevitably produces

8017411 publishing in the mainstream media is annoying for example half my editors worsen my submissions
8017412 in the mainstream media i rarely get to write about what i most want to write about a truly honest examination of race in the workplace that schools and colleges are unfair to boys and men that reverse discrimination is a net negative to society and that education especially higher education is americas most overrated product and desperately needs reinvention

8017428 based on what we think theyre going to do i think itll be a different role particularly with them having the kind of running back patrick jackson they have
8017429 he definitely had some great potential outstanding feet great hands but had a lot to learn so now its going to be starting all over with him
8017430 i think we are equal to last year at this point and in some areas maybe ahead at that position

8017432 clearly i want to win all the time but ive learned that sometimes its more advantageous to score as many points as possible and live to fight another day
8017433 my aim is still to win the world championship and you dont do that by ending up in the barriers after making an opportunistic move
8017434 in valencia we scored a very useful haul of points and ive actually come away from the weekend having extended my lead in the championship despite losing two points to felipe massa
8017435 im mentally strong enough to be able to deal with that and im more relaxed about it too im playing a long game
8017436 i think the organisers did a great job getting it ready and i can really see valencia growing into a great track it certainly wasnt your average street circuit it was very flat wide and fast so almost the complete opposite of monaco
8017437 the most difficult thing about the track was its dustiness it was very slippery so if you locked your brakes you could find yourself sliding quite a bit as i found out on a couple of occasions
8017438 ill watch for the notice in the meantime i beg
8017439 if anyone saw persons acting suspiciously in the area around these times or witnessed the thefts taking place i would ask them to please contact me on 08457 444888

8017447 when the four officers arrived they saw blood on the banisters leading to the house and could hear a female being assaulted inside screaming and crying for her life
8017448 the assailant initially attempted to prevent the officers forcing entry by barricading the door
8017449 only after a very violent struggle using baton strikes a cs spray discharge and the combined efforts of the officers were the mans hands eventually prised from her neck
8017450 the man continued to struggle and fight the officers and it took some considerable force to fully restrain him to the ground

8017456 new and current smugmug members can add geo tagging and hot spot capabilities to their existing eye cards for one year the company will discount its membership plans by 20 percent through the end of this year
8017457 the eye fi card appears to a digital camera exactly like any other sd card you simply take photos and the eye fi accepts the data from the camera as it should but simultaneously takes another kind of snapshot it records a list of the names and signal strengths of any wi fi gateways in the vicinity these wi fi snapshots are used later
8017458 i dont cover companies financial dealings often but eye fi is always worth highlighting as they appear to be the only smart entrant in the entire universe of cameras with wi fi and theyre not even a camera maker
8017459 eye fi said it would use its cash infusion to develop its portfolio expand distribution and scale its organization and market development activities
8017460 the mountain view calif based company has raised 11 million in a second round of funding the lead investors include translink capital and lms capital existing investors opus capital and shasta ventures also participated to date eye fi has raised 17 5 million the vcs note that the service is dead simple you just take photos and theyre automatically uploaded to a service of your choice

8017491 the shootout has proved to be an exciting addition to hockey at a variety of levels and we are anxious to bring it into college hockey the drama it creates is very popular with fans and importantly todays players love it
8017492 at the same time the ncaa rules and ice hockey committees have allowed us to implement this tie breaker protocol so that every regular season league game will have a winner while preserving the integrity of the national rankings because ccha games decided by a shootout will still be considered ties for ncaa purposes bonus points awarded will impact the conference standings only
8017493 this is a bold decision and i think its a great one
8017494 college hockey is already one of the most exciting sports in america adding the shootout just adds to the excitement
8017495 as administrators it isnt our place to change things without adequate input for the past two years weve received feedback from all constituencies weve also been given a direction to make decisions that reward speed creativity and skill while maintaining the games safety and integrity by allowing shootouts the rules committee gave conferences a means to enhance game excitement we are always careful when making changes as there can be unintended consequences in this case the ccha council was comfortable that shootouts will have no direct impact on the rpi and also felt that shootouts are in the best interest of the game at this time
8017496 im excited about our league adopting it and its going to add a tremendous amount of excitement to the game fans will really love it and players love working on shootout moves in practice so theyre going to love doing it in a game so its a win win situation when you look at it from that perspective
8017497 shootouts are going to be great for our fans they will keep people excited and in their seats right up until the last goal or save its going to be something that they will keep talking and raving about
8017498 a shootout may be conducted at the end of the five minute overtime period for advancement purposes in conference games or by mutual consent of both teams
8017499 among the ancients a fabulous bird called the phoenix is described by early writers such as clement herodotus and pliny in size and shape it resembled the eagle but with certain differences the body of the phoenix is one covered with glossy purple feathers and the plumes in its tail are alternately blue and red the head of the bird is light in color and about its neck is a circlet of golden plumage at the back of its back the phoenix has a crest of feathers of brilliant color only one of these birds was supposed to live at a time with its home in the distant parts of arabia in a nest of frankincense and myrrh the phoenix it is said lives for 500 years and at its death its body opens and the new born phoenix emerges because of this symbolism the phoenix is generally regarded as representing immortality and resurrection

8017536 here where even miles high columns of flame spewed ceaselessly by awesome energy pits fail to penetrate the eternal darkness joy is unknown and hope is a capital offense
8017537 to some these puny creatures are legends the stories of their greatness inspiring others to greatness as well perhaps the time has come to strike at the core of the problem to destroy the very concept of such legends
8017538 how can you stand there tonight and talk about a nice park when the property owner is completely opposed to you being there in the first place
8017539 there are people who are upset and have concerns because its their land
8017540 i am not convinced at the genuineness of their appearance
8017541 everyone is just going to vote their conscience so some people will vote for hillary clinton some people will vote for barack obama
8017542 hillary came to our conference and made the pitch about uniting behind barack and thats what weve done
8017543 99 9 of the people who are for hillary are going to be supporting barack
8017544 everybody wants to get to the same place and that is a unified convention
8017545 waxaa naga goan inaan soo qabano barre hiiraale ama aan soo dilno
8017546 i hope me and sanjeev helped you live your dream because you helped us live ours
8017547 hi ho hi ho its off to work we go
8017548 we have no idea how to spin this miserable season either
8017549 from our it support staff it included the following very terse message along with the usual greeting etc
8017550 cold is good and when it comes to the ocean ecosystem the colder that upwelling gets the better it is for all the animals in the food chain
8017551 everybody thinks the water shortage only affects the san joaquin valley and that everything up here is hunky dory
8017552 our water district has been trying to get some water transferred from a neighboring district that has available water
8017553 the caller had no idea that there was a contract water district in the north part of the state that was water short
8017554 that means a gross income loss of more than 130 000 a year
8017555 and were spending on additional micro sprinklers well upgrades new piping and more water management equipment
8017556 theres a lot of well work going on up here
8017557 i reworked two wells myself and put a new well in last winter weve got a retired well that were working to bring back online were trying to get ready for next year and the possibility of continuing drought
8017558 because theres no more open field burning we chop our straw and disk it back into the dirt to help with decomposition
8017559 but now my water district has indicated we may not have water available for winter straw decomp
8017560 if we cant get the water im not sure what well do
8017561 we may be able to work more of the straw into the soil and use that moisture but it really doesnt work that well
8017562 but the really scary thing is if we have another dry winter we assume there will be continued cuts in water which means well only be able to plant half the acres
8017563 i switched to less valuable crops that use less water the switch to less valuable crops means more than a 50 000 hit for me added to that i hoped for spring rains for my safflower crop which i lost because of the drought another 20 000 hit
8017564 for now folks to the north of the delta are not laboring under the same burden of court ordered restrictions like the folks south of the delta but they could find they face additional water supply constraints and that may not be too far off
8017565 even with the best intentions and technology were still at the mercy of the clouds
8017566 senator hillary clinton was our first choice and that of 18 million primary voters but presumptive democratic nominee senator barack obamas pick joe biden is a friend of women and a strong selection for vice president
8017567 we are a grass roots organization bottom up and we did a deliberative process before we did the clinton endorsement
8017568 it wont be long before we have someone in the white house who not only has a heart but has a brain what that means for women is that we will have someone who understands our power
8017569 i know john mccain i know barack obama and i know joe biden
8017570 there are some people hurting from the primary we must be united we cant afford to elect john mccain
8017571 i dont want to talk about the past john mccain has a zero voting record from naral pro choice america
8017572 if you have not read the platform you have to
8017573 it is the strongest i have seen since i learned to read
8017574 a tool to redevelop our downtown but there are other tools as well
8017575 when you do a small area development plan like the downtown master plan is it is not going to identify and address every issue
8017576 it addresses as many of their needs as it possibly could
8017577 but when there is significant public input that went into this plan and now there is significant public disillusion and despair and pessimism and people are saying
8017578 why were we so committed im concerned how we avoid this failure in the future

8017582 i think its a fitting tribute i think its just amazing that a teenager could spearhead this and get it done
8017583 theres something about the feeling of this evening thats so reminiscent of that morning
8017584 it makes me feel honored and humbled at the same time

8017599 the reductions that you see here in cincinnati are actually a reflection of the reductions we have seen at other places in our system especially in the midwest
8017600 its very disappointing that this information was made available ahead of time
8017601 naturally i would have liked to have had a clean slate but i wont question it
8017602 will prompt the mayor to kind of join the team
8017603 oh maybe this is some ploy to get the voters with that pathos emotional appeal
8017604 and barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
8017605 theyll tell them how this time we listened to our hopes instead of our fears how this time we decided to stop doubting and to start dreaming
8017606 barack stood up that day and spoke words that have stayed with me ever since
8017607 it would certainly improve our chances of carrying kentucky in the fall if senator obama would spend some time in kentucky campaigning between now and november
8017608 get him to kentucky as much as possible throughout the campaign
8017609 i think that senator obama is comparable to president kennedy when president kennedy got the nomination
8017610 people dont know a lot about him but they really embraced him once he got the nomination
8017611 imagino que ha de haber recibido alguna carta de alg n ciudadano quien ha de haber pensado que tal vez la primera declaraci n de amlo luego de la muerte del joven mart ha de haber sido esa
8017612 si eso es lo que piensa yo no lo s pero que no lo ha dicho no lo ha dicho
8017613 mccain also has spoken out strongly against russias invasion of the former soviet republic of georgia using obamas absence from the campaign trail during a hawaiian vacation last week to take a hard line against the russian government
8017614 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed

8017616 for the first time in my adult lifetime i am really proud of my country
8017617 its always good when a state has a big economic development announcement like this but this is a rough tough area to compete in
8017618 what this all boils down to is the battery for these vehicles whoever comes up with the lithium battery that can stay charged longer and has more power will win out
8017619 right now i consider zap a small niche player in this when the best battery arrives i doubt if we will see zap in the picture
8017620 he really didnt write so much to publish he wrote because he needed to and he had a lot to say
8017621 i think pat protested war in general and he protested inhumane treatment of anybody at any time
8017622 he was really not a troublemaker pat was gracious always he never really intended to be a troublemaker he was just a good honest man
8017623 he was a wonderful teacher he was an ally in the anti war movement i appreciate him for that
8017624 we learned at our expense not at the customers expense
8017625 ive repaired hundreds thousands of chairs over the years it was never routine
8017626 we did whatever we needed to do to keep things going
8017627 i just feel like i had so much more to learn from pat
8017628 from that point forward i had no knowledge of the direction the project would advance nor did i attend any meetings in which this project was discussed
8017629 even the mere perception of a potential conflict must if possible be avoided
8017630 i was immediately struck by his kindness and warmth which were extremely helpful at that time
8017631 they told clay there would always be a seat at the kelley school of business with his name on it
8017632 honestly when i heard it it was just two or three days after the crash
8017633 i needed to stay home to be close to my family and be there for my mom and family
8017634 there was a warm mutual handshake you could feel it he was very interested in wanting to be here
8017635 i couldnt even believe he was taking time to meet me
8017636 he fit transylvanias profile of an outstanding well rounded student
8017637 you let him know that youre there but that he will not be treated differently than anybody else
8017638 he had a deep sense of personal loss and whenever you have a student like that you choose your words carefully you just try to keep an eye on them and see how theyre progressing
8017639 he did that tremendously well it was a difficult time and being treated as normal as possible helped me with my grief
8017640 theres never been a time when i thought i should bring it up or he should bring it up
8017641 i realized how much i would miss my mom and all my friends i was extremely homesick
8017642 i knew once i came back i was where people cared about me
8017643 hes been primarily in the background but hes there for clay as a mentor
8017644 i just love the horses the scene the good people
8017645 he dont belong in political office blacks dont belong in political office he ought to be shot
8017646 do you think they were really plotting to kill obama
8017647 i dont want to say yes but i dont want to say no
8017648 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
8017649 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
8017650 these are both basically combustion reactions so to first order id expect them to release similar amounts of energy
8017651 more individual u s athletes will carry home gold medals around their neck than any other nation if you want to count it that way
8017652 were fascinated like any other country by gold medals but what is more important in a way is that our team sports do very well
8017653 what kind of dog are you you silly little thing
8017654 i guess were going to keep you we need to give you a name dont we
8017655 this term is all about self confidence the love of peace patriotism openness and friendliness
8017656 spending taxpayer funds in the creation of things named after ourselves while were still here
8017657 i would have a problem if you did it because i dont think that youve been around long enough to inspire a building like this
8017658 pork has been a good investment in west virginia if you look around and see what i have done
8017659 i discovered a local park had been named after me and other legislators without my knowledge
8017660 but that wasnt enough for one legislator who complained that the sign with her name on it wasnt in her campaign colors
8017661 now tell me the truth wouldnt you like a building named after you
8017662 using taxpayer money to build temples to ourselves as public servants is dangerous
8017663 it is entirely appropriate that it remain highway 43 the way i remember it was when i was a boy
8017664 i try to help my community as much as i can
8017665 well id better finish off the whole box before they get stale
8017666 style the book covers the history the harajuku from the late 60s to present day

8017668 ill watch for the notice in the meantime i beg
8017669 ill watch for the notice in the meantime i beg
8017670 and i thought in this day and age people are still saying that
8017671 but i dont think it really exists today i think were past it weve worked too closely with the hispanic and african american communities apis arent that large just 4 percent of the population we have to worked collectively with others
8017672 i was hoping and hoping that someday before i go i would be at a convention when we would nominate a member of the minority as president
8017673 and i hope people of u s can set aside the emotions of the past and look forward to a greater nation of great people im ready to work with everyone and i know that you are so lets workfor barack obama
8017674 i expect progress by the end of this year and solution in the beginning of 2009 if a solution is to be found it will be found in a short time
8017675 we have talked about all issues including administrative issues judicial issues property security execution legislation
8017676 however what we have done so far is to put forward our positions
8017677 give and take and detailed discussions will take place during negotiations
8017678 there is agreement over the fact that there will be two parliaments but there is difference over how parliamentary elections will take place there is agreement over the fact that there will be political equality but there is no complete agreement over how this will be implemented
8017679 during the annan plan negotiations guarantees and security was the only issue on which there was an agreement the greek cypriot side did not even bring up this issue after the failure of the plan however they tried to present this issue as the number one problem former greek cypriot president papadopoulos presented this issue as a serious obstacle because he knew that it is very difficult to change the guarantee agreements therefore this is quite an artificial problem
8017680 there is no agreement over this issue but christofias has announced that he accepts rotating presidency in principle the sides have put forward their positions regarding the duration
8017681 it is a 45 year old problem and it closely concerns every individual it is a difficult complex and an expensive problem
8017682 they will become proposals on the negotiations table the positions may also change on the negotiations table
8017683 the map will only be discussed provided there is progress towards an agreement
8017684 because discussing the map would create difficulties in our daily lives it would affect the economic activities

8017706 the alhambra has been around since 1996 but still impresses thanks to its car like driving dynamics comfort and genuine versatility but what makes the alhambra a clear winner is the fact that it always came with excellent standard equipment and is fantastic value for money
8017707 we are really very pleased to win the mpv award for the alhambra and it adds to the list of used accolades for the seat range the arosa won the best city car in 2000 and 2001 and the leon was a close runner up in the small family car category
8017708 we have not only improved profitability but also substantially reduced debt improved cash flow and significantly strengthened our balance sheet
8017709 when one of these things goes off we see it coming we see it peak and we see it go away that will provide us tremendous insights into the physics of these objects

8017714 we are having to introduce him to 20 year olds who are smoking out of apple bongs
8017715 im disappointed too but what im most disappointed about are the thousands of people across our state who lost their jobs because of the inept economic policies of this administration thats something we must change this november
8017716 when he called me he couldnt have been nicer he said a lot of very complimentary things and he said look im gonna need you in the campaign im gonna need your help around the country and so i told him id be willing to do both
8017717 im going to go out there and say exactly what i think and i think thats my job and hope that goes well
8017718 all this time i spent with barack in personal settings we knew each other but we didnt know each other well you would really really like him as a human being
8017719 someone actually came in on our lot and used a hole punch to damage the windows and only windows
8017720 probably a little over 50 60 000 worth of damage to this lot
8017721 anytime that someone does this amount of damage to anybodys property whether it is a car dealership or personal property obviously this is personal property its a pretty serious deal
8017722 wed just like to catch the guy and make sure he doesnt do it to anybodys house or home or windshield
8017723 you can see the squad is now starting to look stronger with the return of ryan javier and lucas the manager has a lot more options now
8017724 there is still some time in the transfer window and i think in that time you will start to see our squad get to full strength
8017725 i think there will be another arrival before the deadline
8017726 the managers obviously got his eye on two or three different players and i think it would help us if another new face came in
8017727 sometimes you need the kick up the backside similar to the one we had against liege you dont want to go into the season a little bit complacent and no one could argue against the fact liege were the better team on the night
8017728 it was certainly a wake up call for us and the best thing about it was that we didnt get beat
8017729 were still in the tie and know that at anfield we will play a lot better liege will also find it more difficult
8017730 last season we only lost once at home but had too many draws which isnt good enough
8017731 we have got maximum points from our two games and still havent played anywhere near the level we are capable of we know we can improve but we kept going until the end against middlesbrough and showed great character
8017732 we have received two interesting offers both of which are from english clubs
8017733 what we always do is defend our interests we wont sell any player if the bid is not the amount we have asked for
8017734 if they want albert riera theyll have to pay what espanyol is asking
8017735 while luis garcias possible transfer to benfica has stalled this one could be in its final hours
8017736 if someone does leave within the next 24 hours they will be replaced
8017737 there is a team which is offering what we have asked and another one which isnt but the player is interested in the one which is offering the least
8017738 they are definitely the toughest opponents weve had in a qualifier
8017739 i know people expect us to get through but its not as if were playing a mickey mouse team the belgian league has a lot of quality and their champions are used to getting into the group stages
8017740 they caught us a bit cold in the first leg their manager said we were sleeping but they deserve credit for the way they played they were spot on tactically hitting us on the counter attack we didnt play well and we know well have to improve tactically
8017741 any side which can keep fernando torres and robbie keane as quiet as they did in the first leg has quality we didnt have any chances in the game
8017742 it would be unthinkable for us not to be in the champions league to go through will give us momentum and confidence
8017743 steven gerrard probably had one of the worst games ive seen him play but you have got to keep him on the pitch
8017744 the ball dropped to him 18 or 19 yards out and the moment you saw him striding on to it you knew where it was going he tucked it away very well and the keeper had no chance
8017745 we say it all the time but if you can nick a result when youre not playing well and this was not liverpool playing particularly well today
8017746 thats twice now theyve done it and that was what was missing last season if they keep nicking those results when theyre not playing at their best when they do hit form theyve got a chance
8017747 but gareth southgate will be beside himself that middlesbrough havent got a least a point out of that today
8017748 ive got to give mike riley credit because for the first goal it started out on the right wing and xabi alonso tried to cross it but the ball was blocked by the arm of gary oneil
8017749 he went to put his whistle in his mouth but saw the ball breaking for jamie carragher who took a touch and went on to strike it
8017750 it was disappointing for pogatetz after such a good game but it just flicked off his arm and that has taken it past ross turnbull in goal
8017751 everything is going well and a deal can be reached
8017752 the differences we have are ones we can solve and in the next two or three days there has to be a solution because there is no more time
8017753 one team is offering what we want and another one isnt
8017754 but the player is interested in the one that is offering the least
8017755 we havent been playing unbelievably in the last two games
8017756 but as long as youre winning games thats the most important thing the flowing football will follow
8017757 a few times we linked up against middlesbrough and we played each other in so theres definitely signs there
8017758 it would have been nice if we had of scored but i think it doesnt matter with strikers as long as the team is winning that is the most important thing
8017759 its like you know having dinner with three people for seven years and getting quite bored of each other
8017760 so its having a fourth person new opinion i think its gonna be interesting
8017761 kara has a good reputation of a having hits and b having an opinion and thats a good combination
8017762 concerned about the audience and acceptance time will tell well see
8017763 i know kara and she speaks her mind so she will be speaking her mind
8017764 i wore pajamas the girls wore negligees and we kind of broke the ice
8017765 you cant ask for any more from a team than to take six points from their first two games of the season and that is exactly what liverpool have done
8017766 sunderland and middlesbrough are going to give a lot of teams problems this season but despite being nowhere near their best liverpool have somehow managed to come up with a way to beat both of them
8017767 in this respect you cant ask any more of rafa benitez and his players they have done just what we all hoped they would do in terms of getting off to a good start
8017768 but there is no doubt they are going to have to improve if their winning run is going to continue because their opening two performances have not been of the standard expected
8017769 winning when you are not playing well is something you have to be able to do if you are going to challenge for the title but it isnt something that can be sustained too long
8017770 if youre sloppy in possession and not creating many chances then it is inevitably winning matches is difficult
8017771 thats what happened against middlesbrough on saturday when liverpool didnt get anywhere near hitting the kind of form they are capable of they could so easily have dropped valuable points
8017772 the fact that they didnt though says a lot about the character of the team and im sure thats one of the big plus points that benitez is taking from the game
8017773 when things arent going well you need your big game players to pull something out of the bag and thats what jamie carragher and steven gerrard did
8017774 when things arent going well it can sometimes be easy to just accept that it isnt going to be your day but thats never going to be the case with players like carragher and gerrard
8017775 in taking the initiative they led by example and it was thanks to their interventions towards the end of the game that liverpool were able to come away with three points they might otherwise have missed out on
8017776 the concern is that liverpool cannot continue to rely so heavily on their captain and vice captain and other players are going to have to start chipping in if the good start to the season is to be maintained
8017777 i know the fans will be concerned about liverpools current form but the most important thing at this stage is to get points on the board
8017778 if you do that then it breeds confidence and it sends out a message to the rest of the league that you are going to be hard to beat
8017779 but liverpool need to get better and i believe that they will especially if benitez can add a bit of width to his side before the transfer window closes
8017780 there were welcome signs against middlesbrough that fernando torres is beginning to strike up an understanding with new strike partner robbie keane
8017781 you could see that they were starting to get used to each others movement and were picking up their running off the ball
8017782 there was one moment in the first half when keane went on a little run and picked torres out with a perfect pass with the outside of his right foot
8017783 torres wasnt able to take the chance on this occasion but at least it showed that they are getting to know one another better and that bodes well for the future
8017784 if these two hit it off and ive got no reason to doubt that they will then it will really benefit the team as a whole and im sure theyre both working really hard to make it happen
8017785 anyone who saw the first leg of liverpools champions league qualifier against standard liege a fortnight ago will know the belgians are no pushovers
8017786 standard are the champions of their country and that means they deserve respect especially after the way they performed against the reds in liege
8017787 had it not been for pepe reinas heroics then standard would be coming to anfield tomorrow night with a lead to protect and that would definitely have made the tie even more difficult than it already is for rafa benitezs men
8017788 as things stand liverpool do not have an away goal to fall back on so they will be looking to keep a clean sheet otherwise things could get very tricky
8017789 obviously liverpool are big favourites to go through but they cannot take anything for granted because if they do standard might just take advantage
8017790 importantly though liverpool have encountered this kind of situation so many times in europe in recent seasons so they know exactly what they have to do and how to go about it
8017791 i wouldnt be at all surprised if it is a tight affair because standard looked a well organised and decent side in the first leg but liverpool should have enough know how and experience to get through
8017792 it was just a bad day and we are thinking about qualifying at anfield
8017793 for liverpool the champions league is a huge competition and it would be a disaster not to get through
8017794 nobody in the squad is thinking about anything other than qualifying
8017795 i am always optimistic and i am convinced we will beat standard
8017796 but there are no easy games in europe and we are aware that this match is not decided
8017797 i am not a hero for the penalty in the first match
8017798 i have just done my job for me the penalty was just a part of it
8017799 i am very happy with the result but i am not happy with the performance of the team the last three games we have not played well but we were playing really well during pre season
8017800 if we can bring in new faces then the competition will be better for me and we can improve the main thing for me is the mentality of the players we were trying until the end we were going forward working really hard with determination and that is important
8017801 i will try and find a positive message from these kind of games and it is that we won without playing well last season we played well in a lot of games but never scored the goals from the chances we had
8017802 now we have six points out of six points and when everyone is ready we will play much better and it will be difficult to stop us
8017803 we had a lot of offensive players on the pitch but if you had said to me we would draw then maybe i would have said yes because we had conceded late
8017804 it is always difficult to score two goals in that length of time
8017805 i want to play well but if you dont play well and win then the confidence of the team will stay high it is impossible to play well all the time so you need to keep going
8017806 you have to give credit to middlesbrough they were pretty good and well organised
8017807 they had good players in front and could play good football
8017808 they had players in the wide areas who were good they worked really hard in defence
8017809 i thought he was pretty good the understanding with torres was much better he worked hard with good movements the key is the rest of the team giving them good passes
8017810 that is the reason why nabil was a key player for us
8017811 i was saying to him stay wide stay wide and he offered the wide areas
8017812 dossena was going forward in the first half and arbeloa in the second half but really our wingers are not players who play on the lines
8017813 we have to try through our full backs and keep the other team back
8017814 i think it is important to keep the balance we will try and do our best
8017815 liverpool were starting to get frustrated and there were long balls that were running out of play
8017816 i couldnt ask more from the lads and again when they look back they will realise how close they came to getting a result
8017817 liverpool have the ability to keep going resilience and they have players who can pop up and score important goals as gerrard and torres have done in the last two weeks
8017818 they are what they are we didnt have any fear but we couldnt get the win we wanted
8017819 that is the reason why nabil was a key player for us at the weekend i was saying to him stay wide stay wide and he offered the wide areas
8017820 andrea dossena was going forward in the first half and alvaro arbeloa in the second half but really our wingers are not players who play on the lines we have to try through our full backs and keep the other team back
8017821 dic are not interested in getting involved in man city their interest is only in liverpool football club
8017822 you can see the impact in training they have a really good mentality and they are really happy especially mascherano and lucas because of their medals i think it will be positive for the team
8017823 if everything is okay maybe they could play this weekend they will be around and we will decide but they cannot play in the champions league
8017824 theyre not playing this game so they have time in training and theyll be okay
8017825 everyone knows what a good professional he is he is a nice boy and a good player so everyone is pleased for him its amazing
8017826 they could be the best team weve faced if you look at some of the other games we were much better than the opposition
8017827 but if we do the right things we can be on top of them at anfield we will try to play at a high tempo and im sure theyll try to play on the counter attack i think it will be more or less similar to the first game but the difference will be anfield
8017828 we have to improve at everything set pieces and open play we had a bad game the best thing was the result but this time we have to play better and we have to score goals
8017829 you can know a team but sometimes you dont know exactly how they will play until you get on the pitch you can watch videos and things like that but you do not always know now we know a lot about them so it will be easier to not make any mistakes
8017830 but i wasnt surprised by them i was surprised at how badly we played
8017831 we have a lot of confidence that we will go through we are at anfield and we have to improve and we will improve
8017832 we have training tomorrow and then well decide on the one or two players who have had problems
8017833 if you ask me if i am considering this option the answer is no i am just thinking about winning
8017834 i dont think so i think we have better options but if were desperate we can send anyone up there we can send pepe reina if necessary
8017835 we have received two interesting offers both of which are from english clubs
8017836 what we always do is defend our interests we wont sell any player if the bid is not the amount we have asked for
8017837 if they want albert riera theyll have to pay what espanyol is asking
8017838 there is a team which is offering what we have asked and another one which isnt but the player is interested in the one which is offering the least
8017839 we know we havent been playing unbelievably well in our first two games but as long as youre winning games thats what really matters and im sure the flowing football will follow
8017840 its important that you get off to a good start in the premiership because it is such a competitive league and weve managed to do that
8017841 you have to remember weve only played the first two games of the season and what you have to do at this stage is get points on the board im sure the good football will follow
8017842 you could tell how much our winner meant to the fans the roof came off when my goal went in
8017843 everyone knows that these are the games we have to win if we are going to mount a serious title challenge too many home points were squandered last season
8017844 maybe our fans were thinking of what happened last season when we drew too many games at home
8017845 but this time we have sent out a message that we can produce results like this
8017846 last season we had some bad home results but this time around we have tried very hard to be positive and to make sure such things do not happen again this win shows we can do it
8017847 ive had problems with my groin throughout pre season and things have not gone the way i wanted them to
8017848 i have missed a lot of training and i am a couple of weeks behind the other lads when it comes to match fitness
8017849 the only way i am going to get that edge again is to get out on the pitch and play
8017850 i am not at my best at the moment but i hope the fans will be patient because i am only three weeks away from my best form and fitness
8017851 gerrard has quality he can score the sort of goal he got he has that ability right at the death he has done it before and he will continue to have the mentality to win games at the end
8017852 we sent a lot of players forward the idea was to have many people around their box it does leave us open to a counter attack but it is a gamble we will take
8017853 we know we did not play well but you have to win games like this if you want to be contenders for the title it is a message for everyone for the rest of the season
8017854 last season we would probably have lost or drawn but now we have different qualities and we have many options
8017855 javier will be back with us soon but i do not think he will be in contention to play in europe
8017856 he has spent too much time travelling and playing which makes it difficult to be at your best
8017857 the same thing applied to ryan babel he returned from china last week after holland were knocked out but i only really considered him as a substitute at the weekend
8017858 i have been given a fantastic opportunity to play for the team i supported as a kid and all i want to do is work hard and fight for my place in the team
8017859 we were scoring lots of goals in pre season and the team was improving it was really pleasing
8017860 i thought we were in a good moment but we didnt play well in our last three games that was clear
8017861 if you are asking me if i am considering defeat then the answer is no
8017862 they were good in the first game but we were really poor if we improve and play at our level it will be difficult for them
8017863 if we are winning games and not playing well it means we should find it easier to win games when we do play well
8017864 but the team wasnt good enough around them but they showed they are playing together much better
8017865 ive explored all the perfectly rational reasons people dont like annuities and ive concluded theres something more fundamental
8017866 i just tell clients that theyre buying their own pension
8017867 our display this time will be much much better of that i am confident
8017868 our performance in liege was poor but the result was good we did not concede an away goal and we hope that playing the second leg at anfield will make a massive difference
8017869 the entire team did not play well they liege were organised pressed well and were very aggressive
8017870 there are two kinds of music good music and the other kind
8017871 have you ever seen a nervous puma they pace back and forth restlessly and are constantly swishing and waving their tails to and fro wildly
8017872 the same things that make you laugh will make you cry
8017873 welcome back to the fight this time i know our side will win
8017874 it seems to be a little more of a problem than i anticipated
8017875 there is some risk involved all you need is 200 people in that crowd to boo and stuff like that and it will be replayed 900 times and thats not what you want out of this
8017876 os heavy handed tactics every time he squeezes much slips through his fingers
8017877 there has been constant mention all day in the media about hillary supporters and pumas they are almost obsessed with knowing what we will do
8017878 i have an objection to special status granted to the democratic party on ohio state ballots
8017879 cnn just interviewed a hil del who is trying to get signers to a petition to not have an acclamation but a full role call vote
8017880 i want them to know who i am and that i mean business
8017881 this is the first time in six months the dnc has stood up for
8017882 we will be looking for cues in what she says
8017883 you could tell how much our winner meant to the fans the roof came off when my goal went in
8017884 everyone knows that these are the games we have to win if we are going to mount a serious title challenge too many home points were squandered last season
8017885 maybe our fans were thinking of what happened last season when we drew too many games at home
8017886 but this time we have sent out a message that we can produce results like this

8017889 i have missed a lot of training and i am a couple of weeks behind the other lads when it comes to match fitness
8017890 the only way i am going to get that edge again is to get out on the pitch and play
8017891 i am not at my best at the moment but i hope the fans will be patient because i am only three weeks away from my best form and fitness

8017932 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8017933 i have gone back and forth on this because as a player youll always want to play youll never lose that urge to be out there but i could only do this if i could commit 100 percent physically mentally emotionally and i cant do that ive tried to convince myself and my body to give it one more year but in the end i just dont think i could turn it on like i need to again
8017934 i was listening to michelle obamas speech and she commented that senator biden hasnt forgotten where he came from maybe he and all those who support abortion have forgotten where we came from the womb
8017935 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8017936 the system we have in place will ensure that the proper call is made on home run balls and will not cause a significant delay to the game

8017951 be in this life as if you were a stranger or a traveler on a path
8017952 oh my people surely this worldly life is nothing but a quick passing enjoyment and certainly the hereafter thats the home that will last forever
8017953 this life has begun traveling away and the hereafter has begun traveling forward and each has its children so be one of the children of the hereafter and dont be one of the children of this life for today theres action with no account and tomorrow there will be account with no action
8017954 this life is not your permanent abode allaah has prescribed that it will come to an end and hes prescribed for its people to depart from it how often has a thriving population been ruined for something so insignificant and how often has a joyful resident been made to depart something so insignificant so prepare well may allaah have mercy on you for the journey with your best preparations and take provisions for the best provision is a conscience thats fearful of allaah
8017955 a believer in this life is worried and sad his worry is the objective of preparing himself and whoevers condition in this life is such then he has no concern other than taking provisions from what will benefit him during the return to his homeland he doesnt compete with the people of the land among whom hes merely a stranger in what they consider honorable and he doesnt become worried if he seems insignificant among them
8017956 my brother it appears to you as if youre a resident however youre really only constantly traveling and youre moving quickly death is heading towards you and this life is passing behind you whats passed of your life will not return to you to correct it on resurrection day
8017957 so then for sixty years youve been heading to your lord and youre about to reach him
8017958 do you know what that statement means youre saying i belong to allaah as a servant and im returning to him so whoever knows that he belongs to allaah as a servant and that hell return to him then he should know that hell be stopped and whoever knows that hes going to be stopped then he knows hell be questioned and whoever knows that hell be questioned then he should prepare an answer for that questioning
8017959 do good in what remains of your life then what has passed should be forgiven but if you do evil in what remains then you could be taken to account for what passed and for what remains
8017960 whoever spends all his days and nights riding on his animal then hell be taken to his destination even if he doesnt move
8017961 youre surrounded from every side know that you are moving forward with each day and night so beware of allaah and of standing between his hands and your final promise is with him peace

8017984 our fiscal 2008 performance was achieved in the context of the most challenging student financing environment in the companys history
8017985 during the fourth quarter we implemented several changes to offset the loss of sallie mae private loans for students with subprime credit profiles we established a new company sponsored student lending program access and thus far have arranged financing for the vast majority of students through title iv cash payments access and other resources
8017986 our disappointing earnings results for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 were primarily the result of lower than anticipated sales and the higher merchandise markdowns required to drive sales and lower the chicos brand inventory levels closer to current sales trends
8017987 the company expects same store sales to remain negative in the fall season but highlighted that it is pleased with initial reads on its fall offering
8017988 the current government mandate puts the company in a position of having to compete with foreign oil for feed for our livestock
8017989 this is a dynamic this industry has never faced we believe this policy is flawed and needs to be revised if food cost inflation is to be brought under control
8017990 given the rising prices and the companys strong presence in the stagnant u s economy business will continue to be rough for smithfield foods
8017991 the company is seeing growth overseas in emerging markets and that could help offset domestic weakness

8018395 if the president wants to lower gas prices he should stop hosting press conferences and start taking action
8018396 releasing oil from the strategic petroleum reserve and forcing oil companies to drill on the 68 million acres they already control would be a good place to start
8018397 make no mistake the price at the pump and sky high natural gas prices are the result of 27 years of failed washington policies the politics of fear implored by 14 consecutive congresses and three presidents at the behest of radical environmental groups like greenpeace sierra club and the center for biological diversity are the reasons americans are paying record prices for energy
8018398 i told them that i was committed to new york city opera and signed my contract
8018399 nobody knows at the moment what will happen anyway with their six week season plus rehearsals period the bayreuth festival should not affect my work for nyco on the contrary it could reinforce the international stature of city opera

8018409 bmo was quite a disappointment it was quite a bit lower than the targets
8018410 the news here is that lowered expectations should be thought of as the norm
8018411 scotia did better than bmo and thats part and parcel of the fact that they have very limited u s operations
8018412 there are challenging results out of the u s and i think the market rewards scotia for not playing in that pool
8018413 the other banks will have higher provisions for credit losses too but i think this is very specific to bmo because its fairway thats causing the problem here
8018414 people are really going to be watching whats happening on the domestic side
8018415 this marks a noticeable deceleration versus the strong 9 5 percent growth rate posted last quarter and supports our view that the flagship franchises of the canadian banks are in for a period of softer growth given the pressure on the top line

8018438 i think joe gets that point the most important question is can he be president i think most people believe he passes that test
8018439 joes got to be obamas point man but not his hit man that shouldnt be his role
8018440 one of the things i like about joe is hes a scrapper

8018444 police needed to reshuffle so that the officers who were on duty since yesterday tuesday can take a rest i still insist that as of now police will not use force to disperse protesters
8018445 this is the time that the authorities will storm into the government house

8018485 but to be honest western systems of punctuation were damned unsatisfactory for the next five hundred years until one man one fabulous venetian printer finally wrestled with the issue and pinned it to the mat that man was aldus manutius the elder 1450 1515 and i will happily admit i hadnt heard of him until about a year ago but am not absolutely kicking myself that i never volunteered to have his babies
8018486 if there is one lesson to be learned from this book it is that there is never a dull moment in the world of punctuation one minute the semicolon is gracefully joining sentences together in a flattering manner and the next it is calling a bunch of brawling commas to attention
8018487 in the family of punctuation where the period is daddy and the comma is mummy and the semicolon quietly practices the piano with crossed hands the exclamation mark is the big attention deficit brother who gets over excited and breaks things and laughs too loudly

8018490 researching the role of ball state in muncie during the middletown years would not be possible without the rich resources on administrative activity and student life available at the university archives combining that with the mapping capabilities of the geospatial resources and documents in the map collection i hope to make a significant contribution to the scholarship on muncie

8018494 t he medina message is not the fundamental universal eternal message of islam that founding message is from mecca so the reformation of islam must be based on a return to the mecca message in order to reconcile the mecca and medina messages into a single system muslim jurists have said that some of the medina verses have abrogated the corresponding earlier verses from mecca although the abrogation did take place and it was logical and valid jurisprudence at one time it was a postponement not a permanent abrogation
8018495 the mecca verses should now be made the basis of the law and the medina verses should be abrogated this counter abrogation will result in the total conciliation between islamic law and the modern development of human rights and civil liberties in this sense we reformers are superfundamentalists
8018496 in its origin the koran is a syro aramaic liturgical book with hymns and extracts from scriptures which might have been used in sacred christian services in the second place one may see in the koran the beginning of a preaching directed toward transmitting the belief in the sacred scriptures to the pagans of mecca in the arabic language its socio political sections which are not especially related to the original koran were added later in medina at its beginning the koran was not conceived as the foundation of a new religion it presupposes belief in the scriptures and thus functioned merely as an inroad into arabic society
8018497 reciprocity in the case of fornication is a fixed punishment hadd of either stoning to death or whipping
8018498 islam in its essence is not a religion according to the common meaning of the word but rather a science its dogma being merely transitional to its scientific stage
8018499 we have said that the quran was divided between al iman and al islam as well as being revealed in two parts as meccan and medinese the meccan quran was revealed first in other words people were invited to adopt islam in the ultimate sense first and when they failed to do so and it was practically demonstrated that they were below its standard they were addressed in accordance with their abilities
8018500 in this way all the verses of persuasion though they constitute the primary or original principle were abrogated or repealed by the verses of compulsion jihad this exception was necessitated by the circumstances of the time and the inadequacy of the human capability to discharge properly the duty of freedom at that time
8018501 some muslim scholars believe that islamic wars were purely defensive wars a mistaken belief prompted by their keenness to refute claims by the orientalists that islam spread by means of the sword in fact the sword was used to curtail the abuse of freedom islam used persuasion for thirteen years in propagating its clearly valid message for the individual and the community when the addressees failed to discharge properly the duties of their freedom they lost this freedom and the prophet was appointed as their guardian until they came of age however once they embraced the new religion and observed the sanctity of life and property and the social claims of their kith and kin as they had been instructed the sword was suspended and abuses of freedom were penalized according to new laws hence the development of islamic sharia law and the establishment of a new type of government in justifying the use of the sword we may describe it as a surgeons lancet and not a butchers knife when used with sufficient wisdom mercy and knowledge it uplifted the individual and purified society
8018502 suffering death by the sword in this life is really an aspect of suffering hell in the next life since both are punishments for disbelief whoever adds to his own disbelief by inciting others to disbelief or to shun the path of god must be suppressed before he takes up arms in the cause of disbelief
8018503 islams original principle is freedom but the islamic religion was revealed to a society in which slavery was an integral part of the socioeconomic order it was also a society that was shown in practice to be incapable of properly exercising its freedom and therefore its individual members needed guidance hence the consequent enactment of jihad in islamic jihad the muslims first had to offer to the unbelievers the new religion if they refused to accept it they had the second option of paying jizyah and living under muslim government while practicing their own religion and enjoying personal security if they also refused the option of jizyah the muslims would fight them and if victorious take some of them as slaves thereby adding to the number of those already in slavery
8018504 if an individual is invited to become the slave of god but refuses such refusal is symptomatic of ignorance that calls for a period of training
8018505 being so supreme islam has never been achieved by any nation up to the present day the nation of muslimin has not yet come it is expected to come however in the future of humanity
8018506 the key here is that no one should be allowed to own anything that permits the exploitation of one citizens labor to increase the income of another individual ownership even within such narrow boundaries should not be ownership of property as such but rather ownership of the benefits derived from property and all property remains in the ownership of god and the community as a whole as production from resources increases the equity of distribution is perfected and differences are reduced by raising both minimum and maximum incomes but the gap between minimum and maximum incomes is gradually narrowed in order to achieve absolute equality when such absolute equality is achieved through the grace of god and as a result of abundant production we shall achieve communism or a sharing of the earths wealth by all people communism thus differs from socialism in degree in the sense that socialism is a stage in the development towards communism the prophet experienced ultimate communism
8018507 as the prophet said justice shall fill the earth in the same way it was previously full of injustice this is what marx dreamed of but failed to find the way to achieve it can only be achieved by al muslimin who are yet to come and then the earth shall enjoy a degree of fulfillment of the verse the god fearing are in gardens and springs they will be told enter therein in peace and security we cleansed what was in their breasts of hatred so they became brothers sitting together never to feel hardship or be removed therefrom 15 45 48 this is the degree of communism to be achieved by islam with the coming of the nation of muslimin whence the earth shall light up with the light of its lord and gods grace is conferred upon its inhabitants when there shall be peace and love shall triumph
8018508 the texts in islam distinguish themselves from the texts of other religions by encouraging violence and aggression against people with other religious beliefs to a larger degree there are also straightforward calls for terror this has long been a taboo in the research into islam but it is a fact that we need to deal with
8018509 if it is correct that many muslims view the koran as the literal words of god which cannot be interpreted or rephrased then we have a problem it is indisputable that the texts encourage terror and violence consequently it must be reasonable to ask muslims themselves how they relate to the text if they read it as it is
8018510 all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god
8018511 throughout history rather than celebrating such biblical passages jews and christians have regarded them as a problem to be solved while interpretations of these passages differ widely among jews and christians from the beginning of rabbinic judaism and christianity one understanding has remained dominant among virtually all believers these passages are not commands for all generations to follow and if they have any applicability it is only in a spiritualized parabolic sense
8018512 the consensus view among jews and christians for many centuries is that unless you happen to be a hittite girgashite amorite canaanite perizzite hivite or jebusite these biblical passages simply do not apply to you the scriptures record gods commands to the israelites to make war against particular people only however this may be understood and however jarring it may be to modern sensibilities it does not amount to any kind of marching orders for believers thats one principal reason why jews and christians havent formed terror groups around the world that quote the bible to justify killing non combatants

8018514 we were asked to come up and give a general overview on the oilsands and canadas role in the world of energy in general which we did
8018515 they were exercising curiosity basically saying wow this is neat
8018516 i dont think it was particularly anybodys fault this language that had to be cleaned up was fairly simple and i was gone for quite a bit of time
8018517 he had some confidence that we would win some issues on appeal
8018518 they looked at more than 300 products including computer games toys virtual worlds for children and supposedly educational software to be run on home computers of these only two educational video games employed proven learning techniques
8018519 of the 300 products studied the survey yielded only two education video games based on explicit educational curriculum design available in the market
8018520 to catalyze and support research innovation and investment in digital media technologies to advance childrens learning
8018521 were certainly in the process of stabilising in terms of housing although i wouldnt want to say were there yet what we can say with some level of certainty is that the sharp declines in home sales are behind us and were flattening out
8018522 its very much a reflection of whats been going on in the energy markets
8018523 confidence remains quite low principally because of concerns about employment prospects
8018524 its clear that it will still take some time to work through the downturn in housing
8018525 once housing prices stabilise that will signal a return to a housing industry that can contribute to economic growth
8018526 thats a good question and it should be a simple one
8018527 obviously the war is a very important issue to me we need to get our troops home and we need to get them home now my own personal feelings about it is when the world is kind of perfect and we have those two things when were at peace and everybody has a good job although we should be working on these at the same time i dont mean to imply otherwise im really a big advocate for health care and of course my heart lies with education
8018528 i was kind of afraid of obama the first time i saw him
8018529 i think that not only can barack cause change because thats where his heart lies as a true american success story he understands how hard it is
8018530 he inspires us to be the best americans we can be and i think if hes president when hes president i should say were going to find people changing on the inside and once we all have hope for the future i think youre going to find everyones going to wake up and take control of this amazing moment where theres so many things that need help and people will all be inspired to help
8018531 i think the entertainment industry has all good intentions when we try to come out the thing that is unfortunate is that some of us who are maybe a little recognizable weve got to come out as private citizens and support our country in any way that we can
8018532 i have no qualms with a 7 500 square metre building with specified uses and i hope we can stipulate in the development agreement that the retail space will be curtailed
8018533 not only will it reduce the traffic in the downtown core but it will give us some redevelopment options down there as well
8018534 so far this year we have had a virtual parade of federal ministers coming here where the highlight of their visit appears to have been attending yet another conservative fundraising event
8018535 its time the yukon party government begin taking some of these issues to harper and his cabinet and not just participate in yet another photo op
8018536 think harpers going to be in dawson the day before
8018537 the harper government has focused its northern strategy on strengthening canadas military presence in the north rather than addressing fundamental social and economic needs

8018541 and today we are continuing on one lane but that is subject to stop at any minute depending on if the rain comes down any harder
8018542 thats a lot of rain a lot more than normal
8018543 it looks like weve set extreme daily rainfall records so that gives you an idea of how much precipitation has fallen
8018544 as soon as i know whats going on i post it on the service
8018545 but there wont be any construction or recovery of that road until weve got the klondike open
8018546 this was just a huge team effort between everybody that helped volunteers and sponsors and co ordinators it was great
8018547 the only thing that could have been better was a little bit better weather
8018548 i just like to mountain bike lots and its fun to go down the hill
8018549 its a good exercise and it just fun to have the wind on your face
8018550 my goal was to have fun and get a little bit competitive
8018551 i didnt have any goal i just went down and just to have a good time
8018552 i am happy with how it went and how i preformed and thats all you can do
8018553 it is challenging but it just adds another element of excitement to it
8018554 the rain adds just that extra edge you have to be just right on it to get down the course
8018555 its a great venue and i see great potential here if we could keep doing it

8018565 his essential point is this novels and short stories succeed or fail according to their capacity a capacity that has progressed over the centuries rather like the march of science to represent affectingly and credibly the actual workings of the human mind as it interacts with the real world
8018566 weve done a lot of research about buying habits as the internet has evolved and have been told repeatedly that requiring new buyers to register before they have a chance to really interact with ebay is a barrier to them taking the plunge this is the same reason we introduced my ebay for guests awhile back today many online buyers expect to be able to visit a site and simply purchase and pay for an item with minimum hassle introducing guest buying will help encourage more first purchases by new buyers
8018567 once they do theyll be able to use all the same features and programs our current buyers do such as feedback buyer protection access to customer support etc
8018568 when we signed geoff in the offseason we believed that we were acquiring a versatile player who can play many different positions and provide a solid bat in the lineup
8018569 geoff has made a significant contribution to our team in 2008 setting a career high in home runs and producing as both a starter and a pinch hitter
8018570 ive got a long way to go to redeem myself
8018571 im not going to sit on a good start and say things are better im proud of this start and im going to take the positives to my next start but im not totally redeemed
8018572 the key for us was to continue to give ourselves a chance with runners in scoring position
8018573 is john maine 100 percent right now no is he going to hurt himself probably not
8018574 does he want to pitch yes he wants to gut it out i am comfortable with anybody that wants to gut it out period but i do feel that if that is not enough for us to win then i have to make some decisions about that
8018575 it wont cause any serious structural damage but its a nagging thing thats going to be there the rest of the year
8018576 its a little bit easier when he gets runs early
8018577 it allows your pitcher to go out there and relax
8018578 when hes getting ahead of guys hes as good as anybody you want to put out there
8018579 i surprised myself because of giving up a slider for a home run
8018580 we got struggle time we got outstanding time just one day one game tomorrow were going to come back and win
8018581 the bullpen has pitched awfully well now we can use sampson along with hawkins in the late innings
8018582 terrific win team effort everybody contributed we played them all and they all contributed
8018583 all our extra men played and lots of them helped out
8018584 weve played good baseball we just havent got the offense on track in the last couple of days theyve done a good job against us
8018585 their pen shut us down and we kind of gave it up in our pen
8018586 its a tough deal because youd like to see him attack
8018587 theres also a plan in place and he didnt execute
8018588 whether its john maine or not i have a lot of confidence in our options whether its the kids or other guys well get the job done
8018589 well have to monitor that keep an eye on that
8018590 we just have to continue to do what weve done all year go to the kids if we have to the reality is the solution is not out there as far as a trade theres not going to be a guy who can make a difference
8018591 that being said i feel like the team is here weve got the guys who can get it done
8018592 i mean we hope that he does pitch but if he cant weve got good options weve got good kids in the minor leagues bobby parnell and jonathan niese we have brian stokes we have other guys weve used in the past nelson figueroa those guys
8018593 we hope maine can pitch but if he doesnt well make the adjustment
8018594 weve been making them all year thats one thing about this team it seems weve found the guys to get the job done
8018595 itll be some time this year whether its the middle of september well see
8018596 hes really got good stuff hes had success we keep waiting for that to happen again for him to find himself and have the confidence he once had hes just making bad pitches right now
8018597 theyre all trying to stay together and pull for each other and thats what we want them to do but as far as easy no its not easy
8018598 if you would have told me wed lead with five weeks left in the season and we had luis castillo pedro martinez those guys out for long periods of time i would have signed up
8018599 we had our opportunity we had a walk hit batter bunt single and the bases loaded with nobody out and two pitches later the innings over weve got to score there somehow
8018600 gagne got the bases loaded and out of it all on eight pitches
8018601 i am just struggling right now i made some pitches when i had to my mechanics are off and i just need to work on it friday and saturday in the bullpen
8018602 we got some big hits and made some big defensive plays tonight
8018603 i know that sounds a little weird with ben sheets throwing 94 95 mph my previous at bats he had gotten me out on some off speed pitches he just happened to leave it out over the plate and i was able to get a hold of it
8018604 he didnt have the good command like he normally does he battled them and kept it close and then geoff got the big hit for us
8018605 he pitched very good tonight but he made a couple of mistakes with two outs
8018606 it seemed like i didnt make many mistakes but the ones i did they hit hard
8018607 i aint pitching great but i dont think im pitching as bad as its made out to be ive pitched plenty of winnable games and ive pitched plenty of losable games in that stretch
8018608 in the first half i came away with a lot of victories pitching the same way that i am now
8018609 earlier i had a lot of room for error now when im pitching sometimes i think i get caught up in trying not to make a mistake because one can be the difference now
8018610 we had opportunities to score some runs early we scored one in the first and one in the second and had opportunities to score more but just couldnt get the big hit
8018611 its no more important than the four games we have in chicago after every game is the playoffs right now
8018612 he was patient he had short quick swings and stayed on the ball
8018613 you have to have that feeling of how to pitch
8018614 you draw it up and the law of averages says youre going to score some runs but you cant depend on that
8018615 hes throwing some filthy stuff up there right now i mean absolutely filthy

8018617 most people are not looking to get more than they pay for
8018618 but there is a group of people who will take and take with no respect for my time or my employees time
8018619 entrepreneurs have this horrifying sense of scarcity that the customers they have are the only ones in the world
8018620 that is the most damaging statement that has been made in business
8018621 but we needed to change how we interacted with them
8018622 going into therapy with your clients is a very unlikely scenario
8018623 she was very demeaning toward me and treated me like the hired help
8018624 if you are thinking about the client all the time you have to get out
8018625 all that time and energy i had spent on resolving conflict was now spent on getting new customers
8018626 that may help you uncover things so that you are better prepared
8018627 there is a manipulative component to that that may come back to haunt you
8018628 we have conversations with them to make sure our assumptions are correct and then we help them find the right partner
8018629 historic change at ebay semi persistent bin buy it now goes live

8018636 growing investor pressure is prompting more companies to see the value of making environmentally sound products
8018637 by re thinking their strategies with high energy prices and climate change in mind these companies will have a distinct competitive advantage in the years ahead
8018638 for always being so concerned about 12 or 14 or 19 point plans
8018639 due to the unprecedented demand for american eagle gold one ounce bullion coins our inventories have been depleted we are therefore temporarily suspending all sales of these coins
8018640 the results keep demonstrating that changing to circular hooks is the right choice since it favours turtle conservation without having an impact on the economy of artisanal fisheries
8018641 together with fishermen we are building a culture for sustainable fishing practices that will guarantee fish stocks in the long term
8018642 our goal is to reduce the incidental catch of marine turtles from the long line fishing operations without affecting the fisheries activity which is a main source of food and income for local communities
8018643 this programme is going beyond an initial focus of saving sea turtles from bycatch and is creating the groundwork toward sustainable artisanal long line fishing in the eastern pacific
8018644 by working co operatively collecting data and learning how to improve practices this programme is living proof that conservation and industry can work together for sustainability
8018645 the park will be the biggest offshore park in denmark and provide electricity for about 400 000 homes
8018646 requests for proposals for the construction of the offshore park will be announced as soon as possible
8018647 the product is safe to humans animals and the environment
8018648 people are becoming more aware of the negative effects of conventional pesticides at the same time growers are more willing to switch they have more choices and incentive compared to 10 years ago
8018649 i think there has been enough scientific evidence that theres a difference between lets say conventional tomatoes and organic tomatoes in terms of pesticide residues but also improved taste and higher levels of antioxidants
8018650 i think its a combination of the movement of green chemistry trying to protect the environment and peoples thoughts about their own health maybe not even their health but their kids and grandkids health
8018651 we get to poke fun at the creative process in theater
8018652 but anyone can find the humor in relating to any group of people thrown together and trying to make something work
8018653 the troupe continues to try to perform the play despite their knowledge that someone is killing cast members
8018654 anything can go wrong in the theater and everything that can go wrong does go wrong in this show
8018655 im trying to throw out the window all the training and experience that i have
8018656 he has to pretend and squat down because the chair is painted
8018657 antioxidants sit within this tiny trojan horse protecting it from attack from digestive juices in the stomach
8018658 once in the small intestine the nanoparticle gets sticky and bonds to the intestinal wall it then leaks its contents directly into the intestinal cells which allows them to be absorbed directly into the blood stream
8018659 we hope that by mastering this technique drugs and supplements also vulnerable to the digestive process can be better absorbed by the human body
8018660 for catechins the class of antioxidants under examination and among the most potent dietary antioxidants only between 0 1 and 1 1 per cent of the amount consumed makes it into our blood if we can improve that rate the benefits are enormous
8018661 the birds are living not dying but pcbs are affecting some part of their life cycle
8018662 if its possible we want to aim for the full commercialization of the system in the next three to five years
8018663 this is because small scale fisheries employ more than 12 million people world wide compared to half a million in the industrial sector
8018664 and because small scale fisheries use less fuel to catch fish
8018665 small scale fisheries use fishing gear that are more selective and far less destructive to deep sea environments
8018666 as a result they discard very little unwanted fish and almost all of their catch is used for human consumption
8018667 for the amount of resources invested we havent seen significant decrease in demand for species for which the global stocks are on the edge of collapse
8018668 market based initiatives while well intentioned unduly discriminate against small scale fishers for their lack of resources to provide data for certification
8018669 its an unfair disadvantage that in any other industry would have had people up in arms
8018670 but small scale fishers are often in developing countries and have very little political influence
8018671 without subsidies most large scale fishing operations will be economically unviable
8018672 small scale fishers will have a better chance of thriving in local markets and global fish stocks will have an opportunity to rebound
8018673 there is continued weakness in europe and asia and the concerns from yesterday are still here so i think the trend is lower
8018674 consumers are increasingly demanding quality and relief that what they are buying does not alter or cause harm to the environment
8018675 as a company we are in the process of obtaining an organic industrial license theres a long protocol to comply which should allow textiles working with organic wool to supply them with the necessary certification to a market willing to pay for the extra bonus
8018676 but not for the whole of the clip but a reasonable percentage
8018677 we know some farms are already moving towards the organic certification process so we estimate that not too long from now we should be able to supply the world uruguayan wool stamped with the organic seal
8018678 changes imposed to the tax reimbursement system which does not return the net transfer of what sheep farmers pay are having a negative effect on competitiveness and furthermore dent the social impact of sheep rearing
8018679 many times we hear speeches about how uruguay looks after new investors but they seem to forget a huge investment in land sheep technology textiles supported by 10 million sheep in which uruguayans have been investing for decades
8018680 its time to eliminate this levy which dates back to over half a century
8018681 the meager value of the us dollar the increase in taxes public utility rates and a lowering of the tax reimbursement system are increasingly punishing sheep farming and industry and this is particularly intense when all the production is exported and theres no domestic market to help absorb with an unprecedented appreciation of the peso the consequences of dollar inflation
8018682 but overseas clients wont pay for our inefficiencies be them productive monetary or financial
8018683 we must learn to live with other productions those which help the soil rest and recover and we should not be afraid of some kinds of grain agriculture
8018684 im not kidding you when we were with manhattan bagel it was literally just bagels
8018685 probably four years into it we realized that the location would do a lot better with a more expanded menu
8018686 we will be more than happy to assist you after you complete your cell phone calls
8018687 the world as it is getting real at high road
8018688 indirect land use change is not in the control of the producer how do you deal with that its a big big philosophical hole
8018689 certification standards could significantly enhance biofuels development or seriously retard it
8018690 the main concern is people try to deal with all problems land air environment child labor with a biofuels requirement and people are not going to do that
8018691 essentially you have a sea of plants monocultures for tens of kilometers in what sense can that ever be sustainable
8018692 i am extremely wary of well meaning people who like to feel good about themselves contributing in a terrible way to the destruction of our planet
8018693 the good news is that youre starting to see people all over the world starting to talk about these issues
8018694 they see it as a very typical developed country attempt to keep developing countries from profiting off a commodity
8018695 its been on their landscape for the past 15 years
8018696 shes considered to be one of the very good up and coming dancers in this tradition either in india or here
8018697 she is able to achieve a standard in india that is not very easy for a non native to achieve
8018698 its really quite an exquisite art form associated with the temples of south india theres a lot of emphasis on not only rhythms but also on gestures facial expression is extremely important
8018699 some of the themes are based on love between a man and a woman it can be love of a human being for the deity it can be love of a child
8018700 the first thing that is going to strike audiences is the costuming which is elaborate
8018701 i prefer to start them when theyre 8 because its a very complicated dance form it demands the whole body a lot of coordination
8018702 it tests the caliber of the dancer and the teacher
8018703 a state of the art mix of music dance theater and multimedia
8018704 people think that if they take a medication their body absorbs it and it disappears but of course thats not the case
8018705 it brings a question to peoples minds that if the fish were affected might there be a potential problem for humans
8018706 pharmaceuticals are only present in very low concentrations and therefore could not be dangerous
8018707 septic systems are essentially small treatment plants that are essentially unmanaged and therefore tend to fail
8018708 i think its a shame that so much money is going into monitoring to figure out if these things are out there and so little is being spent on human health
8018709 they need to just accept that these things are everywhere every chemical and pharmaceutical could be there its time for
8018710 these are chemicals that are designed to have very specific effects at very low concentrations
8018711 thats what pharmaceuticals do so when they get out to the environment it should not be a shock to people that they have effects
8018712 there are a lot of circumstances an artist has to face that are very similar to commerce
8018713 i guess its appropriating what is at hand materials that are readily available
8018714 while we were picking up carcasses i noticed that a large number didnt seem to have any external injuries
8018715 al final de la rambla me encontr con la negra flor
8018716 nomes nativos que at hoje em algumas localidades e conservat rias e not rios continuam a ser rejeitados em pro de nomes de matriz ocidental

8018718 we had between 3 000 and 4 000 people and that was with the upper arlington labor day arts festival and an osu football game going on
8018719 so we had a lot of competition and we still had people come
8018720 and then they can go hop on a real rolling train and hear the clicketyclack of the tracks
8018721 where there are permanent taliban settlements and where organized crime groups profit from the instability
8018722 more than half of afghanistan provinces are now poppy free
8018723 the gains in the north and east show that counternarcotics efforts can succeed
8018724 until they all face the full force of the law the opium economy will continue to prosper with impunity and the taliban will continue to profit from it
8018725 its all going to depend on where is the overall market and then specifically where is the c compact car segment of the market
8018726 in east liberty ohio honda is able to build the civic the cr v and the element
8018727 if ford can do three or four of what they call tophats that will be in concept comparable to what honda can do today
8018728 who is this chuck guy sending me an email i wonder if he is the guy in the orange smock that sold me the box of slug bait and toilet bowl wax ring and why does he have my email address
8018729 rss is getting a lot of traction and we see it as a great tool for people to gain immediacy when it comes to information
8018730 its got hidden curves it looks like it shouldnt be as hard as it is but its impossible
8018731 if you dont hit it the ball hard enough itll come back down
8018732 you never get a good kick off that back wall you always have to putt again and its a par 2
8018733 youve got to be talented like some of these 8 year olds
8018734 if you bank that correctly you can get a hole in one
8018735 i was doing a birthday party and all the kids all skipped that hole
8018736 i chose spanish because there are a lot of argentine players around the game and i want to be able to communicate with them
8018737 shes a tall gal 5 feet 8 inches and she has a long reach which really helps she will definitely be a factor in the match saturday
8018738 it was really the first time i have been hurt playing
8018739 if you love it enough you get right back on and keep playing
8018740 ive got to concentrate on my education and getting a good job
8018741 regrettably we have noticed the hand of our enemies to thwart us
8018742 food is the latest weapon in their regime change agenda
8018743 they cannot last a day longer if we as zimbabweans speak against them in deafening unison

8018748 the results of this test will help teachers know who is learning and who is not
8018749 right away teachers began preparing students to do their very best in school and on the test
8018750 so you will not want to eat your test later
8018751 share your score report with those who love and care about you
8018752 as a matter of fact the lie is obviously entirely parasitic upon the truth whereas truth is independent and autonomous and is by no means dependent upon the lie it stands alone and endures even if not a single human being believes it but a lie can only exist if someone knows the truth therefore a liar is someone who knows truth but places other things above it

8018758 we like to engage in philosophical explorations because we enjoy it its healthy and inspiring its not about competition or one up manship it is about intellectual exploration where ever this might lead us

8018763 its not the size of the dog in the fight its the size of the fight in the dog
8018764 u s small companies are a contrarian place to be right now
8018765 most people are still stuck on that large company bandwagon but quietly small companies are outperforming
8018766 we liked the strategy but we didnt think the timing was right in terms of where they were in the cycle
8018767 be free then freely criticize then freely evaluate the criticism then be free
8018768 philosophical discussion figuratively moved into the courtroom with the philosopher as litigator
8018769 the fund shareholder gets a much more stable ride because of the lending of different approaches

8018772 if youre a younger person with a much longer time horizon with much greater risk tolerance markets like this give you an excellent opportunity to put more money to work
8018773 establish what your needs are what your goals are what your plans are and the professionals will sit down and put together a program with an acceptable level of risk tolerance
8018774 you need to be well armed with an array of plans for all situations
8018775 you need to spend time educating yourself so that youre prepared for all different types of markets
8018776 people hold on to losers because they dont want to admit theyre wrong they think things are going to get better
8018777 when you go into a trade you have to have some idea of when you get out of a trade
8018778 at the moment you enter a trade you should set that exit plan up
8018779 if you find yourself rooting for or cheering for your stock as if its a sports team you have to step back
8018780 its very hard at that moment to start applying these principles
8018781 the project aims to harvest 14 million cubic meters 494 4 million cu ft of timber worth about 4 billion
8018782 there are very similar circumstances in numerous countries around the world including ivory coast cameroon brazil surinam malaysia and others
8018783 the potential is there they are awaiting to see the outcome of the ghana project
8018784 5 million hectares 12 36 million acres of salvageable submerged timber in the hydroelectric reservoirs in the tropics with the potential to supplement global demand for timber
8018785 boat collisions with submerged tree stumps cause many fatalities every year
8018786 maybe at the time we thought we had enough timber in our forest estates to sustain us now because of the decline we need to diversify
8018787 i got a new mentor barack obamas my mentor yall believe that man for the first time we ready for change homie we gon back it any you people out there listening its a hands off policy on barack obama man yall touch him we touchin everything thats my word to god thats on the hood every hood im telling you right now yall touch him you know what it is and for the first time in life period i dont know if you know about black men but black men are sincere they mean what they say especially when they have power and he has power man he means what he i think this the change this the change we need everybody the whole world we need somebody thats just for us and thats our country man barack obama hats off to you homie im not on no nothing else congratulations win lose or draw we with you boy

8018789 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8018790 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8018791 its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize
8018792 we knew it was a long shot but we owed it to ourselves to exhaust the possibility
8018793 we appreciate michael even considering ending his retirement he has a new career in front of him and we wish him nothing but the best as we all said when he announced his retirement michael was and is a great giant
8018794 there is a reason he went in the first round obviously
8018795 the guy he is playing behind strahan and osi and then we moved him to linebacker so obviously he is one of our top players on the team and he is going to show that he is a top defensive end in the league
8018796 we know we are a confident team and we are a playoff capable team and we have to go out and perform like it
8018797 the reason we took the underdog role last year was because everybody said it and we just went with it were not thinking like that this year we do have a chip on our shoulders and it grows more and more when somebody gives us something to feed off of
8018798 the only reason he will come back is if he wants to play
8018799 for many developing countries avoiding deforestation is pretty much the only way they can engage in the climate change regime and reap some benefits
8018800 we think this is particularly relevant to africa we want this next climate regime to benefit africa
8018801 we shall perhaps see a new dawn for tropical forests
8018802 a levy of that level is about 0 6 percent of an airfare price
8018803 this is about rural communities and indigenous peoples this is about business we have got to bring communities and the private sector together
8018804 all the wise men round the world dont know the answers
8018805 smiling into oblivion then dreaming swift into the heart of the abyss
8018806 we must confront the underlying causes of the aids plague poverty inequalities of race gender and class sexual stigmas and a politics that allows us to deny our responsibilities to and for each other
8018807 sex education is the name of the game abstinence only shame shame shame
8018808 we never expected these results people should get what they pay for
8018809 isnt it easier to have them disappear onto the bus each day
8018810 its like you know having dinner with three people for seven years and getting quite bored of each other
8018811 so its having a fourth person new opinion i think its gonna be interesting
8018812 kara has a good reputation of a having hits and b having an opinion and thats a good combination
8018813 concerned about the audience and acceptance time will tell well see
8018814 i know kara and she speaks her mind so she will be speaking her mind
8018815 you really can tell that your boys are smart i mean just listening to their conversation and the things that they ask they must get a lot from homeschooling
8018816 i dont how they are doing social wise i mean do they get time to be with other kids
8018817 now we have nancy pelosi bloviating and i say that in an affectionate way behind us
8018818 it doesnt seem like the crowd is on the edge of their seats
8018819 how can you cover a convention when youre talking while the main speakers are speaking
8018820 were going to see the democrats in action what they say what they look like
8018821 not just obama and clinton but all of the other ones too
8018822 but i cant help but feel after the first night of the convention that it was largely a wasted night
8018823 they are trying to race across the viability threshold before the republicans can say that this man is not ready to be president
8018824 we have to prepare for the world coming to the arctic
8018825 improving water productivity and reducing the quantity of food wasted can enable us to provide a better diet for the poor and enough food for growing populations
8018826 thats like leaving the tap running and pouring 40 trillion litres of water into the garbage can enough water to meet the household needs of 500 million people
8018827 i was very surprised with the high numbers but it catches everybodys attention
8018828 so there is a distribution problem but this also reflects the maldistribution of water
8018829 curbing these losses and improving water productivity provides win win opportunities for farmers business ecosystems and the global hungry
8018830 uk water footprint the impact of the uks food and fibre consumption on global water resources
8018831 only 38 percent of uks total water use comes from its own rivers lakes and groundwater reserves
8018832 therefore it is essential that business and government identify the areas that could potentially suffer water crises and develop solutions so the environment is not over exploited to the point that people and wildlife lose out
8018833 i dont seek the presidency on the presumption im blessed with such personal greatness that history has anointed me to save my country in its hour of need i seek the office with the humility of a man who cannot forget my country saved me
8018834 there are those who speak about you who say he lost an arm he lost a leg she lost her sight i object you gave your arm you gave your leg you gave your sight as gifts to your nation that we might live in freedom thank you and to your families families of the fallen and families of the wounded you sacrificed in ways that those of us who have not walked in your shoes can only imagine

8018841 conflict of interest could arise when an employer with a self funded benefit plan e g a self insured health plan also acts as the claims administrator for the plan
8018842 the supreme court held that such potential conflicts of interest could in certain circumstances result in less judicial deference to a claims administrators interpretation of a benefit claim if that claim is ever litigated

8018895 okay she may be hot but shes kind of bitchy stupid callous pick your redeeming flaw so i dont have to hate her
8018896 i liked the storyline but i dont think you captured the characters very well for instance its almost as if ren has become more of a comedial character when we all know that to not be true except within some contexts he has a much darker atmosphere about him and witty dialogue that i dont particularly see portrayed here as for kyokou she seems so timid i had a really hard time picturing her the way you described its true she does show some hint of sensitivity later on but this is almost dragged out into something more exaggerated however other than that i would say this is the best skip beat fic so far im looking forward to reading more

8018915 the gist of the original sharks fin article is that it is hypocritical of those in the west to tell one what to eat or not to eat based on their own cultural bias and not the facts sharks killed primarily because of sharks fin soup consumption is only a small percentage of the total sharks killed furthermore according to cites only 3 species of sharks are endangered the other 300 odd species can be freely traded which means its ok to consume sharks fin soup just like eating your ikan kembung or bawal hitam
8018916 i read this and am amazed it seems we are pointless running around without addressing the real issue whether the fact is right or wrong or watever the main issue is protecting the sharks for ecological balance and future generation whether we kill one shark or another country kills thousands of sharks is immaterial

8019226 dat is geregeld zullen we nog even iets gaan drinken bij de tamboer
8019227 waarom niet hier zitten we ons alleen maar te vervelen bovendien komt mijn moeder morgen weer thuis van haar zakenreis en dan is het weer over met de vrijheid

8019241 maar ik heb helemaal niets met dat ophangen te maken gehad
8019242 we hebben hier met een niet logisch denkend wezen te maken fergus wil wraak en jij was op de verkeerde tijd op de verkeerde plaats
8019243 we moeten snel ingrijpen maar daar heb ik jou bij nodig samen gaan we naar de kelder en dan gaan we deze geest te lijf jij hoeft alleen mijn handen vast te houden en je te concentreren ik wil dat je in gedachten de ruimte vult met helder wit licht en daarmee alles verdrijft wat zwart en slecht is
8019244 kom hierheen marloes we moeten hem samen te lijf gaan

8019380 several direct mail pieces issued for obamas primary senate campaign said he was a law professor at the university of chicago he is not he is a senior lecturer now on leave at the school
8019381 but its not something that we had anything to do with or were aware of and that frankly given what it looks like we dont have the technical capacity to create something like that
8019382 i made the ad on a sunday afternoon in my apartment using my personal equipment a mac and some software uploaded it to youtube and sent links around to blogs
8019383 according to the obama campaign obamas punahou classmate keith kakugawa explicitly raised the possibility that he could make up false stories about obama implying he would do so if the campaign did not give him money
8019384 sen barack obama continued accepting donations from oil company executives and employees last month even as he aired ads in which he stated he took no oil company money his campaign finance reports show obama has taken at least 263 000 from oil company executives family members and employees since entering the presidential race last year including 46 000 last month at least 140 000 has come in chunks of between 1 000 and 2 300 the maximum permitted under federal law
8019385 considering that sen obama voted to suspend the gas tax three times when gas cost less than 2 a gallon and has an energy lobbyist chairing his indiana campaign its hard to take his latest criticisms very seriously senator obama wants americans to pay the gas tax but senator clinton thinks the big oil companies should pay it this summer
8019386 im not running away from the fact that im a lobbyist i have a healthy client list and im proud of it
8019387 when it comes to lobbyists senator obamas words might sound nice but voters need to make sure they read the fine print despite trying to give the impression that he has no relationship with lobbyists or special interests the reality is that senator obama takes money from people who hire lobbyists partners of lobbyists spouses of lobbyists former lobbyists and state lobbyists
8019388 but those who lobby for a living say its not that simple and even obamas stance shows some flexibility he wont take money from federal lobbyists but accepts money from employees of firms and corporations that lobby and he uses lobbyists and other government relations professionals as advisers obama has also used major fundraisers who are registered lobbyists on the state level and he uses registered federal lobbyists such as broderick johnson who lobbies for at amp t and shell oil among others as a campaign adviser because johnson isnt giving money to obama his name wont show up in federal election commission records
8019389 while obama doesnt accept money from registered federal lobbyists five of his 10 biggest sources of funds are groups of employees at law firms that lobby in washington among obamas top donors were employees of the chicago based law firm of sidley austin llp who gave 105 750 in the first quarter the firm was paid 4 5 million last year
8019390 but behind obamas campaign rhetoric about taking on special interests lies a more complicated truth a globe review of obamas campaign finance records shows that he collected hundreds of thousands of dollars from lobbyists and pacs as a state legislator in illinois a us senator and a presidential aspirant in obamas eight years in the illinois senate from 1996 to 2004 almost two thirds of the money he raised for his campaigns 296 000 of 461 000 came from pacs corporate contributions or unions according to illinois board of elections records he tapped financial services firms real estate developers healthcare providers oil companies and many other corporate interests the records show
8019391 the war is against those who regard the bible to be gods revelation to humanity and the ten commandments to be his set of rules for all time phase one in this war is to make christianity well sort of socially unacceptable something only foolish poor and ugly people could turn to
8019392 tyranny comes when citizens are seduced into trading freedom for the promise of safety and security
8019393 without a vibrant and vital christianity america is doomed and without america the west is doomed

8019512 if you have a problem with that just build a bridge and get over it
8019513 the truth of the matter is if the non motivated sellers would take their properties off the market it would do more to motivate the market than anything else
8019514 ok so if margaret is six then brendan is four no wait brendan just had a birthday but that would make m seven how old is joe again

8019517 a lady walked into our hall at the same time one of our small group was meeting for prayer in the prayer room
8019518 she came in with a broken heart and met jesus
8019519 in august i was hanging out with a friend when she told me she had to leave for her
8019520 last time we prayed the presence of god was so intense that i almost couldnt keep away from the prayer room
8019521 we are into day 2 and the presence of god is so strong already
8019522 we had a baptism service planned for tonight with 6 people being baptised their testimonies were incredible at the end our pastor the new associate pastor we appointed in the 24 7 prayer room last year did something we have never done before he invited anyone else who would like to be baptised to come forward we ended up with another 4 baptisms 10 in total what a way to round off an incredible week of 24 7 prayer
8019523 i have seen the lord again in this quiet place yet i dare not look on his face i feel his arms and love surround me and wonder again at his perfect grace
8019524 a guy from southern finland approximately 500 km away had found our prayer room details from the internet he was really exited about the 24 7 movement as he was reading red moon rising and decided it was worth his while to travel all the way to oulu just to spend a few hours in the room as you know god has a perfect timing this chap arrived at the prayer room to cover for one hour where the pray er had not turned up talk about coincidence
8019525 i just wanted to let you know what an inspiration 24 7 has been and st james church singapore are raring to start praying non stop for the first time this sunday
8019526 i have a hard time putting into words the emotions that overcame me at that moment we entered the prayer room at that point i didnt believe in jesus or god or much of anything but i was rocked to the point of no longer being able to stand on my own two feet i simply had to sit down i was overcome with emotions i sat there shaking with tears that i desperately tried to hide i felt something but could not until now put it into words i felt god i simply felt his presence and was shocked i was here on business not for god i thought i had given up on god
8019527 eino is 56 and has had problems with his back he had to take strong painkillers and found moving around even walking really hard before our 24 7 he had an appointment scheduled for surgery in the 24 7 prayer room he was prayed for and god healed him
8019528 i can now say that the 24 7 prayer room is a part of our church we have people of all ages coming to our prayer rooms from only a few months old our teenagers and youth to people in their 70s and more
8019529 after one of the last prayer times we had a time of evangelism and a couple in their 80s became christians he is blind theyre totally illiterate and very poor they immediately volunteered to pray but we werent sure theyd know what to do so i kept checking up on them every time we went to see we could hear them praying loudly for the whole hour
8019530 what we saw of the drawings on the wall and the writings on the share book the words most frequently used words were love and father some people wrote about how they had forgotten how good it is to just stay still in his presence alone with him no distractions no nothing even if it were for just that one person to come closer to god again it was already worthwhile
8019531 the prayer week is going great the church building is unrecognisable and so is the atmosphere
8019532 the presence and glory has increased every week we are experiencing an opening of the heavens over armavir that even people who dont come to the prayer room are noticing
8019533 we found out there was a new age fair in oulu the same weekend as our 24 2 when one of my friends called the exhibition organiser she said that someone had just cancelled a fair stand in a central location from the testimonies i heard god has really been doing some great stuff people got saved and lots of new testaments were given out there was also a worship dance group performing on stage for next year the organisers were enquiring whether there could be some christian lecturing about marriage love and relationships this would be alongside the lecture on astrology
8019534 god is such an amazing god im so glad that i came to the 24 7 prayer room last year every prayer i prayed except one came to be i couldnt be happier
8019535 the week is going ok in fact really ok many of our youths have been saved and i know that god is working every day night every hour so more people can meet him
8019536 the prayer room has just started and there are already so many things to say and my english just isnt good enough to put them into words the presence of god was absolutely magnificent so powerful yet so sweet prayers were answered small things to our human minds but incredibly powerful when we think of the transformation in peoples lives
8019537 to god your mighty powerful god you are wonderful i love you so so so much you are the best in the whole wide world
8019538 our 24 7 went really well we had a lot of youth signing up this time and some of them went for two hour slots and enjoyed jesus in a new way
8019539 i received a call from my sister who was due to give birth a month later she was on her way to the hospital after leaving her doctors appointment her baby was very sick and they were inducing labor immediately a friend called her church and put my sister and the baby on a prayer list my grandmother did the same and so did many others my sister delivered a healthy beautiful baby girl to the amazement of all the doctors working on her case while my family continued to talk of the ignorance of all things medical i once again was rocked to my very soul i knew that i had just witnessed a miracle beyond the one of life i knew that my niece was healed through the power of prayer and i was instantly and to my own shock a believer in jesus christ
8019540 we had a couple of teenage lads who we know from our community youth club come in and do our walk through easter when it came to writing names of people they wanted to see become christians they put themselves down they also added prayers for their family and for god to have more to do in our area really shocked and surprised me as these lads are often 2 of our worst behaved and least likely to talk about god this seems to maybe be a catalyst for them
8019541 its amazing how close god is in my prayer he answered my prayer before i began thank you god
8019542 the thing thats really been encouraging for me is kids today they love jesus but theyre really under whelmed by the church its been amazing to watch them come alive with 24 7
8019543 on sunday morning an aboriginal lady with 3 children turned up after the morning service wanting to meet with god they returned in the evening to our first sunday night prayer service and she shared with the group that she dreamed of a light that led her to our church god is doing awesome things in this place
8019544 hollywood hills and suburban thrills and you who are you kidding im not like them
8019545 thank you for the enormous sweater aunt liz how big did you think i was
8019546 nice to meet you but please excuse my red eyes mummy is a bit rubbish with the camera
8019547 where there are no oxen the manger is empty but from the strength of an ox comes an abundant harvest
8019548 now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen
8019549 thats ok ever since i lost my teeth all ive been able to do is lick the chocolate off of them
8019550 i think i got the first tech because i reached in after jackson fouled terry and the second one he told coach that he gave me a warning and coach told me to calm down and i was calm i thought we kept our emotions in check for the most part but the refs saw otherwise

8019554 organizations whose primary mission focuses upon health and human service issues
8019555 after careful review it has been decided that the primary mission of charity is not health and human services
8019556 i must say that after our initial get together it was so exhilarating and fun that i did feel i would like to do more
8019557 i guess the door has been left slightly ajar well have to see how we feel about it afterwards everybodys got to really want to do it
8019558 annie do you want to do this the hard way or the easy way
8019559 de fans zullen het verschil merken ze zullen verrast zijn
8019560 doorgaans als je een u2 song draai loopt de dansvloer leeg dat zou nu wel eens anders kunnen worden er zijn trance invloeden maar er komt ook nogal wat hardcore metal gitaarspel uit the edge
8019561 and without faith it is impossible to please god because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him
8019562 i tell you the truth if anyone says to this mountain go throw yourself into the sea and does not doubt in his heart but believes that what he says will happen it will be done for him
8019563 every time i eat in a restaurant the server always screws up my order
8019564 is what im about to say going to express my faith in god or my fear of what might go wrong
8019565 ive lived here for nearly 12 years im a permanent resident am i not asian

8019571 i knew that mary knows her stuff but she just couldnt answer all of this guys questions when she asked me for our head engineers e mail address all the red flags went up and alarm bells were ringing furiously
8019572 but when i started asking him questions where was the plant what type of capacity where they looking for and why he needed that level of detailed information from us he suddenly lost interest in the conversation
8019573 until later when i was walking the show floor i walked by our largest competitor and guess who was working the booth youll never believe it our nosy attendee
8019574 its getting to be a little bit of a problem with the material were writing
8019575 because the singer we use will obviously have some bearing on what kind of songs we write but we know that we want to make a proper follow up to

8019581 ten years ago when political darkness still lay dense upon every state in the union this book was dedicated to the greatest benefactor we people have known since lincoln today he is a benefactor even greater than he was then his voice instead of being almost solitary has inspired many followers the lost habit of sincerity gives promise of returning to the minds and lips of public men after night half a century of shirking and evasion americans are beginning to look at themselves and their institutions straight to perceive that selling your vote or casting it for unknown nobodies are not enough attention to pay to the republic if this book be anything more than an american story it is an expression of american faith
8019582 there is nothing cute or charming about chess it is a violent sport and when you confront your opponent you set out to crush his ego chess is a battleground on which the enemy has to be vanquished
8019583 im a yankee from chicago il transplanted to birmingham via jesus and my husband he keeps me here come hither to read all about me my life my thoughts

8019586 you cannot control what happens to you but you can control your attitude toward what happens to you and in that you will be mastering change rather than allowing it to master you
8019587 the weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world on the contrary they have divine power to demolish strongholds we demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of god and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to christ
8019588 do the thing you fear most and the death of fear is certain
8019589 success is the progressive realization of a worthy goal or ideal
8019590 i wont quit until i have achieved my goal i know that i will fail but i am determined to learn from my mistakes adjust my actions and continue on in faith that i must eventually succeed
8019591 thats ok ever since i lost my teeth all ive been able to do is lick the chocolate off of them
8019592 did you know that your inspection and registration have both expired
8019593 see that any time you feel pained or defeated it is only because you insist on clinging to what doesnt work dare to let go and you wont lose a thing except for a punishing idea
8019594 i pray also that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which he has called you the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints and his incomparably great power for us who believe that power is like the working of his mighty strength which he exerted in christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly realms far above all rule and authority power and dominion and every title that can be given not only in the present age but also in the one to come and god placed all things under his feet and appointed him to be head over everything for the church which is his body the fullness of him who fills everything in every way
8019595 so i say to you ask and it will be given to you seek and you will find knock and the door will be opened to you for everyone who asks receives he who seeks finds and to him who knocks the door will be opened
8019596 do not let this book of the law depart from your mouth meditate on it day and night so that you may be careful to do everything written in it then you will be prosperous and successful
8019597 have you realized that most of your unhappiness in life is due to the fact that you are listening to yourself instead of talking to yourself
8019598 you may ask me for anything in my name and i will do it
8019599 in the past i may have felt like god didnt hear me but i now choose to believe what he said in his word i choose to believe the truth that as long as i desire to remain in him and to let his word remain in me i can ask for whatever i wish and it will be given to me john 15 7
8019600 i realized that i wasnt wearing a mask and id be easily recognized if the crime was reported to the police
8019601 why cant we just turn back time to before this ever happened
8019602 organisations are no longer built on force but on trust the existence of trust between people does not necessarily mean that they like one another it means that they understand one another
8019603 taking responsibility for relationships is therefore an absolute necessity it is a duty whether one is a member of the organisation a consultant to it a supplier or a distributor one owes that responsibility to all ones coworkers those whose work one depends on as well as those who depend on ones own work
8019604 trust us we understand who you are and what you want and stand for
8019605 trust us with the safety of your families and community
8019606 zie je wel het is toch een vieze oude man
8019607 grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of christ
8019608 as you do not know what is the way of the wind or how the bones grow in the womb of her who is with child so you do not know the works of god who makes everything
8019609 the kingdom of god is as if a man should scatter seed on the ground and should sleep by night and rise by day and the seed should sprout and grow he himself does not know how for the earth yields crops by itself first the blade then the head after that the full grain in the head but when the grain ripens immediately he puts in the sickle because the harvest has come
8019610 there are two parts to influence first influence is powerful and second influence is subtle you wouldnt let someone push you off course but you might let someone nudge you off course and not even realize it
8019611 therefore i tell you whatever you ask for in prayer believe that you have received it and it will be yours
8019612 well of course i can imagine what it would be like it would be like
8019613 before they call i will answer while they are still speaking i will hear
8019614 faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see
8019615 consider it pure joy my brothers whenever you face trials of many kinds because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance perseverance must finish its work so that you may be mature and complete not lacking anything

8019626 as a student intern at hesperian i have the incredible and often emotionally overwhelming pleasure of reading the amazing thank you letters and stories we receive from all over the world as part of our program gives free hesperian books by request to impoverished communities around the world that could not afford them otherwise photo gratis recipients of hesperians a book for midwives adapted their own edition for inuit communities ive read through hundreds of letters describing poor roads in ghana political instability and turmoil in sierra leone lack of education in nepal and lack of resources in latin america addressing these glaring disparities between access to necessary services and infrastructure in the global north and the global south is a part of the founding philosophy behind hesperian reading the glowing words and loving concern with which gratis recipients describe their deep dedication to their families and communities has made me question why i dont regularly express my love and appreciation for my friends family and community in such overt and profound ways i was moved by the young woman in ethiopia who was determined to put herself through college to be a teacher in order to pay for her younger brother to go to school and by the deep sorrow of the community health worker in uganda when his grandfather died whom he described as his best friend a young man in west africa writing a thank you letter on behalf of himself and his family wrote that he had once heard that unexpressed gratitude will eventually poison the soul i thought this was an interesting saying and didnt understand it at first however the more i thought about it the more i began to understand and truly take the expression to heart i looked at it from the larger picture of going through life without ever truly appreciating things and sharing that gratitude i realized that i just dont acknowledge the worth of some things in my life and while i appreciate other things i dont consciously express my gratitude reading these letters has truly been an eye and heart opening experience i have been overwhelmed by the profusion of blessings and unreserved thanks by gratis recipients their graciousness and emotional honesty has been contagious and i plan on carrying and sharing this gratitude not only through this holiday season but the years

8019630 and if christ has not been raised your faith is futile you are still in your sins
8019631 if your body is dead because of sin your spirit is alive because of righteousness and if the spirit who raised jesus from the dead is living in you he who raised christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his spirit who lives in you
8019632 walking in newness of life with confidence because already the spirit who is our foretaste and down payment of final redemption see 8 23 makes us alive so that we please god here and now by living a spirit filled and spirit directed life
8019633 handelt es sich um eine anthologieserie die bis zu ihrem tod von
8019634 we made the hop skip and the jump but not the leap
8019635 let me take a quick look around and then we can plan our route
8019636 we should get to the town by mid to late yellow
8019637 that means that we arrive at the batland by late green or early blue we should get to the bio matloc during violet hopefully we can take care of any competition before the mark turns white
8019638 maybe youd like to come out into the sunlight and carry me for a change
8019639 its the bursting into flames that i might have a problem with
8019640 im going to stop and take a break in the middle of town
8019641 that should give you enough shade to come out of the backpack for a while
8019642 are there any cool towns with cool people back that way
8019643 she and her spec unit arent here to be our friends
8019644 i used to have me a dog fer protection but he ate a rad rabbit and the rads kilt him oh well
8019645 so that tracy trying to sneak up behind me isnt with you
8019646 looks like we get to do this the hard way
8019647 but i can keep you busy long enough for zeta to touch you it wont be long after that before you get a bad case of the rot
8019648 youve taken enough damage to break your links to your phoenix and dark your marks
8019649 they dont want to be around when theres a doos on the loose
8019650 i cant tell exactly whats in there and we dont want to get close enough to find out
8019651 you might want to turn that crackler down until it only warns us of danger rads
8019652 the rads make it hard enough for me to see from in here i dont need that noise driving me crazy
8019653 besides if there is anything alive in here we dont want to call em to us
8019654 i dont have to be a mind reader to tell that youre getting a fever too
8019655 they will knock me out for at least a color
8019656 besides if you dont get that fever under control quick it could kill you
8019657 look around the side of the shed and see for yourself
8019658 hey maybe you can throw one of those boomerangs and get the searius to go fetch
8019659 its good to see that youre so concerned about my future health

8019661 a reasonable examiner would certainly want to consider test data that is directly related to an important issue of patentability along with the applicants interpretation of that data whether the examiner would have ultimately allowed the patent to issue is irrelevant
8019662 a n applicant should know information is material when the examiner repeatedly raises an issue to which the information relates
8019663 the district court did not rely solely on the applicants motive in drawing an inference of intent
8019664 e ven if there were a mitigating explanation for the withheld data it was no excuse for the applicants purposeful omission in this case
8019665 that subjective good faith can support a defense to inequitable conduct
8019666 w hen an applicant knows or obviously should know that information would be material to the examiner as was true here but the applicant decides to withhold that information good faith does not negate an intent to manipulate the evidence
8019667 letter explicitly sets forth an amount of oil to be delivered at a specified unit price and under a standard contract designation fob free on board which allocates the risks and responsibilities of a buyer and a seller
8019668 expressing a desire to do business in the future does not negate the commercial character of the transaction then under discussion

8019677 news is what somebody somewhere wants to suppress all the rest is advertising
