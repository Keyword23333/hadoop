8090115 queremos abordar todas as plataformas digitais n o apenas como m dia mas principalmente como parte fundamental da estrat gia de neg cios das empresas
8090116 yesterday there was nothing then this morning it suddenly appeared like this
8090117 olympics this and olympics that in the end would it allow people to live or not
8090118 why cant i send it i am just sending a small present
8090119 i originally thought that the olympics would bring us common people some good luck but i never expected it would be like this if the situation continues it will be impossible for us to do anything it seems that during the olympics i can only stay home and watch the olympics
8090120 now it is the special period of the olympics you must be very cautious and should not go out as you please in the event that any incidents happen then the patrolling group will exaggeratedly label you as somebody who attempts to sabotage the stability of the society during the olympics then you will bite off more than you can chew
8090121 we heard that the monks in the monasteries are very strong and they are very good at fighting is that so
8090122 we are providing assistance to those outsiders who are employed to fight the war and their objects of war are monks we respect the most and our compatriots what are we doing
8090123 do not do this why bother to do these things it must hurt a lot the three jewels bless these poor children
8090124 the government has taken great pains in preparing for it for a long time and they must want the olympics to go smoothly what are those people who sabotage it doing the government is trying so hard they should help the government to achieve their goal if they want to stir up trouble they can do so later the government is rather pitiful
8090125 we should think how long ago the earthquake just ended they must be without any conscience otherwise how can they make those exaggerated and arrogant actions these chengdu people are indeed exaggerated and doing things without taking the situation into consideration
8090126 we are all descendants of yan di and huang di and we are all children of the chinese nation
8090127 the planes pilot has indicated that the pirates who number 10 or maybe more have said they belong to the sudanese liberation army of abdel wahid mohammed nur
8090128 police have surrounded government house they are not going to disperse the crowd we are trying to negotiate
8090129 police will seek the warrants for our arrest today dont panic if we have been arrested others will carry on
8090130 the pads highly provocative action yesterday was completely uncalled for
8090131 they the pad want bloodshed in the country they want the military to come out and stage a coup again
8090132 i will not resign i will stay to protect this country
8090133 this is not an easy choice but it is the only way to save the lives of people
8090134 examine from this point of view the consequences of russias decision
8090135 looking at a variety of options with regard to consequences for russias behaviour in georgia its aggression in georgia
8090136 if they want relations to worsen they will get it
8090137 russia to live up to its international commitments reconsider this irresponsible decision and follow the approach set out in the six point agreement
8090138 the united states and some european capitals are promising saakashvili defence by nato calling for the re arming of the tbilisi regime and already starting new arms deliveries to him
8090139 break the georgian state undermine the fundamental values of georgia and to wipe georgia fron the map
8090140 international relations you cannot have one rule for some and another rule for others
8090141 i dont think we should really be afraid of isolation
8090142 well the other big political story if you believe there are two americas then john edwards is in trouble in both of them do you know about this the mainstream media is now starting to report a story that was first broken by the national enquirer that john edwards was caught leaving his girlfriends hotel room at the beverly hilton hotel at 2 00 in the morning the woman had a room at the beverly hilton so at least he is not another politician screwing the poor
8090143 well heres the latest on john edwards vice presidential chances too much vice not enough presidential have you heard this story the mainstream media is now starting to report on a story that was first broken by the national enquirer this week the national enquirer claimed they caught john edwards visiting his mistress at 2 40 in the morning at the beverly hills hotel monday night and when a team of reporters confronted him he ran and hid in the mens room and you know who was in there senator larry craig what are the odds
8090144 how about this john edwards thing imagine that a personal injury attorney who turns out to be a sleaze ball who could have seen that coming
8090145 john edwards has admitted to having an affair but hes denying that he is the father of the womans baby in fact he says a member of his campaign staff is the babys father campaign staff how does that work what was edwards running late that day huh had to send an advance man in look i cant have sex with you im sending bob down
8090146 i thought this was nice at one point during the olympic ceremony tonight they had 56 children march in all belonging to john edwards
8090147 i guess edwards apparently met this woman at a new york city bar in 2006 and he is a pretty smooth operator
8090148 no he actually said today about the other woman he doesnt love her oh thats smart now youve got two women mad at you great way to go
8090149 you know what it turns out she was his campaign videographer yeah there you go think therell be a sex tape coming soon huh
8090150 well democrats are furious theyre going on record now saying john edwards will not be allowed to speak at the convention because of this affair yeah instead speaking in his place bill clinton you have to put your foot down
8090151 in fact when john mccain heard about the john edwards affair he said well thank god i cant get an erection anymore whew some problems just take care of themselves
8090152 21 constituy un juego franc s de casino muy popular durante el siglo xviii el cual ingres en los estados unidos m s o menos en la misma poca que el poker
8090153 the theme of the democratic convention is unity unfortunately they cant agree on how that works
8090154 detroit mayor kwame kilpatrick will not be going to the dem convo yeah having some problems
8090155 this thursday barack obama is gonna give his acceptance speech and reportedly its going to include performances by bon jovi and bruce springsteen yeah and they say obamas not black enough
8090156 of course obamas supporters got him his usual birthday gift of gold frankincense and myrrh
8090157 well you know at the democratic convention this week in denver both bill and hillary will be speaking not to each other of course
8090158 joe biden is barack obamas running mate yeah nothing says change like a guy whos been in the senate for 35 years
8090159 as you know john mccain is an older white haired man who has been in the senate for over twenty years voted for the iraq war and said barack obama did not have the experience to be president im sorry thats our intro for next week when joe biden is on i got confused
8090160 yeah the democratic convention is in denver and security is tight out there it is very tight its tighter than nancy pelosis face
8090161 and barack obama now says he is open to offshore oil drilling so apparently when he promised change he was talking about his mind i guess thats what that was
8090162 the democratic national convention continued in boston as rising star barack obama wowed the crowd with the best keynote address in recent memory obama was so impressive the partys considering having him give john kerrys concession speech
8090163 the democratic national committee released its lineup of the politicians that will speak at the convention and hillary clinton is not on the list but today bill told her dont feel bad none of his other women are speaking either
8090164 did you see any of that convention oh my god wow for that kind of excitement you had to go back to the gore lieberman era
8090165 how many of you saw john kerrys acceptance speech its the first time hes ever said i do and didnt get any money
8090166 at the convention john kerry showed up with all his vietnam crewmates and not to be outdone next month at the republican convention george w bush is going to show up with all his college drinking buddies
8090167 did you see john edwards speaking his speech was so dull that teresa heinz kerry told him to shove it
8090168 edwards speech was so good when he finished the delegates awarded him 80 million plus punitive damages
8090169 the democratic national convention gets under way this week in boston which is tragically preparing for its turn at the national stage by the way all the security isnt to keep people out its to keep people in during hillarys speech
8090170 the kerry campaign said that john kerry will show his softer side at the convention you already see him and edwards fondling each other what are they going to be spooning now
8090171 hey everyone its jen just wanted to let you know that i am home finally
8090172 kevin will be remembered by fans as one of the most popular and recognizable players to ever wear the blazers uniform but to people who knew him hell be remembered as one of the warmest and biggest hearted
8090173 i guess i made a mistake in cutting a joke
8090174 i know a little bit about how the white house works and you know if the president isnt exactly on our side call the first lady and with michelle obama and were going to somebody who answers that phone
8090175 i want to be able to forgive barack obama but what happened to hillary bugs me
8090176 just remember this over the last eight years youve been falling behind
8090177 over the last eight years your lives are less secure
8090178 john mccain has lifelong experience of serving his country he is without question qualified to be president of the united states
8090179 if we win ill go down as having the lowest iq of any genius who ever lived
8090180 im really happy that i dont have to pick four players this morning i can tell you that
8090181 it would have been very difficult to know what to do
8090182 im looking for the hottest players but they dont play for the united states
8090183 so i can look at the top 12 guys and maybe make a choice just based on that
8090184 this is a significant step for me to get back out on the practice field
8090185 if things go well as we expect they will then i hope to be full go next week and ready for the season opener
8090186 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8090187 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8090188 its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize
8090189 like everything else in life there are times that you have to make an adjustment
8090190 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8090191 any time you try to change something in baseball its both emotional and difficult
8090192 theres been some concern that well if you start here look what its going to lead to
8090193 a slap in the face of umpires that have been here for a long time
8090194 it overshot the mark by far just because what in a yankee game someone didnt get a homer please its happened thousands of times
8090195 thats part of the game its the beauty of the game mistakes are made
8090196 i find it very strange that with 30 games to go in the season that they would start it now i find that very peculiar
8090197 if they wanted it so bad what took them so long to get it going and why wait until this particular point in time
8090198 some people thought that we ought to wait until the postseason
8090199 id rather go into the postseason knowing that weve already used it
8090200 it was a great course hilly different i loved the trail run
8090201 the conservation commission could have property availed itself of the provisions of rsa 91 a 3 right to know law and discussed the performance of the young man who was the subject of this portion of the meeting in non public session
8090202 aunt dorie had told henry to stay away from nicky noland and his brothers somebody brought them to church on the two sundays of the annual attendance contests with zion baptist
8090203 and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
8090204 i understand and this is like maybe 50 years or something like that so again over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
8090205 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8090206 you shall not kill the embryo by abortion and shall not cause the newborn to perish
8090207 the greatest thing youll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return
8090208 we are calling for a cease fire for both sides to talk rather than shoot each other
8090209 what we are doing we are doing to have all out peace in mindanao
8090210 if were not more deeply in love next year we shall have failed
8090211 president arroyo is such a lame duck right now that she lacks the political capital to get any constitutional amendment passed in the final year plus of her term so the milf could be in limbo for another two to three years until a new president is settled in

8090220 bittersweet batch which should please anyone with a love of this heartfelt style
8090221 high commitment high performance ceos somehow seem to comfortably bear the tension of reconciling the relentless demands of the market with their role as steward of their people these leaders are clearly energized by delivering on their larger mission by soundly thrashing their competitors in the marketplace and by directly connecting with the people in their firms
8090222 leaders of high commitment and high performance organizations refuse to choose between people and profits
8090223 i have been involved in sports for a very long time being a sports official
8090224 i used to be in charge of snooker later after the cricket association was established i got to know more and more about cricket and began to like it more and more so i changed from snooker to cricket
8090225 i think that cricket in china is already moving ahead
8090226 they have 140 level one coaches and umpires now theyve achieved that in the period since 2005 that is indeed very noteworthy
8090227 the icc has believed for quite some time that there is a real opportunity for cricket in china and one of our projects is to explore the possibility of cricket becoming very large in this country
8090228 china has such a strategic approach to everything they wont be benchmarking against some atoll in the pacific
8090229 they will be saying what is the world standard and trying to better it seeking prominence and world recognition
8090230 the icc came to us and said they had a very charming game which could be introduced to china and at that time the then vice president and secretary general of the cca paid a visit to hong kong to observe the hong kong international sixes
8090231 we found that cricket is a very good for chinese people because it emphasises hand eye co ordination
8090232 now what we need to do urgently is improve our high performance
8090233 with high performance in the big events such as the asian games we can grab the attention of a mass of the people so it will then be easier to promote cricket they will know it and they will love it
8090234 man oh man what a great feeling and great week finally getting to see daniele she means the world to me and it was so super to finally get to see her and talk to her i will be posting pictures of us at a later time

8090239 all i could think about was whether there were enough lifeboats for all of us
8090240 most of the bodies were floating inside they were trapped when the seven story ship suddenly tilted and capsized
8090241 we learned from the news that a storm was coming but we were confident when we left manila that everything was o k because the weather at the time seemed perfect

8090251 the marks on the ground tell us that the plane hit the ground tail first and as a result the tail cone the end part of the plane broke off
8090252 i guess i did realize that when the plane was going to take off perhaps it was not going so fast
8090253 and i said to myself something is going on here
8090254 i grabbed the seat i noticed a bump my stomach was rising and falling
8090255 there were children who had seats on top of them what i did was pull them out and set them aside so they were not trapped
8090256 i know a lot is being made of this but i think any human being at any time when people ask for help will give it
8090257 it is a contradictory feeling because i know that bodies are arriving back there and i will arrive intact
8090258 barack obama is a charming and fine person with a lovely family but hes not ready to be president

8090269 essere protagonista non voglia di protagonismo ma amore di identit
8090270 qualora uno stato dovesse tradire questanima tradirebbe la gente in ci che ha di pi intimo e pi suo
8090271 lanima popolare e il senso di appartenenza ad una identit che crea comunione tra gli uomini e permette la comunit di vita
8090272 la storia che manifesta leclisse dello spirito va contro luomo diventa
8090273 intaccare direttamente i valori spirituali e morali di una comunit e di un paese attaccare la sua integrit e fare cattiva storia
8090274 il vangelo non per pochi iniziati ma per tutti cos la chiesa non per delle elites ma chiesa di popolo
8090275 via della discesa del nascondimento della condivisone quotidiana paziente e fiduciosa della vita della gente
8090276 come sale e lievito partecipa alla costruzione della storia universale
8090277 la memoria della sua creazione della sua dignit e della sua caduta la memoria della sua redenzione in cristo
8090278 e da questa memoria che essa guarda la storia vedendola sempre come storia di salvezza
8090279 a partire da questa memoria custodita e amata ha quindi proseguito lo storia ruota attorno alla concezione delluomo che nel cristianesimo giunge alla sua pienezza e che sta alla base dellumanesimo europeo
8090280 la chiesa dice al mondo in particolare oggi alleuropa che il passato non pu essere impunemente negato in nome delleconomia della tecnologia o dello scientismo
8090281 il popolo di dio chiamato a partecipare alla storia umana anche con la difesa della ragione
8090282 affermare lefficacia della ragione non totalmente altro dallannuncio evangelico non significa diminuire il vangelo per impicciarsi di argomenti di competenza altrui
8090283 ricorda che il ruolo del passato ha rilievo ed ha un valore imprescindibile per loggi pena lo sfaldamento dellidentit di una nazione o di un continente pena lo smarrimento personale e collettivo di un popolo che non sa pi chi sia e dove vada

8090286 jb whered you hear that joke at my dad had a professer that actually pulled that stunt the professer at state that invented the pop top cant remember his name said he was a real asshole
8090287 this response embarrassed me as an american to think that there are people in my country who still today are so confused by the 9 11 terrorist attacks and who perpetrated them
8090288 so this is going to be quick and random a flow of stream of consciousness

8090294 here is a candidate senator bigdraws who has lambasted a fine eatery such as ryans which places restroom cleaniness as its number one goal for 2008 ryans is as american as apple pie and he has single handedly crippled their profitability with unverified remarks the mac and beef industry also has protested his actions as have the american gastroenterologists society in the medical field who say his claims are without merit and state that projectile diarrhea will not ensue until 6 8 hours later not immediately after 4 heaping plate fulls as the senator has stated clearly a false statement and this man is not credible to lead this great nation
8090295 i bet any minute now some idiot air force chief is going to walk by put his face to the window and ask what were selling

8090303 look i dont know what kind of bleeding heart liberal pansy ass stuff theyre teaching sailors in bootcamp today but i dont call anyone by their first name it breeds familiarity and that leads to a breakdown in authority i refer to my sailors by their last name only smith jones baker thats all i am to be referred to only as chief do i make myself clear

8090305 the obama campaign also announced 16 campaign events across the country to highlight the comment and try to turn the tables on mccains effort to cast him as an elitist obama and his wife michelle reported making 4 2 million in 2007

8090310 so tonight was the big brother 8 wrap party which was soooooo much fun it was so bittersweet though because it means that now the show is officially done and i must move on with my life lol
8090311 thats one reason why cbs is spreading its programming to other websites
8090312 big brother 8 reality show this summer cbs offered photos participants diaries show recaps and full episodes on its website
8090313 big brother couldnt have been more thrilled to see dick take the title from daniele
8090314 you can count on me to speak about fair accurate and transparent elections in every breath i take
8090315 candidates ask voters to stand up for them by donating money volunteering and through their votes now its time for candidates to commit to standing for voters
8090316 in recent elections weve seen candidates shy away from challenging even obviously incorrect election results supposedly because they dont want to be called sore losers signing the standing for voters pledge is a clear way to tell voters that you care that all votes are counted and counted accurately and that you will do everything in your power to ensure that the elections are held to the highest standards even if you dont win your election you can champion the cause of democracy
8090317 i am standing for voters i took the super pledge
8090318 because we offer the emblem to candidates based on their word but any candidate who puts the emblem on their website should expect their supporters to hold them to their commitment
8090319 since they are often transported on an electronic memory card that fits easily into a pocket
8090320 you can count on me to speak about fair accurate and transparent elections in every breath i take

8090393 why on the application it says you must be 21 and older to apply to be on big brother and they still let daniells on the show she was 20 at the time and turned 21 while already in the house double standard that means in all rights legally zach and dick are the final 2 someone needs to bring that up to power being on cbs otherwise this does validate this season was totally rigged by the producers
8090394 i just wanted to point out that dani under 21 isnt a violation weather she applied or not
8090395 the producers reserve the right to change any of the application terms at anytime or to select or not select anyone at their sole discretion

8090452 in the us quite the opposite situation may be occurring with its own big brother brand
8090453 cbss big brother 8 has gotten completely out of control with its acceptance of violence against women and hate speech

8090516 we totally understand the clients position on this as a large company such as them have much more at stake than a small one such as ours and the legal issues are probably a little scarier to them

8090540 i have been a big brother fan since season one and understand there will be all types of people and opinions in the house however i cannot tolerate the antisemitic comments continuously made on the live feed by this years houseguest amber it is that type of ignorant thinking that has been the cause of harrassment torment and the demise of millions of jews by speaking her intolernce toward the jewish people she is not only sparking the flames of hate for other anti semites but also insulting and literally throwing stones at judaism and all of the jewish big brother fans this type of bashing is dangerous in many ways i would hope that cbs will review these statements and take action i know that cbs and big brother would not in any way want to contribute to such antisemitic bashing but by allowing such behavior you are condoning it i am tired of living in a world where it is socially acceptable to make prejudiced and antisemitic statements and jokes i now cannot even watch my favorite reality show without listening to such demeaning statements please do not accept what so many know is wrong but are not strong enough to stand up for in best regards amy some of ambers comments made while talking on the live feed amber tells jameeka that majority of new yorks she knows are messed up and says her and her family dont like jewish people on site says her sister will say i dont really like them ad her mom will say do you know why its cause they are jewish and amber said how do you know and her mom says you can tell by her name amber is sayign is no wonder eric is wierd since hes a new york jew amber tells story about how she helps other waitresses with pointing out good tippers if she is going on break and they have someone on staff who is sellfish and her mom says thats cause they are jewish amber telling jameka that people from new york are all as holes and money hungry and so are jewish people and goes on to talk about some girl she knew

8090551 i sent emails to cbs endemol usa and alison grodner productions asking if they would be doing anything to amber
8090552 its always great to have fans that are this engaged and passionate about big brother however we also need to protect the integrity of the competition which does not allow any outside influence on the houseguests who are sequestered from the public broadcast and therefore unaware of some of the secret twists in the show

8091084 from sammypants big brother marcellas is out and now howie janelle is losing her ground
8091085 howie janelle is at least playing the game boogie and will are running the game howie is doing nothing but being annoying
8091086 i like janelle i never didnt like janelle i think as a person shes funny shes smart and shes a beautiful girl she might not be someone you want to play a game like big brother all stars with but shes definitely someone you want to have manis petis and drinks with looking back if i could do something different i wouldnt have thrown the hoh comp to janelle which led to diane an erika being nominated i would have taken it and put up mike boogie and janelle
8091087 each evicted houseguest walks out the front door straight into a live interview with julie chen
8091088 so ivette how did you get involved with big brother
8091089 marcellas reynolds is known for a couple things his sharp wit hosting the big brother internet talk show house calls and making the most monumental error in the reality shows history
8091090 marcellas meet your new amy this time her name is janelle
8091091 just give me a bag of salad would it kill you to give me some baby spinach and endives can a brother get a grape tomato
8091092 when big brother finally ended two weeks ago the spotlight was naturally on its eventual winner dick donato but aside from the limelight coming from his somewhat controversial triumph numerous questions arose surrounding the true nature of his relationship with his daughter and regarding the abuse he heaped profusely on practically all of his fellow houseguests
8091093 and the eviction goes to despite assurances that he was only a pawn marcellas didnt feel safe after replacing the veto winner as a nominee
8091094 the pages of big brother history are littered with the corpses of people who thought they were safe
8091095 if youre going to declare war on someone you better finish the battle
8091096 just a simple girl from a small town named chill
8091097 marcellas reynolds was evicted last night and became the first member of the
8091098 this is what im feeling this is what i was thinking when she said this this is what i was thinking when he said that this is the experience im having right this moment
8091099 fans of big brother 7 all stars got more insight into rockfords george boswell on sunday as head of household george was the most powerful contestant earning him more airtime and more attention from his housemates
8091100 i have always said hes smarter than he lets on
8091101 hes the most scary player in the game you know why no one knows what hes doing
8091102 james was an easy one james had nominated me james was my true target
8091103 dick donatos celebrity connection came as promised to support one of big brother historys most controversial winners the multi tattooed chain smoking cuss popping spitting hacking flatulent elder donato proudly declared to his daughter ahead of big brother 8s finale that one of his special guests would be the frontman of the band suicidal tendencies true enough the idol showed up to cheer for the man many have come to call evil
8091104 big brother 7 house in the most exciting dismissal yet
8091105 ive been better im in the tropics but id rather be in there kicking some big brother ass but you cant win them all
8091106 i was pissed off this is reality television i was very mad i said my goodbyes to janie and james georgie tried to hug me and give me some crap whatever it was ultimately i made my way to mike boogie because this guy said he was my alliance member had my back and then sold me out ive never thrown a first punch a day in my life ive never hit anybody out of anger and i wasnt gonna do it this time i think i got up in his face i said chill towns word is mush i wasnt gonna walk out the door looking at the ground
8091107 i held to my contract i didnt speak to anybody before the show i didnt breach contract it was 10 on four coming into the house it was 10 people coming after four bb6 ers you had people out there with pre game alliances people dating it was hard to acknowledge and accept who had peoples backs
8091108 i have an inclination on what it is either boogie or will possesses it its gonna be that if you put one of them up they can take theirself off and then nominate whoever they want of their choice if they put up a bb6 er theyre not gonna have the votes to stay so janie or james are gonna be sent home quickly here
8091109 i trusted james in the house i dont think he was coming after me at the same time he wanted to go to his parachute dani he wanted to go to the end with her his friend i dont think he wouldve put me up
8091110 i really hate the guy and i hate his family and i hate his existence right now because he swore to me twice that he was gonna keep me safe he promised me twice he was gonna keep me safe and he went against his word and i take that personally
8091111 big brother 8 has come to a close and cbs is already taking applications for season 9 last week i got the chance to attend the live big brother 8 finale head into the backyard and interview the cast below is my chat with the big brother 8 winner dick donato there is also a video clip below of dick talking to real networks i shot with my digital cam while waiting for the interview
8091112 your target is mike boogie put someone up thats going to weaken him
8091113 youre gonna pee down my back and tell me its raining
8091114 you have to do whats right for you whats best for you
8091115 listen i came for revenge i just wanted you out i cant believe i came here and found forgiveness
8091116 my alliance wants to put you up but i dont want to
8091117 what im supposed to be closer to you than your alliance im going to vote them out for you thats part of the deal
8091118 will and i are very good friends but it would be a nice coup detat five years later to show him that maybe mike boogie is just as smart as his is i would like to take a shot at him i can be a very smart player that can be very dangerous in this game
8091119 there was even a man in a chicken suit who carried a cardboard sign painted with the words
8091120 the second clue in a game that lets the winner have more power in saying who gets evicted from the
8091121 big brother 8 will forever go down as the season of the donatos the father daughter duo with their big personalities and enticing back story stole the headlines for much of the summer a fact that likely pleased cbs to no end big brother 8 had more to offer than just dick and daniele and when looking back on the season in its entirety its fun to realize just how much went on for those three long months in the big brother house there were severe tonal shifts from a number of players and a striking amount of faulty first impressions alison grodners first season in charge of the franchise was rocky at times and while her maiden voyage cannot be deemed a complete success the ratings were up and loyal fans remained loyal
8091122 they cant find anyone in the real world who can truly love them and understand them or at least make out with them except other similarly damaged reality show contestants its lonely being at the top of bottom feeder hollywood
8091123 dick and daniele donato will go down as one of the most infamous pairs to ever grace the world of reality tv the big brother 8 champion dick and runner up daniele made their share of enemies along the way with an aggressive style of play but it all worked out in the end when the father daughter duo found themselves alone in the big brother house having vanquished 12 other houseguests earlier today on their first day of freedom in months we were lucky enough to speak with dick and daniele to discuss their season of big brother domination the donato haters of the world may not want to read much further for the pair are as outspoken and brash here as they had been throughout the big brother season
8091124 cbs has come through on its promise to keep you glued to your computer for just a little while longer
8091125 it further helps us extend the reach of the cbs brand and provides a new avenue for advertisers to engage with our programming which in turn creates a new source of revenue for our company
8091126 ill split the money with you if you take me to the final 2 and i win
8091127 the games cbs plays from the redoing of the hoh comp to give it to whom they wanted to so does the coup detat phrase fits into this catagory there are so many phrases to make from the clues right now that i believe they are just waiting for the right house guest to ring the bell and guess and then they are going to say thats it making the hgs that they dont want to win just waste their chance and time by guessing
8091128 dick made it all the way through big brother 8 with daughter daniele and ended up taking home the big prize but that final vote cannot excuse the way he acted along the way dick was one of the most obnoxious crude and vile personalities to ever appear on reality tv and the reality tv hall of shame would be remiss if we did not induct him read on to find out all the reasons including many that never made it to your tv screen
8091129 big brother 8 jury would give the grand prize to daniele donato not her estranged father
8091130 spinning in a chair for two minutes then carrying a full glass of champagne to a pedestal then ringing a bell
8091131 viewers were preoccupied by the angst and antics of would be cooks comics and other entertainers during another slow week on television
8091132 yes people i know i am the one who wanted him fucked but that was the fan in me watching the show who was worried their favorite character was about to go home
8091133 a well known phrase that applies to the big brother game
8091134 janelle went after danielle and erika when she nominated them for eviction sunday night on big brother 7 all stars
8091135 we can be nice to chicken george because we may need him later in the game
8091136 by a vote of five to two dick donato defeated his daughter daniele to win big brother 8 only jameka and jen voted for daniele
8091137 janelle this weeks head of household nominated danielle and erika tonight on big brother 7 all stars
8091138 danielle you put me up last week and were unsuccessful
8091139 erika feel youve been floating and playing all sides of the house
8091140 pretty early on we went to chicken george and we were like whats up with you and chill town and he said i dont know i was forced into an alliance with them we were laughing so hard like george what do you mean how do you get forced into an alliance
8091141 i dont know if i can do that because its not really fair to james
8091142 given danieles infuriating personality i kinda got a perverse pleasure in seeing her father win season 8 of big brother by a 5 2 vote considering that i didnt want to see either of them win at all i like so many of you considered boycotting the finale because i knew it would be terribly anticlimactic much like the year rob and amber made it to the final two on survivor and truth be told i started checking out of bb days ago first because the emmys were upon us and i had to focus my energy on wishing for a two and a half men upset in the best comedy category and then because i needed to find my happy place since a new season of mcdreamy was only days away but i had to experience this final hour if only to enjoy the payoff of seeing the houseguests reaction to eric being americas player
8091143 we all knew that a donato was going to win it was just a matter of which one
8091144 if youre going to declare war on someone you better finish the battle
8091145 kaysar ridhas eviction from the big brother all stars house could be the best birthday present hes ever received
8091146 im kind of glad to be out so i can follow up on that now we are still pushing to try and get me on the movie
8091147 i dont know whats happened since being on bb i have to call my manager but i know they like me i was highly recommended
8091148 i knew james was ready to jump ship but i desperately desperately tried to keep him on board i saw it coming but i thought it was going to come a little bit later
8091149 i dont think this legion of doom is going to stick together because there is no loyalty amongst them
8091150 the reason why will and boogie are still in the game is because they are dishonest will is a previous winner and for that reason we wanted to maintain another target other than the season 6
8091151 all stars is a much different game weve got big egos weve got big personalities and weve got some heavy hitters in there who are willing to go the distance
8091152 i want the best player to win so if someone is going to win it by lying cheating backstabbing and deceit i say do it all the way
8091153 because no matter how indifferent youve been to tv this summer when it comes to exquisitely debased feeble entertainment theres nothing quite like the pointless talent competitions and frivolous social experiments that air during the long hot months in the middle of the year
8091154 the third time was not the charm for kaysar ridha
8091155 now im on slop sleeping on the floor having no hot showers getting backdoored not competing in the veto competition not getting any prizes getting evicted on my birthday and walking out with no hair
8091156 right now wills jugular is exposed we have to get rid of him and take him out
8091157 this is what we are doing and this is who we are
8091158 just to let you know im not a part of that
8091159 after 81 days and countless dramas evel dick emerged as the 500 000 winner of big brother 8 with his daughter daniele taking the 50 000 second prize the dynamic donato duo certainly faced their share of controversy and managed to survive being on the block with each other three times the day after their big win the two shared their favorite moments of the summer what they plan to do with the money and some surprisingly tender insights about each other

8091368 we share the same common goal as the iraqi government and that is to turn over more and more of the security responsibilities to the iraqi security forces
8091369 thats proceeding well but at the end of the day nothing changes from the fact that we believe strongly that the withdrawal of u s forces of coalition forces ought to be based on the conditions on the ground and what we are seeing is a dramatically improved situation in iraq with respect to security and an ever increasingly capable iraqi security force

8091373 while kashmiris in the valley vehemently opposed the move the fascist hindu organization rss orchestrated violent protests in jammu region
8091374 by doing so the latter has succeeded in completely communalizing the issue
8091375 the government has utterly failed in amicably solving the issue the state is in utter shambles
8091376 the situation is alarming it is no more the handiwork of the terrorists from across the border or the mercenaries hired by isi as has too often been claimed by the government of india
8091377 the voices of azadi are fast becoming the popular will there is no denying the fact that the kashmir valley is speaking for itself and not a mouthpiece of neighboring pakistan
8091378 no amount of physical force can browbeat and crush the political aspirations of people state terrorism has never been a solution to a political problem encouraging communal outfits like rss to stage manage a parallel agitation can prove to be suicidal for the country rss has always played the politics of hate towards minorities in indian and the clich s like patriotism nationalism integrity etc merely tend to serve as trump cards a mere coating for hindutava
8091379 this situation should have been utilized to initiate political dialogue instead of the visit by the national security advisor

8091390 fable 2 is like 30 extra and none of its worth it imo
8091391 an issue has risen over the past couple of weeks on big brother 8 its one that has certainly come up before and often among fans of the show but its never felt as pronounced as it has lately the dick versus jen argument has become the most volatile of the season polarizing fans and directing venom at cbs you see for fans who only watch the three episode a week prime time cbs version of big brother you know only parts of the story live feeders have a much different perspective the basic argument is this cbs unfairly skewed the coverage of the dick vs jen feud in favor of dick making jen look far worse than she actually was and making dick seem much better
8091392 the ghost of jen continued to make waves in the house even after her departure
8091393 i have a mate that works for sony who has always been correct
8091394 he was very close to returning but the great part about michael is that he takes his time to think about things and he is very thorough
8091395 you can get excited about coming back and running through the tunnel one more time
8091396 in the end he felt he could not get back to where he was
8091397 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8091398 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8091399 its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize
8091400 we know the parameters of the contract and the giants would have been generous
8091401 we knew it was a long shot but we owed it to ourselves to exhaust the possibility
8091402 we appreciate michael even considering ending his retirement he has a new career in front of him and we wish him nothing but the best as we all said when he announced his retirement michael was and is a great giant
8091403 there is a reason he went in the first round obviously
8091404 the guy he is playing behind strahan and osi and then we moved him to linebacker so obviously he is one of our top players on the team and he is going to show that he is a top defensive end in the league
8091405 we know we are a confident team and we are a playoff capable team and we have to go out and perform like it
8091406 the reason we took the underdog role last year was because everybody said it and we just went with it were not thinking like that this year we do have a chip on our shoulders and it grows more and more when somebody gives us something to feed off of
8091407 the only reason he will come back is if he wants to play
8091408 no creo que hayamos dado un paso atr s en nuestra preparaci n quiz s no fuimos tan precisos pero tuvimos un oponente que tambi n juega y tuvimos cinco o seis ocasiones en las que s lo nos quedaba el portero por vencer perdimos pero pudimos haber ganado o empatado

8091456 this is a government center that is going to last for quite some time so im feeling the weight of that decision
8091457 we must practice what we preach it is unfair to criticize centrepointe and then pursue a new government center without public input
8091458 is this the absolute best spot to place it or is it one block up or is it in the third street corridor
8091459 given centrepointe and all that has come out of that the last thing you want is to build a government building that really is public property in the middle of downtown and not have that kind of inclusion

8091466 if woolworths appeal is unsuccessful again both companies are in the same position
8091467 we have previously put some strong arguments to the commission and the courts as to why any acquisition would be lawful i am comfortable that the supreme court will be in a position to properly consider the issues
8091468 we will await with interest the outcome of the woolworths appeal and as we have consistently said we would not rule anything in or anything out going forward

8091490 eso es muy relativo no creo que deba uno sentirse confiado por ser local pero siempre cuenta el apoyo de la afici n

8091505 ia seperti pangeran di milan dan di chelsea filosofi kami berbeda kami tidak memiliki pangeran setiap orang harus bekerja seperti yang lainnya dan setiap orang harus membuktikan kalau dirinya pantas dimainkan
8091506 saya rasa mungkin ia kehilangan sebagian kepercayaan dirinya selangkah demi selangkah seorang pemain akan berjalan ke arah yang salah
8091507 ia bukanlah pilihan pertama saya namun chelsea memberikannya kepada saya sebagai pilihan kedua saya yakin di masa mendatang ia akan kembali menjadi pemain berkualitas tinggi kenyataannya adalah saya tidak pernah memiliki masalah pribadi dengannya dan saya mendokannya yang terbaik di masa depan
8091508 i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially

8091516 i was just hanging in here and seeing if i could pull this out
8091517 i dont give up until i absolutely cant do it any more and thats what happened to me today
8091518 i just want you to know marcellas gave me the slop pass
8091519 i dont want to use it in case you get stuck on the slop
8091520 i would not have given it to you if i didnt want you to have it
8091521 that put marcellas on quite a big pedestal for me

8091533 many of our top fundraisers in attendance can attend a range of different events thanking them for the work they have been and are doing to help change washington
8091534 this is a way for us to show our appreciation
8091535 you want to be nice to them make sure they have nice hotels and good transportation and good seats
8091536 the party also can provide access to important decision makers thats what pleases contributors
8091537 any time the umps convene and talk about it why not be sure and get it right for anything other than home runs though i think itd be tough unless they had another ump up in the booth other calls thats the human element part of the game and i think they should just leave that alone
8091538 i think it should have been implemented a long time ago in some of the newer stadiums its a tough call being a third baseman i have the same view that the umps have and whenever theres a questionable call i go look at the video and realize that what i thought i saw was wrong half the time this way theyll get the call right every time and thats the main thing
8091539 and the way its laid out its going to be so rare that they even use it i can remember one ball in oakland this year where it probably would have been reviewed itll probably be tougher in the newer parks but they are calls that have such a big impact on a game i think its a good idea the way its been explained to me
8091540 i think its good for home runs as long as they stick with that keep it to home runs
8091541 i dont think the delays are going to take that long either because theyll get a look at all the different angles we can get now
8091542 i dont think they should expand it to anything else though if you start doing that where does it stop youll have to look at strike zones and close plays at first and everything else and then it will slow the game down if you do that why even have umpires
8091543 that the sinker is up in the zone a little bit and we can make him work a little bit and we can get the ball up off him and see if hes off and do some damage and score some runs
8091544 yeah its very important with sinker ballers you dont want them to get in a groove and get a great feel of their sinkers
8091545 it is time to take back the country we love and whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose

8091566 the key function of the nsg is to formulate guidelines for managing exports of nuclear material equipment and technology to ensure that this trade does not contribute to nuclear weapons proliferation
8091567 while new zealand remains a strong advocate of the nuclear non proliferation treaty npt and the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty ctbt and would welcome indias accession to these treaties we have not included these elements in our package of proposals
8091568 while noting concerns and the need for consistency in pursuing the objective of non proliferation
8091569 a large number of countries big and small expressed views similar to new zealands that there needed to be compatibility between the us india agreement and the goals of the nsg and indicated a willingness to engage positively to achieve that outcome
8091570 the nsg exemption should be clean and there should be no additional condition
8091571 they may want to push but india cant be pushed civil nuclear cooperation is important but that doesnt mean at any cost
8091572 should we allow ourselves to be pushed are we not indians are you not proud of yourself and what you are doing

8091593 however we have reduced that risk by purchasing the wagons ourselves over five years we expect to get some good harvest results in victoria and new south wales
8091594 the deal goes a long way to putting more grain on rail without this there is only the graincorp and pacific national deal its a good service but would have been spread thin with bumper crops between the two it will get the majority of commercially viable grain on rail
8091595 police were doing a roadside radar monitor on the western highway and they detected a car travelling east bound down the western highway towards melbourne at a speed which indicated to be 181 kilometres an hour
8091596 there were four other passengers in the car from horsham and ballarat
8091597 obviously with the hoon legislation weve got the authority to impound a vehicle which is travelling more than 45 kilometres an hour over the speed limit
8091598 the vehicle was impounded and investigators are in the process of putting a brief of evidence together for traffic offences
8091599 there is that much advertising on television in relation to the danger of speeding and the consequences
8091600 theyve just got to be aware of their speed and the danger of doing such speeds
8091601 ive always had the feeling that i can still contribute more
8091602 i just feel we really need to do a lot more with economic development
8091603 i now understand what a lot of sporting people say if youre still enjoying it keep going
8091604 i am going to stand again there are things that i havent achieved yet its been difficult but we could do a lot better in economic development
8091605 its a hard time for small regional councils you have to battle for every dollar and it takes some experience
8091606 im enjoying my portfolio very much and want to get involved more
8091607 there are lots of issues with services for elderly people we are an ageing population and weve got to get things right ive had three years and im prepared to give it another go
8091608 he described himself and his ex wife as addicts which led to the relationship breakdown
8091609 he started using again in 2006 which was a bad year for him physically and emotionally
8091610 cultivating at that time of year wouldnt come to much fruition
8091611 he inquired about whether it was legal and at the time was told it was lawful but two months later it became prohibited
8091612 he could have applied for possession because he is a member of the association
8091613 i think they are being extremely horsham centric and theyre missing the point
8091614 the federal and state governments have invested in the pipeline so water is saved for the environment
8091615 why would anyone in their right mind deserve to have two water bodies five to 10 kilometres away from each other
8091616 theyve got to start thinking about the community downstream every time someone proposes to take 8000 megalitres out of the savings pool it means 8000 megalitres is coming out of the river
8091617 students in year nine everywhere seem to be fairly disengaged and disinterested in traditional schooling and there is a high level of absenteeism
8091618 there are not many schools running this program here in the wimmera but across victoria more and more schools are adopting it
8091619 small students teams will identify specific needs in the local and broader community and work towards achieving solutions
8091620 were interested to hear what people in the community think about how our students can work with them
8091621 we are altering the way students are taught so students spend a longer time with particular teachers
8091622 our year nines will be located in the one building and the program will include components of our core subjects english maths science and humanities
8091623 classes will be less constrained by bell times and more flexible to adapt to students needs and interests
8091624 teachers will work as a team and develop better relationships with students
8091625 most people use standard e mail programs from or simply thunderbird
8091626 make3d converts your single picture into a 3 d model completely automatically

8091628 el reconocimiento de los estados es materia de decisi n de los estados soberanos
8091629 el secretario general lamenta que los esfuerzos en curso para encontrar una soluci n com n de la crisis en georgia dentro del consejo de seguridad de la onu puedan complicarse
8091630 esta decisi n es inconsistente con numerosas resoluciones del consejo de seguridad de la onu que rusia vot en el pasado
8091631 abjasia y osetia del sur se encuentran dentro de las fronteras internacionalmente reconocidas de georgia y as deben seguir la acci n de rusia solo exacerba las tensiones y complica las negociaciones diplom ticas
8091632 el pueblo de osetia del sur y el de abjasia se han pronunciado en varias oportunidades con referendos a favor de la independencia
8091633 no cuestionamos la soberan a y la independencia de georgia pero osetia del sur y abjasia tienen derecho a la autodeterminaci n seg n la carta de las naciones unidas y otros instrumentos internacionales
8091634 est bamos avanzando pero la integridad territorial de georgia era parte esencial
8091635 la atm sfera actual me recuerda a la situaci n que se viv a en europa en 1914 cuando a causa de un terrorista se enfrentaron las principales potencias del mundo
8091636 espero que saakashvili no pase a la historia como un nuevo gavrilo princip
8091637 lo que podemos estar presenciando no es s lo el fin de la guerra fr a o el pasaje de un periodo particular de la historia de posguerra sino el fin de la historia como tal
8091638 al punto final de la evoluci n ideol gica de la humanidad y la universalizaci n de la democracia liberal occidental como la forma final de gobierno humano
8091639 i dont care what jesse jackson does im going to this convention and im going to win
8091640 obama agrees to roll call vote for clinton does that make him a sissy
8091641 the democratic national convention is now shaping up to be quite a party for hillary clinton her name will be placed in nomination shell give a prime time address
8091642 overall between 1972 and 1992 10 democratic candidates who lost the nomination in the primaries went on to have their names formally placed in nomination at the convention
8091643 sure hillarys fat and waddly and screechy and gives pantsuits a bad name
8091644 reports of strife between negotiators for sen hillary clinton and sen barack obama are exaggerated
8091645 multiple sources in both campaigns have described the negotiations as relatively free of acrimony
8091646 my sources say the obama campaign was enthusiastic about the idea of putting clintons name in nomination having independently reached the conclusion that it was the best way to honor her achievement and do more to win over her supporters
8091647 the conversations with her folks were very cordial and weve been able to work very closely with them as we unify this party we couldnt be happier about how things are going with senator clinton and her team
8091648 hillary clintons attempt tacitly to take over the obama victory
8091649 i thought journalists were supposed to uncover the facts and report the story not decide on the story and then interpret the facts to accommodate their storyline
8091650 russia rolls over georgia hillary clinton does the same to barack obama now we know whos boss
8091651 if hillary clinton can ride roughshod over this guy what do you think bin laden will do
8091652 russia invades georgia hillary invades obamas convention obama does nothing constructive on either count
8091653 lo normal es que el equipo juegue mejor mucho mejor de lo que lo hizo en la ida
8091654 est mucho mejor de su lesi n en el b ceps femoral
8091655 estoy bien y puedo jugar quiero hacerlo y mantengo el reto de jugar la final de la champions con el arsenal el pr ximo mes de mayo
8091656 quiero dar las gracias por este nuevo impulso que le dieron a nuestro equipo y esperamos que al finalizar la vuelta est n por lo menos tan satisfechos como el a o pasado
8091657 llegamos con el list n bastante alto por los resultados obtenidos durante esta temporada pero vamos a intentar superar lo que hicimos en nuestra primera intervenci n
8091658 i dont think i can make it to the end
8091659 i can cover your back as long as i can
8091660 its a lot but ive been doing it for seven years ill stay as long as im not bored and as long as they want me or im not too old
8091661 some didnt want to do it again the producers wanted contestants who would provide the best story content
8091662 bunky hes very sweet and entertaining and funny but the audience didnt vote him in
8091663 never not for a day my privacy is too important to me
8091664 yeah but when you get back to your apartment you do have privacy theres no escape in that house
8091665 before the series started i went in and i wasnt familiar with the concept it was little eerie a little disturbing now its like oh its cool we got a new house last year we just made some renovations for this year we dont want to make it totally comfortable we have to have some tension in the house people are at their wits end
8091666 four girls could sleep in it theyre different than guys they can have a slumber party and share a big bed
8091667 i didnt but then my director from the early show will say oh my god these people are crazy youve got to get in here and check this out ill have the feed on when im getting ready for the show i catch myself watching it but i can understand why people waste hours during the day not doing their work
8091668 i only meet them when they get evicted thats the first time
8091669 i havent predicted a single one its not always the strongest person who wins sometimes its someone who flies under the radar it depends on the chemistry of the group what works from one season may not work with the group dynamic from another season
8091670 i was working at cbs in the news department and i knew live television they wanted someone from within someone who could do live interviews they approached me and offered it to me
8091671 the first season was full of curveballs i was told the contestants wanted to revolt and walk out on me on the live show i was like oh no but they didnt do it
8091672 if i go home this week i will be fine because i get to go home to sarah
8091673 online interest in cbs big brother continues to grow according to online researcher hitwise while fox continues to place the most shows in the top 10 list of broadcast tv show web sites with the most traffic
8091674 big brother 8 is kinda like crack minus the harrowing come downs and constant scratching thats why we love to hate it and hate to love it
8091675 one person on board the aircraft died and three were wounded during the incident
8091676 de ellas tres ser n minic maras y otras dos superlentas es un dispositivo muy superior al que exige la uefa para los partidos de la primera fase de esta competici n establece un m nimo de 13 para cuartos y de 16 para semifinales el despliegue incluye tambi n el traslado al vicente calder n de una gr a y una minigr a
8091677 se har un seguimiento especial a ag ero uno de los jugadores que pueden ser clave en este partido que viene de ganar la medalla de oro con argentina y al p blico del calder n queremos mostrar con detalles la evoluci n de los aficionados del atl tico durante el partido
8091678 cuando llevas tanto tiempo en el mismo lugar entras en una monoton a y necesitaba un cambio y encontrar un reto que sea positivo
8091679 un equipo te ofrece tres a os seg n como est el f tbol ahora mismo y es una gran oferta porque sabes que es futuro para uno
8091680 llevaba mucho tiempo lejos de mi casa y ahora estar a menos de tres horas me apetec a mucho
8091681 el rayo es un equipo con historia y cae bien a todo el mundo
8091682 acabamos de subir de segunda b y lo primero es asentarnos en la categor a aunque el nivel que he visto en el equipo es muy bueno
8091683 el m ster lo va a tener muy complicado para elegir a los que jueguen pero eso es muy bueno para el equipo porque hay muchas alternativas
8091684 nunca lo he hecho no me importan los objetivos individuales prima el grupo por encima de todo
8091685 you may remember amy oullette from the cbs reality show big brother 3 oulllette known on the show as amy crews was the first person in the history of big brother to get voted off the show and then get voted back on
8091686 i auditioned for big brother 3 as a joke i never intended to get on the show
8091687 they asked me a lot of questions and i said a lot of mean things about some of the current house guests so im sure im going to look like a very horrible person
8091688 i wish they would ask me to come back on the show it would be so much fun
8091689 me gusta el alav s y empiezo de cero del todo
8091690 voy a poner muchas ganas e ilusi n durante mi estancia en vitoria para jugar con el alav s espero que todo salga bien en esta temporada porque es algo que todos queremos
8091691 en esta nueva etapa empiezo de cero tras romper con todo lo anterior seguir con mi carrera en un club nuevo y que siempre me ha gustado mucho como es el alav s
8091692 no habr ni privilegios ni marginaciones que no ayudan en nada a lo que debe ser la selecci n
8091693 okay i obviously only love the underdogs in the world because i loved janelle last year just like i loved stephenie the first time in palau but just like steph in gautemala i hate janelle on all stars
8091694 so this is the last houseguest to be evicted that wont be on the jury this season my thoughts are see you soon jase hhahahahahhahahah
8091695 the networks dont have a huge summer hit this year
8091696 i really thought there was a good chance we could be friends
8091697 she decided to make things personal there were things outside of the game that hurt me inside of the game
8091698 big brother 6 season she spoke out about it in a 2006 interview and that is the reason janelle targeted her
8091699 she talked a lot of bad things about me on her season and i found out she wanted to apologize but it wasnt sincere at all i said that every time it comes up it sours me out a little she decided that was the reason she should put me up
8091700 i think jase thought it existed and i knew nothing about it
8091701 i was never asked about it i would have liked to have been part of it
8091702 i want that karma boomerang to come around and knock janelle out of the game
8091703 bb6 alliance member didnt win the head of household competition were gonna have to have a talk but first lets see what most recent evictee diane had to say about you
8091704 at end of the day obamas our brother worthy of our criticism our love and our support just like malcolm and martin
8091705 the modern uranium mining industry is a safe process its a well managed process and its well understood and theres a lot of understanding of the environment and the management that goes into it
8091706 arnold shapiro executive producer of the cbs show big brother together with allison grodner and rich meehan took time out of his busy schedule to answer a few questions for me
8091707 just some guy down the hall who we grabbed for the shot
8091708 its hard to find a direction in the absence of marketmoving factors and given the thin trade the market has beenpulled down by gravity
8091709 the impact of the credit crisis on the real estateenvironment and markets everywhere has been unprecedented inrecent history and global operating conditions remainextremely challenging
8091710 westfield was a reasonable result but it is going to comeunder pressure because of the u s economy
8091711 the impact of the credit crisis on the real estateenvironment and markets everywhere has been unprecedented inrecent history and global operating conditions remainextremely challenging
8091712 westfield was a reasonable result but it is going to comeunder pressure because of the u s economy
8091713 it appears to be an internal software processing problem were going to have to do some forensics on it
8091714 its difficult to predict what will happen next but thereare high risks for violence lying ahead investors will waitand see what the governments move will be
8091715 an interative web site on the human brain and behavior
8091716 i cant refute the ugly truth about niggers so ill hurl

8091737 hillary doesnt sing well you dont want her to sing
8091738 these are the same folks who say they believe in small government and fiscal restraint but are responsible for the biggest runup of the federal deficit in history
8091739 this is a good price given consideration for the current softening in oil prices the turbulence on global stock markets and the geopolitical stage

8091763 remember the time when we were in the bb house and
8091764 in a night when the total rating score for the big four networks was just a 7 5 a family guy rerun got the best diagnosis of any show in prime with a 2 7 rating 8 share in the key 18 49 demographic at 9 fox eked out a first place finish with a 2 0 6
8091765 i ate it for a meal we all did around here before it got to them
8091766 so i can only imagine it after eating it for a week
8091767 it had to be tasteless and colorless its really bland but because its got protein its got a bit of an aluminum taste
8091768 chicken george has been in there whipping up quite a few different items hes been deep frying it making it into crackers and biscuits hes trying hes trying hard
8091769 bb3 said the only way to make it edible is to burn it
8091770 its a very significant concern and caused an immediate mobilization by the hawaii department of agriculture sent people over to survey within a 5 mile radius trying to eliminate all bees within 5 miles to try to stop it from spreading any further
8091771 its a chemical that helps workers find worker bees attract other workers to a suitable spot so we do put these scents on the traps as well as other things they like such as honey or wax
8091772 he was soliciting johns that way forcing her to go and have sex with these johns and then collecting the money that she receives
8091773 the alliance of janelle kaysar james and howie continued to dominate big brother all stars tonight as the foursome from the shows sixth season went after a
8091774 oh theyre going to wake us up every 15 minutes
8091775 when i found out there was stuff to eat i wanted it so so bad
8091776 what have we been watching or not watching as we turn the calendar page today and head into the unofficial last month of summer
8091777 whas11s commitment to breaking news and severe weather wins july sweeps
8091778 george boswell of rockford appeared safe sunday night after janelle went after erika and mike on big brother 7 all stars
8091779 the staff at realivision made no secret of the fact that one of our favourites going into big brother all stars was nakomis and she was even before our first interview with her
8091780 teehee yeah yeah i think i can deal with having another kick ass summer in ny if i have to
8091781 thats what we love about you babe youll always be okay
8091782 theres only one thing people respond to more than pressure in big brother and thats charisma
8091783 por supuesto que estoy cansado pero soy el n mero uno del mundo y en el us open hay que jugar a tope y con mi mejor tenis
8091784 creo que le ayud con mi juego para que resistiera tanto jug bien pero yo no trabaj con mi intensidad habitual y la que he tenido durante estos ltimos dos meses
8091785 hay que ir paso a paso partido a partido y en mi mente no est la final todav a y un nuevo encuentro con roger federer mi objetivo no es vencerle nuevamente sino ganar el us open
8091786 the key to a safe future is not in business or social prosperity
8091787 the house of representatives could if it chose find reasonable grounds to bring articles of impeachment
8091788 in order to get elected president of the united states the american public is going to demand that both a democrat as well as a republican nominee that he shed or she shed that authority
8091789 we can assure you we wont have another dick cheney in joe biden
8091790 obama biden are committed to respecting the system of checks and balances enshrined in our constitution and are committed to setting a new direction for this country unlike john mccain who wants to continue the same failed policies of the last eight years
8091791 calmly give a detailed point by point description of the assailant and his vehicle
8091792 hei kamu seenaknya menahan adik saya dan tidak mengizinkan masuk saya ini letnan kolonel dari mabes polri awas yach kamu nanti saya kasih pelajaran
8091793 maaf pak bapak letnan kolonel dari mabes polri saya tidak takut kalau bapak berani datang ke kantor
8091794 maaf pak kalau bapak letkol kenapa bicara tidak sopan kalau berani datang ke kantor saja jelas petugas

8091797 that bird is so smart george has taught him over 200 words
8091798 but you do realize dont you that hes just saying the words he doesnt really understand what they mean
8091799 are people that choose to have a child via donor conception being selfish because of the possible implications for that child

8091804 big brother 5 and discussed pursuing an acting career but this time around hes happy to be returning home
8091805 in survivor if you win food or do good in the competition thats a good thing here they resent it
8091806 ultimately the money its not fun but its not a bad gig even if you dont win its not a bad thing at all
8091807 that was one of the best moments of the season
8091808 if you make me cry again so help me ill kick your
8091809 and the eviction goes to jase was all smiles and full of thanks when james didnt nominate him instead putting
8091810 i cant find an individual to hate because i hate you all

8091817 it is so weird it is like i am sad but yet jealous
8091818 now i am going to push a buzzer and hope it says alison where is my life heading christ

8091829 personally i dont have the guts to follow jesus so i often settle for being a christian
8091830 ive done everything the bible says even the stuff that contradicts the other stuff
8091831 weve been having such a blast its a dream come true none of us in sixx a m expected to have such an amazing response from the audiences were going on pretty early we go on at ten to six in the evening so we didnt know what to expect we certainly didnt expect to have the place almost at capacity by the time our set was done people have showed up real early to see sixx a m and hear us play these songs thats something that has thrilled all of us we never expected to even be out on the road playing this stuff at all so everything since the day we finished the record has been icing on the cake to have the biggest rock song of the year life is beautiful and have people show up in droves to check us out has been so rewarding
8091832 i got into this business in the first place wanting to be a rock star when i was young i moved out to l a and did all of the things that a wannabe rock star does it wasnt until i got my first record deal went out and worked my first solo record that i really came to the heartfelt conclusion that i was more cut out to be a behind the scenes guy i enjoyed going out touring and working my record but i got so much more enjoyment out of producing and writing for other artists the social side of that was so enjoyable for me and it was much less grueling than having to be out on the road several years ago i made the decision to not be an artist it had to take something like this two of my closest friends nikki sixx and dj ashba and a really exciting record to get me out of the studio and on stage im so grateful that i am because im having the time of my life
8091833 with subject matter like the heroin diaries soundtrack the obvious thing is to do a bunch of story videos lets tell the story again within the video what we didnt want to do is paint too specific a story for any one of these songs so either we go for the abstract like we did on the life is beautiful video or we show something like what its like to be out on the road with sixx a m a new band cutting its teeth in front of a lot of people were excited about everything thats going on and we wanted to share that experience with people especially those that werent able to make it to cr e fest this summer
8091834 again we didnt know what was going to happen with sixx a m in fact when we recorded the heroin diaries soundtrack there was no sixx a m we became a band after the demand was there for it and life is beautiful started doing so well were in a constant state of readjusting our expectations and our plans were at the stage now where were starting to write songs again and talk about concepts obviously with this first record we had the book the heroin diaries to build everything off of now we have a clean slate and thats thrilling to us to have a blank canvas to work from its too early to be specific about what this record will be about but what i can tell you is once again it will be the three of us pushing ourselves and challenging ourselves to do something that we end up being in love with
8091835 its going to be very similar to the way the first one was done in that well piece it together when time allows nikki will be very busy with m tley cr e im scoring a film as soon as i get back to l a and ill be producing other bands it will be done when its right for the three of us thats why its so hard to give a window of time but the one thing i can say is when we put our minds to something we get it done pretty quick one could safely assume theyll see another sixx a m record sometime early next year

8091852 security forces under the protection of the questionable armed forces special powers act afpsa have run riot against the muslims of the valley while same forces act as mute spectators in the face of continuing defiance of curfew in jammu
8091853 so far we have not enforced the economic blockade of kashmir valley if police doesnt stop from taking action against us we will strangulate kashmiris no matter even if this will mean opening of the srinagar muzaffarabad road
8091854 the massive and peaceful peoples protest which is continuing in the jammu region is not only unique but unparalleled in the history of democratic movements in the country
8091855 entire world is witness to the fact that kashmir movement is purely indigenous peaceful and it was intensified by the economic blockade of the valley
8091856 mass gathering of millions of people at eidgah and elsewhere proved that people of kashmir will settle for nothing less than freedom
8091857 curbing media is a deplorable act beating media men was a part of pressure tactics applied to stop media from reporting the present situation
8091858 entire world knows that people of kashmir have launched a peaceful movement they government are telling blatant lies in order to crush the present movement
8091859 small kids are starving for want of milk and the sick and indisposed cant get any medicines posing danger to their lives
8091860 ironically the instruments of the state have failed to show the same tolerance and restrain in kashmir as was done in jammu
8091861 while the protesters indulging in arson looting and communal attacks in jammu are dealt with enormous caution bullets are brutally being showered on peaceful and unarmed protesters in kashmir
8091862 it seems that some vested interests both within and outside the administration want the vicious cycle of violence to continue in the valley as they are continuously adding fuel to the fire by spraying bullets on the peaceful protesters

8092025 many others are actually angry he has basically turned his back on the democratic party
8092026 a vote for lamont would jeopardize our chances for getting a democrat in the white house in 2008

8092032 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
8092033 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
8092034 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
8092035 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
8092036 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
8092037 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
8092038 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
8092039 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
8092040 we should be working with law enforcement right now to make sure that we protect people against people who are not capable of knowing what to do with a gun because theyre either mentally imbalanced and or because they have a criminal record
8092041 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
8092042 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
8092043 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
8092044 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
8092045 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
8092046 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
8092047 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
8092048 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
8092049 well let you know if we can use your services
8092050 but unlike a lot of people in product marketing those days who would go out and do customer testing asking people what they wanted steve didnt believe in that he said how can i possibly ask someone what a graphics based computer ought to be when they have no idea what a graphics based computer is no one has ever seen one before

8092060 ive cried ive laughed i broke out in hives ive gone through the whole gamut of emotions
8092061 a really important aspect of it is our ability to really be able to quantify what the benefit is
8092062 the green meter capability coupled with what we can already compute in terms of miles that would otherwise be traveled or gas expenditures that are associated with people going to these meetings as well as productivity loss with those travel hours is significant
8092063 green meter detects through the ip internet protocol locations of all those attendees who would travel to the host and through a series of complex algorithms is able to measure and provide metrics of what the carbon emission output would be from the trip as well as the fuel costs and fuel amounts associated with that trip
8092064 we first launched green meter a little over a year ago and since then across ilincs customers were going to save almost 2 billion pounds of carbon emissions this year
8092065 we err on the side of being extremely conservative because the numbers are so good
8092066 based on the distance of those flights it can determine the size of the jet that youd be taking
8092067 its very intuitive because of what our developers have built into it
8092068 the idea for this came from the governor janet napolitano herself who cast her efficiency review steering committee which is composed of senior staff in her office to basically go out and look for strategies that would help benefit the environment reduce travel and provide another basket of benefits that are associated with this kind of technology for web conferencing
8092069 we have end to end aes advanced encryption standard encryption that is the highest government level you can get
8092070 so that means everything that is leaving my computer right now gets encrypted and then it doesnt get unencrypted until it hits your computer
8092071 i think that in these times of tight budgets and increased sensitivity to the environment that web conferencing when done correctly can really provide a strong benefit for state and local governments
8092072 yes ever hear of having the extra time and money to fuss over repairs that dont exactly seem necessary as long as the darn thing runs no thats funny me either

8092076 second as others have pointed out mccain is perilously close to turning his pow record into a punchline
8092077 like so many john mccain served our country bravely and suffered for years as a pow for that he deserves our thanks and respect and we have paid and continue to pay him that respect but having been a pow is not an excuse for a litany of bad votes in the senate and wrong positions as a candidate having been a pow is not an excuse for voting against veterans benefits or an excuse for supporting president bushs tax cuts for the wealthy or an excuse for supporting the use of torture john mccain was a brave soldier but he cannot hide behind that experience and use it as an excuse for every bad decision hes made since hes being anything but brave as a senator and as a candidate he should continue to use that bravery to try to defend those positions if he truly believes in them he should not hide behind his war experiences thats the opposite of bravery if they can figure out an artful term for it call him a damn wimp
8092078 we had to sit around in the dirt and eat if we were lucky

8092081 increased atmospheric carbon has a warming effect on the earth
8092082 while the scope and long term consequences of this warming effect are the subject of ongoing research we believe the united states should take measured and reasonable steps today
8092083 there are a lot of people who are afraid of me in the game
8092084 i think that he made a horrible mistake leaving will and boogie in the house just because they are really good manipulators one of them shouldve been out here right now
8092085 all would be well with the republic if only these loathesome left liberal democrats would stop destroying the democratic party i once admired and might even have joined
8092086 flamers tell themselves their enemies are so vicious they have to be vicious too
8092087 the democrats are in danger of doing to obama what they did to their last two nominees gore and kerry burying authentic individuals under a layer of prefab themes
8092088 immense is the army of michelangelos trying to sculpture the melted marshmallow of kerrys core and tumultuous is the cry of the strategists and loud are the furies of the campaign but in the center there is a silence for in the beginning all was vacuum and a void
8092089 shut them out he turned his back on the universe of geniuses and stayed true to his core identity at the core obamas best message has always been this he is unconnected with the tired old fights that constrict our politics he is in tune with a new era he is authentically the sort of person who emerges in a multicultural globalized age he is therefore naturally in step with the problems that will confront us in the years to come
8092090 is the most split personality politician in the country today on the one hand there is dr barack the high minded niebuhr quoting speechifier who spent this past winter thrilling the scarlett johansson set and feeling the fierce urgency of now but then on the other side theres fast eddie obama the promise breaking tough minded chicago pol whod throw you under the truck for votes
8092091 unconnected with the tired old fights that constrict our politics
8092092 and when democrats are nervous all the santa monica machiavellis emerge from their fund raisers offering words of wisdom and the subtext of the advice being offered this year is that barack obama should really be someone else
8092093 so long was the line of approaching volvos that it was visible from outer space yet still the message was not honed king kerry still did equivocate hedge and reverse of flip flops there were more than a few he still did velcro his principles upon the cathedral door and change them by the hour
8092094 on the one hand obama did sell out the primary cause of his professional life all for a tiny political advantage if hell sell that out what wont he sell out on the other hand global affairs aint beanbag if were going to have a president who is going to go toe to toe with the likes of vladimir putin maybe it is better that he should have a ruthlessly opportunist fast eddie obama lurking inside
8092095 ill put a plus down every time a speaker says that mccain is a good man who happens to be out of step with the times ill put a plus down every time a speaker says that a multipolar world demands a softer international touch ill put a plus down when a speaker says the old free market policies worked fine in the 20th century but no longer seem to be working today these are arguments that reinforce obamas identity as a 21st century man
8092096 oftentimes one brings in celebrity for a sense of making a campaign look like its young and vibrant and visionary and all the rest of it you give it a bit of that showbiz juice the problem is that the last thing that barack obama needs is showbiz juice
8092097 hes got all the charisma hes got the speaking the whole idea of this rock star candidate is now to some extent being reframed to become a liability the democratic party has to be really careful that they dont paint themselves as a hollywood presidency kind of thing
8092098 a lot of people are beginning to realize that celebrity endorsements are doing a lot more to get you to change your mind about the celebrity than they do to get you to change your mind about a candidate
8092099 most people come to candidates with pretty set ideas of what their party is and who they like and who they dont
8092100 just because one of their favourite actors endorses someone or speaks for one of them i think its more likely that the average voter is going to say oh i used to like that celebrity but they like candidate x so i dont like that celebrity anymore
8092101 if the youth vote turns out as it did with the primaries for obama i think youre going to see a president obama
8092102 if the youth vote does as it has done in the past and that is that it always promises and looks like its going to be behind john kerry or al gore then what youre going to see is president mccain
8092103 i think it cuts both ways the candidates want celebrities there because it brings media attention but they dont want them around too much because they dont want to bring negative attention as though it is just a celebrity kind of endorsement
8092104 depending on the celebrity you might be able to register three votes but you might lose three votes there are people in hollywood who are very divisive in terms of their politics
8092105 the celebrities use it as a means of getting themselves back into the limelight
8092106 its what i would call a synergistic relationship where both sides probably benefit in a celebrity spectacle culture

8092117 it is my complete intention to be governor through january of 2010 and i see no circumstance under which thats not going to happen
8092118 im sure tim kaine enjoyed the attention he received as barack obamas surrogate attending rallies traveling the country going on the sunday morning talk shows and being showered in confetti at each stop
8092119 but tim kaine will not be vice president this year and he must now set aside his ambitions to focus on getting back to work as governor particularly now given the budget mess we find ourselves in likely a billion dollars in the red
8092120 it does make me more engaged in the november race because weve got to have a partner in washington that understands how to manage an economy
8092121 i think hes made a great pick with joe biden
8092122 it has been surreal in kind of a beyond your wildest dreams way to be mentioned

8092167 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
8092168 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
8092169 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
8092170 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
8092171 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
8092172 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
8092173 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
8092174 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
8092175 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
8092176 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
8092177 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
8092178 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
8092179 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
8092180 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
8092181 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
8092182 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
8092183 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
8092184 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction

8092228 la literatura sirve para cruzar puentes y vernos como naciones el desaf o es educar a los ni os en el placer de leer
8092229 c mo podremos restaurar a adi m s adelante el surgimiento de escritores en el caribe debemos inspirar a la juventud para que desde ella se desarrollen poetas y escritores nuevos es la nica manera
8092230 it is all too easy to find the 100 women who will protest at the convention and they become the story
8092231 rather than to talk about the underlying numbers of women voters who in droves will vote for obama
8092232 people dont know yet that john mccain is just bad for women
8092233 talking about these differences is clearly a pathway to generating intensity among women voters
8092234 these swing women voters have tremendous economic anxiety right now
8092235 women are going to the watercooler and talking about what just happened in georgia
8092236 they are not unmindful of the way the world impacts on them

8092238 la presencia de la casa en carifesta es fundamental pues este es un festival que se concentra mucho en los pa ses de habla inglesa pero al hablar del caribe es preciso reconocer tambi n a aquellos pa ses de habla hispana francesa holandesa en ese sentido la casa de las am ricas ha tenido siempre una vocaci n regional de unidad de respeto por todos los pa ses de la comunidad es una instituci n que los ha visibilizado a todos
8092239 hasta ahora carifesta ha estado muy bien siempre he dicho que las ediciones de este festival no deber an espaciarse tanto pues desde sus jornadas el caribe emerge con mucha fuerza pero luego que el evento termina lo caribe o vuelve a caer nuevamente en el olvido
8092240 es un gran placer para m estar en guyana por segunda vez como cubana hablo espa ol y creo que es mi derecho y tambi n mi deber al menos comenzar esta lectura en espa ol as ustedes sentir n el sonido del idioma despu s seguimos en ingl s
8092241 in his utter arrogance dustin erikstrup forgot the first rule of big brother you never ever volunteer to be nominated dustins decision to do so earlier this week will undoubtedly go down as one of the stupidest strategic mistakes ever made on the cbs reality show series and it cost him the game
8092242 well theyre obviously celebrating like its new years eve over at cbs this seasons most notorious player has survived like a roach post armageddon guaranteeing at least one more week of fairly good ratings for big brother if not an incredible surge in page views on the ad supported cbs com i like you am starting to think somethings up with dicks obviously unemployed son vincent and how hes rumored to be using some sort of auto voter to help his pathetic pa achieve the dubious online title of most favorite player good god im speechless
8092243 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
8092244 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course
8092245 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down
8092246 i think hes more ready for it clearly by far than i was
8092247 they shot themselves in the foot with the four camera
8092248 weve looked at several ways to play anticipated growth in wind energy weve also considered titanium makers for that industrys ties to the production of lightweight modern aircraft
8092249 while the two trends might not appear to have much in common at first glance hxl offers a way to play both the aircraft and wind markets
8092250 the connection is the lightweight composite materials hexcel makes that are used by producers in both sectors hexcel develops and manufactures advanced structural materials
8092251 it is the largest u s producer of carbon fiber the worlds largest weaver of reinforcement fabrics and the number one producer of composite materials
8092252 its product was initially developed for the aerospace industry but is now used in a wide range of applications from golf clubs to satellite arrays and from the rotor blades of wind turbines to life saving monocoques for formula 1 race cars
8092253 its been a rollercoaster ride for hexcels stock in the past 12 months the shares hit their one year peak of 27 19 in december 2007 by january 22nd they had plummeted to 17 the shares rebounded through may only to fade again year to date hxl is off about 15
8092254 second quarter profits came in shy of wall streets expectations as a result of costs associated with the start up of four overseas manufacturing plants and a weak u s dollar the reason hexcel has been investing in plants in europe is to be closer to customers such as airbus
8092255 hexcel just won a big order from airbus that was the biggest in the companys history
8092256 hexcel is in a great position to profit from the growing investment in wind energy platforms and the demand for lighter weight more fuel efficient airplanes the skyrocketing price of crude during q2 did much to disrupt the plans of cash strapped airlines to acquire the new planes
8092257 boeings delays getting the dreamliner in the air have also been well documented those are short term problems however long term it is inevitable that air carriers will want these newer planes in their fleets
8092258 wind energy is obviously a hot topic too oilman boone pickens is pushing wind farms as an alternative to oil fired power plants al gores alliance for climate protection meanwhile has promoted them as an anecdote to greenhouse gas emissions
8092259 when two guys like gore and pickens coming from opposite ends of the political spectrum can come to the same view theres some karma happening
8092260 a strong dollar should help hexcels cost structure in its overseas plants and could well lead to an earnings surprise in the second half of the year if the trend continues this is a stock to keep on our radar
8092261 in the process of expanding in europe germany is one of several possible future markets
8092262 we receive inquiries from all over the world there is enormous interest in current
8092263 according to our observations germany is a market that could soon be ripe for current
8092264 tv and the web amount to the same thing to us
8092265 unlike most broadcasters we do not only use television to attract people to the internet on the contrary people go to current com swap thoughts concerns and videos and then we bring the best of it to the tv screen
8092266 yes janelle talked mad smack about diane in the house
8092267 and the eviction goes to alisons very first attempt to stir things up backfired
8092268 im going to pull her out by her fake hair and her fake boobs and drown her in the pool
8092269 if dr will were a woman id kind of be attracted to him
8092270 im going to get on howies back and just ride him like seabiscuit right into the season six alliance
8092271 everyone knows danielle will stick a blade in you cut you open eat your heart crap it out and give it back to you
8092272 hes like upstairs looking for the diary room hes outside looking for the toilet at one point hes in the refrigerator looking for the golden power of veto
8092273 were not a public utility were a newspaper and we cover things based on what is newsworthy people who have half a percent or less following among the public are much less newsworthy than people with 40 and 50 percent
8092274 the nader campaign is based on a simple premise there is no difference between the two major parties
8092275 this is true if you stand far enough away from the two parties in the same way new york and tokyo would look similar if you were standing on the moon
8092276 a self indulgent exercise that that will distract voters from the clear cut choice represented by the major party candidates
8092277 the public deserves to see the major party candidates compete on an uncluttered playing field
8092278 protectionism would destroy our prosperity and make the worlds poor even more miserable it is a strange platform for the ralph nader who says he speaks for the weak and the neglected
8092279 many of those who are thinking about voting for mr nader probably imagine that he is still the moderate humane activist of the 1960s
8092280 any presidential candidate whose running mate is winona laduke an ojibway indian activist from a minnesota reservation must be considered both marginal and self indulgent
8092281 like an enormous zit on prom night when least expected or desired nader and his green party followers have reappeared on the political scene
8092282 one of the saddest sights in politics is a fading public figure who refuses to concede that his or her time has passed
8092283 the latest egotist to ignore reality is ralph nader the aging consumer advocate whose crusades stalled and popularity sagged long ago nader is in the great tradition of political diehards who stubbornly hope against hope that they can keep the reporters and speaking fees coming despite all the derisive laughter
8092284 the two party system works fine if not perfectly why cant we leave it at that
8092285 why does it always snow when im going to talk about global warming
8092286 sydneys largest dam warragamba has received 43mm of rain since thursday while the regions smaller dams got a better soaking including the upper nepean which got 108mm
8092287 the water problem is so severe for adelaide that it may run out of water by early 2009
8092288 environmentalists can have a sense of humour too environmentalists can have a sense of humour too
8092289 cbs and apple have just made added big brother all stars the seventh season of the reality show available in the itunes music store
8092290 cellphone is the best way to make television interactive because you can participate without getting out of the couch
8092291 we closed some deals but i dont think anybody knows yet how much of what we do is going to be part of the tv upfront
8092292 we are not used to having an upfront for the internet
8092293 were having a great year our advertising revenue on all our platforms was substantially higher than a year ago
8092294 the granddaddy of summer reality shows is really starting to gray
8092295 the stakes of this election will be made very clear
8092296 the ipcc is a scientific intergovernmental body set up by the world meteorological organization and by the united nations environment programme
8092297 the governments the ipcc is open to all member countries of wmo and unep governments of participate in plenary sessions of the ipcc where main decisions about the ipcc workprogramme are taken and reports are accepted adopted and approved they also participate the review of ipcc reports
8092298 leaving my television on all day and night so i can increase my global footprint
8092299 i learned this shes stronger and tougher that he bill clinton is when she takes a point youre gonna have to be sure youre well informed because she will not compromise shes very bright shes strong and when she gets her dander up she aint going to roll over
8092300 im convinced he has a sexual addiction he needs to get help for his sake he has already damaged his presidency beyond repair
8092301 when truman boarded a train january 1953 at union station without a penny in federal largesse except a microscopic army pension the president knew he would have to sell some property and would even have to dip into his own pocket to buy stamps to answer the 72 000 pieces of mail he received in just the first two weeks after he left the white house
8092302 he assured me the press stories concerning the kickbacks he got in exchange for state contracts were not true he lied to me
8092303 boy is she bitter about the press if george w loses shes gonna pop off the bush press bashing didnt abate even after their boy became president
8092304 i dont know what powell is going to do but if he were to jump into the political arena as a republican he could get the nomination as vice president if not the presidential nomination and he could beat clinton easily
8092305 john mccain would be stronger against gore gore will be a dull unspiring loser candidate for the democrats mccain looks stronger he is stronger mccain because of his military service and vietnam prisoner of war hero status you know he had a hehluva military record
8092306 bush has that air reserve texas national guard record of course gores war record in vietnam aint much either
8092307 timeslot debut draws a weak 2 1 in 18 49s
8092308 for those of you hooked to big brother all stars and i know there are fans out there a name circling the fan forums lately wasnt one you might have expected to hear
8092309 she didnt talk to me but i did set up the phone call
8092310 the last thing i wanted to do was hurt or screw over jase or nakomis i had fun at the auditions for kill reality with jase ive never met nakomis but shes a smart player and a nice person i want dianes head on a platter shes going to talk all kind of shit about me and im not going to get the chance to rebut any of it at all i made a phone call just one phone call my loyalities lie to my real friends like erika and james but i specifically wanted to get the one person who scared the hell out of diane in general and thats janelle
8092311 alison irwin earned a reputation as a backstabbing flirt during her stint on cbs big brother 4 so it isnt all that surprising that her attempts at scheming with danielle in a failed plan to oust janelle caused her to be the first booted out the front door of big brother 7 all stars tuesdays thursdays and sundays at 8 pm et
8092312 ok thats something i could have handled three years ago when i just got out of college but i dont know if now in my life im going to be ready for it and up to my devious stuff that i was up to before
8092313 oh but it can be just dont get on my bad side
8092314 if it makes me a half million dollars ill let howie touch my boobs
8092315 hey it is three months and it is a lot of money whatever happens happens
8092316 you are the most gorgeous woman i have ever seen in my life
8092317 hey janelle wants to put you up and i dont but we have to agree on something
8092318 abc reality contest pulls a 1 2 in 18 49s
8092319 first of all let me say the live feed is the devil
8092320 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
8092321 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
8092322 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
8092323 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
8092324 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
8092325 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
8092326 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
8092327 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
8092328 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
8092329 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
8092330 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
8092331 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
8092332 and in the race to stop global warming hes a friend of our planet too
8092333 john kerrys been fighting for thirty five years to protect our environment
8092334 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on

8092336 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
8092337 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
8092338 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
8092339 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
8092340 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
8092341 shook his fist in wrath as he walked the platform a white foam gathered upon his lips giving him a look of ferocity
8092342 does mr lincoln wish to push these things to the point of personal difficulties here douglas demanded backing around and shaking his clenched fist within a few inches of lincolns face
8092343 made him look like humpty dumpty in a toupee while lincolns height was largely in his legs and gave audiences the impression of a scarecrow come to life
8092344 this government was made by our fathers on the white basis
8092345 by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever
8092346 when lincoln rose to take the oath and discovered that he had no place to rest his top hat douglas obligingly stepped forward and held it for him
8092347 a sad heart with a grief that i have never before experienced
8092348 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
8092349 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
8092350 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
8092351 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
8092352 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
8092353 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
8092354 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
8092355 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
8092356 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
8092357 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
8092358 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
8092359 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
8092360 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
8092361 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward
8092362 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
8092363 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
8092364 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
8092365 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
8092366 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
8092367 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
8092368 a nashville based free market think tank and watchdog organization
8092369 its easy i think of a man and i take away reason and accountability
8092370 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
8092371 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
8092372 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
8092373 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
8092374 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
8092375 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
8092376 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
8092377 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
8092378 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
8092379 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
8092380 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
8092381 in 1984 i was very unpopular with the democratic party
8092382 i had committed the unforgivable sin of losing in 1988 there was a little more warmth and this year ive been more or less reconstituted as a positive figure
8092383 i have participated in the last three conventions when we did not have an incumbent president to re elect
8092384 but will now follow the custom established during the past 40 years by other democratic presidents including harry truman who only attended the first convention after he left office
8092385 anyone who believes he is responsible for what bill clinton did in secret at night with a young intern is absolutely stupid and ridiculous carter told georgias delegates
8092386 he cant stand up as frankly as i did and explain it to you but somehow in the american peoples minds he has to convince them of that absolute truth
8092387 before a national tv audience meadville native alison irwin was the first to be voted off of the cbs television show
8092388 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
8092389 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
8092390 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
8092391 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
8092392 im watching the cbs summer reality series big brother and rock star because its too hot to go out
8092393 big brother 4 and one of the most unpopular houseguests ever became the first all star to be evicted on the seventh season of the cbs reality series of the 10 possible votes alison received only two to stay and those were from her alliance mates nakomis and diane
8092394 i think ive lost my evil touch that i had in big brother 4
8092395 it is just different now it is a lot harder now that i am older and in such a stressful situation
8092396 i have grown up and i am totally in love
8092397 it is just the stress and being caught up in the moment and the gameplay i think janelle is a great person and she is a great competitor we would probably be friends outside of the house it is embarrassing to hear i said something like that so i apologize for that completely
8092398 if his strategy is to snore me out of the house its totally working
8092399 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
8092400 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
8092401 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
8092402 eric a contestant on cbs big brother has a video on youtube where he talks about his old job working on the wwe creative team

8092404 first and foremost we aimed to raise money we wanted to draw the town together and get a full range of people there we had teachers lecturers children artists business people and everyone came together in their own way we also wanted to increase the scope of our awareness the evening was an event that the whole town could enjoy not just the university i am ecstatic about everything
8092405 research efforts that involve cooperation between two or more different organizations similarly weaken this hierarchical constraint on thinking outside the box
8092406 it seems quite possible that many talented scientists and engineers have voted with their feet and have left work in corporate labs in favor of work at government labs university labs or smaller firms
8092407 in the united states there is no central plan for innovation and different federal agencies engage in support for new technologies often in direct competition with other agencies the federal government has created a decentralized network of publicly funded laboratories where technologists will have incentives to work with private firms and find ways to turn their discoveries into commercial products
8092408 the enormous gains from the small percentage of winners are more than enough to cover the losses from the others
8092409 ummi sinan gives us a vision where all the world is filled with roses a world made of roses in sufi mystical language the rose is often used as an image of god and the heart god is the true heart of being the rose unfolds in a gentle circling that invites one to yield inward the rose resonates strongly with the gently awakened heart
8092410 the purchase of phase i of crows nest took teamwork and we will call upon our many partners once again to help us preserve this unique tract of land for our future generations
8092411 crows nest has so much to offer visitors whether its learning about the unique natural resources at the site or the role it played in staffords history as well as its links to our nations heritage
8092412 i am thrilled at gov kaines willingness to assist stafford
8092413 perseverance and patience from many of our local regional state and federal partners helped us with the purchase of phase i we have been meeting with all of our partners to obtain support for phase ii and we are optimistic that we can raise those funds

8092417 keep going and well see what hes like in a week
8092418 tomorrow is the first live eviction on cbs for the big brother all stars
8092419 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
8092420 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
8092421 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
8092422 if georges strategy is to snore me out of the house its totally working
8092423 i dont think chicken george is up to par when it comes to athletics
8092424 george appears to be composting george you know youre looking for vetoes disks right
8092425 i stayed in motel rooms where if you touched the curtains theyd fall apart
8092426 me making it here is like a donkey winning the kentucky derby
8092427 last night it looked like the national league would break its long major league baseball all star game losing streak to the american league before the latter rallied to win in the ninth inning
8092428 ts incredible how some people love to criticize and then go and do the same thing
8092429 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
8092430 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
8092431 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
8092432 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
8092433 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
8092434 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
8092435 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
8092436 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
8092437 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
8092438 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
8092439 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
8092440 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you

8092632 used with caution in patients with cardiac failure hypertension impaired renal function peripheral and pulmonary edema and toxemia of pregnancy
8092633 there is no doubt that will mega qualifies as a big brother all star the question is will the show producers and the viewing audience vote him back onto the show after all he set the tone for the following seasons when it came to cut throat competing
8092634 i am fully prepared to compete in this years big brother all star season
8092635 he will mega was the jr ewing of the house when he walks into a room he has a great personality hes charming and hes got a great way with words hes a very good looking guy he was like an early guy in he was one of the first guys everybody said yeah this guy is great he had no criminal record while he was in the house we watched him very carefully and he never expressed any hate or any political message while he was on that show i was happy he was in the house
8092636 more than 2 4 million viewers voted for their faves among the 20 contestants competing to enter the house
8092637 thursday night viewers will find out which contestants were chose to be part of this summers
8092638 yes this is going to be a very hot summer this is going to be the most intense combative extreme
8092639 when julie reads off the names of the winning people im going to be scared im going to be nervous im going to be paranoid im going to be excited
8092640 ill be thinking cmon cbs a lot of people play good stocks
8092641 because every one of these people came in with a strategy that they either used or changed but by the end america and everybody knew what everybodys strategy was
8092642 its all stars its going to be competitive its the best of the best
8092643 the producers have been brilliant in the past with giving us tricks and keeping us guessing and expecting the unexpected
8092644 by tonight what you see here will come to life these will be actual tarantulas different varieties different species of tarantulas
8092645 so at least four people will be sleeping in here theyll have to
8092646 and who knows maybe six people will sleep in there
8092647 big brother 7 all starsnew 8 pm et cbs will it be a summer of hurricane howie or evil dr will or self proclaimed house hooker alison find out tonight when they and the 17 other former bb houseguests vying for fan votes learn which 12 will enter the compound for the all stars competition and which eight are sent home host julie chen delivers the news tim holland
8092648 you may be spending at least some of this summer with
8092649 some were beloved some we loved to hate some we just plain hated but they all made great tv
8092650 the competition will be so fierce that every eviction will be a big deal
8092651 the ones we already know we cant trust the real mind screwers will also be the first to go oh and anyone who is very well liked by the viewers
8092652 that could be like waving a red cloth in front of a bull
8092653 i know im a target especially because the producers have told us that america will have more say this time than ever before
8092654 theyre not going to do bb all stars and not bring in the black gay guy
8092655 i dont care what anybody says i am the most famous person to come out of the franchise i made the biggest blunder in the history of reality tv
8092656 if dr will starts pulling that villain bulls t well get rid of him
8092657 i fully anticipate being the first to get kicked out
8092658 but in my case eviction is the highest form of flattery
8092659 i didnt watch any bb season but my own the more recent contestants are real students of bb and know everybodys tricks im just not that bored or desperate
8092660 julie chen saw it when she took a tour of the house and couldnt sleep that night
8092661 some people went into the game and let lust derail them
8092662 now theyre saying im not going to let physical attraction get in the way
8092663 the best of the best and some of the worst are coming back to our televisions and live feeds this thursday july 6 on cbss big brother all stars
8092664 big house the online polls have spoken on big brother 7 more than 2 4 million viewers voted for their faves among the 20 contestants competing to enter the house tonight host julie chen announces the 12 winners cbs ch at 8
8092665 i tip my hat to anyone who applies and gets into the big brother house because you have no escape
8092666 the big brother producers are turning up the heat with the all stars season debuting tonight on cbs the brain trust behind the summer long reality series is busy planning new and devious ways to keep the returning players on their toes
8092667 the returning houseguests have played this game before and we need to be able to throw some curve balls in i cannot tell you specifically but certainly there will be things throughout the season that will be different and will kick the game up a few notches
8092668 we know how savvy our fans are there wasnt a problem it was actually fun to watch we saw how many votes were being generated by these bots rest assured they did not count
8092669 ultimately there was a specific amount of votes that each ip address could send each day you were allowed to return to the site every day and vote to prevent the hacking and the auto voters from being able to be used the number of votes that were allowed could not be released in order to prevent these extra votes from counting
8092670 we have hand picked these people with americas help to highlight each season in the house so already going into this you can say the competition is stiff it is going to be a clash of the titans we are excited to see the competitive nature of all 20
8092671 we had people we liked that didnt come back because of life decisions we are sad that they didnt but we understand this is a three month commitment that everyone has to make
8092672 i think there is one that is incredibly memorable nicole from season two she did great
8092673 she played hard she came back from nothing at the beginning of the season so as far as all stars i think she deserves to be on that list but for reasons we completely understand she was unable to come back
8092674 no comment on that anything is possible in the big brother house expect the unexpected as always we are starting with 12 as we have been saying and we will see what happens from there
8092675 what i will assure you is that will not happen our game still remains pure to where we started in which the people in the house are responsible for evicting their own
8092676 i come back each year because this is really a lot of fun to do we love this show it is like summer camp
8092677 we are all screaming and cheering behind the scenes it is unlike any other production it is a great group of people it is also fun to keep inventing new ways to work with the houseguests and to make the game better

8092682 por otra parte prosigui la investigadora fue reveladora la presencia de esa multiplicidad de elementos que integran el caribe sobre todo en un territorio como guyana porque solemos decir que en el caribe se ha reunido el mundo pero en guyana esto se evidencia mucho m s por la presencia no solo del componente aborigen sino tambi n del componente africano y del hind
8092683 esta mezcla ha tenido una presencia muy significativa en la ceremonia de apertura que ha sido verdaderamente majestuosa ha estado adem s muy organizada con un p blico altamente participativo y una presencia juvenil muy llamativa lo cual es muy interesante pues garantiza la continuidad de un evento que es sin duda el mega festival de la regi n el de mayor alcance el de mayor dimensi n
8092684 creo declar nancy morej n al caer la noche en georgetown que hay mucho que esperar de este festival que se ha propuesto un gran alcance a la altura de lo que signific carifesta para la vida literaria de la regi n este fue un sue o de importantes escritores como george lamming o samuel selvon y de peque as revistas como la de ian mcdonald que se va a lanzar aqu autores tan ligados a la casa de las am ricas que fueron el nudo entre ese movimiento que naci en 1972 y el actual que es la esencia misma del trabajo de la casa hoy
8092685 un mismo caribe un mismo prop sito nuestra cultura nuestra vida
8092686 estamos ante un programa muy amplio coment yolanda wood con una multiplicidad de tem ticas que abordan las reas del cine de las artes visuales de la m sica de la danza de las artes culinarias de la artesan a del libro de la literatura la impresi n que tengo es que estamos ante un festival de una dimensi n muy importante

8092710 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
8092711 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain

8092734 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
8092735 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
8092736 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
8092737 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true

8092760 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
8092761 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation

8092778 the former big brother star said he is settled with a job and a fiancee in florida
8092779 i remember cbs called me once during that and right away i told them that they ought to take that girl shannon off the show
8092780 but it wouldve been rough were very close if he got on thered be no contact for 12 weeks they say that in the long run things always happen for the best
8092781 unless i wouldve won it wouldve been a pay cut
8092782 and im engaged now and it just didnt make sense to do it

8092787 but people come in every day and ask me about the show its great to meet people and talk about the show its an experience i would have never thought would happen
8092788 the reason why i want to go back is that i got so close to winning the first time
8092789 its like ive got unfinished business to take care of people didnt know who i was then now they do and hopefully i can use that to my advantage
8092790 as of right now im going to play it by ear i know im going to have to play the game differently there might be a possibility i have to stab someone in the back or lie
8092791 but as of right now i may ease my way in there i think there is going to be lots of tension and conflicts i might stand back and just let them fight my first goal is to get in the house and my second goal is to at least make it to the jury round i know there will be some great players in there and ill have to be on top of my game and think outside the box for me to come close to one and two
8092792 who knows she nakomis might want to come back for revenge but its my deep feeling she could be a great player and help me make it to the end i really think theres a great possibility that if we could both go in that we could both run the show
8092793 she knows its a dream of mine its very tough as a family aprils like okay he was gone 82 days and here we go doing this all again but they know i have unfinished business when you make it so close youve got to see if you can wint it this time
8092794 life is short and my motto is to have fun in life
8092795 i had fund the first time and know ill have fund this time i keep saying what a great experience it was because it is even if i dont go into the all stars cast im still a winner

8093053 these additional voters guarantee virginia will be closer than its been before but closing that entire gap in one election is tough to do
8093054 i think theres no doubt that youth are going to turn out at rates higher than in previous elections
8093055 the question is is that turnout going to be so high that it alone affects the outcome of the election im not willing to say that youth will turn out in such a way that they will shape the election
8093056 nobody can bank on the youth vote because the youth vote hasnt been reliable in the past
8093057 i think his candidacy is getting a whole lot of young people to vote but theyre not going to vote for him
8093058 so this age group gives us our greatest pool for new voters
8093059 also this age group is very mobile moving to a new state for a new job thus i am not surprised that they are the lions share of the new voters
8093060 i think it is very close but it will be a massive upset if obama does carry virginia given our history
8093061 it makes it a closer election but it doesnt necessarily get you over the top if youre the democrat
8093062 a lot of people have this misconception that youre invincible
8093063 breakdown is a normal part of the process everybody breaks down at some point
8093064 the number of people who are making complaints about this type of crime is on the rise
8093065 we will never send e mails or call people asking them to respond with personal information
8093066 the idea that you can trust a number you are calling has changed significantly just recently
8093067 inclined to pore over and consider individually every typed word inevitably cutting half of the copy and rearranging the other half
8093068 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
8093069 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
8093070 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
8093071 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
8093072 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
8093073 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
8093074 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
8093075 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
8093076 it is our job as stewards of the river to see to it that we take crabs responsibly from the water
8093077 all we are asking is for is this not to be an all you can eat crab affair
8093078 were going to be relatively well off compared to other states but were going to suffer as the national economy has its challenges
8093079 he will probably propose what is in the best interests of his vice presidential ambitions
8093080 why follow the guidelines it isnt like anything is done if you break them
8093081 the opening of a new retail store and donation center at cosners corner is going to have a positive impact for our citizens in need of a helping hand by providing them with jobs and an affordable location to shop
8093082 i like to think of us as a private business with a social purpose
8093083 we clean four and a half million pounds of laundry a year
8093084 we are a small business and will have to pass the tax along to our customers the county is pricing is out of the market
8093085 what kind of businesswoman would i be to sit in front of these men and cry i mean with tears down my face like a big baby wrote sharon in an e mail to the stafford county sun
8093086 at first i was mad at the four members of the board that voted for the bpol but i realize that i should also be mad at myself for not paying attention to what was going on in our county
8093087 the first thing that i will attempt to do is repeal bpol at the first meeting after the 2009 election
8093088 i know what the loopholes are in this ordinance that will make this easy to overturn but we cant file a lawsuit right now its too early
8093089 if we file one now that will give the four horsemen enough time to fix the loopholes
8093090 during the last elections the fredericksburg regional chamber of commerce didnt want to get involved because they didnt want to upset anybody
8093091 these democrats ran on the promise of passing bpol and now they have given you what
8093092 this is really a gateway project for the area that will have to meet the publics expectations
8093093 i think the terminal design is good and will lead the way in providing needed capacity for general aviation
8093094 send this to 20 people and your wildest dreams will come true if you dont the person you love most will totally die by tomorrow

8093101 im really excited for this opportunity and thankful to my principal for nominating me
8093102 the checks are completed and we are really in a maintenance mode right now as we continue to get new volunteers
8093103 adding more career staff would be tough with the funding issues we are facing right now
8093104 what better way can you fight crime and meet your neighbors at the same time
8093105 its a tactile thing the kids like to get up close and take snapshots of the helicopter its great for families
8093106 he lives in deep water so eureka lets call him deepo
8093107 its garbage somebody has tried to cut and edit and distort the facts into what they want them to be
8093108 the video speaks for itself and is a very good representation of what happened at the july 1 meeting when the tax passed
8093109 you have to realize the board had been in session for over 14 hours by that time and at 3 a m you are not as alert as you are when the session begins
8093110 we believe this is further authority in support of our arguments
8093111 the supreme court is going to have to sort that out
8093112 i think it is safe to say that ted was known nationwide
8093113 and hes an example of how this sport needs to grow people who give of their time and give a sincere effort and dont expect anything in return
8093114 i called him radar oreilly from the tv show because he seemed to know everyone and everything
8093115 ted was the one they went to when things were going wrong and they needed help
8093116 he wanted everyone to be keeping up with the bowling scores
8093117 hed get upset if the league office wasnt leaving scores he wanted people to get recognized
8093118 i know he was proud of what he did at the potomac news
8093119 bowling wishes they had someone like him in every city
8093120 there is no need to boil drinking water or to purchase bottled water
8093121 when my kidneys failed he was the one who said that we would make it this together
8093122 my wife is a warrior supporting my wife and keeping her aggressive in treatment is very important i am very proud of her
8093123 im just glad that i has a very understanding employer at the time that helped me
8093124 even though will is not a dialysis patient he has been one of dpcs most active supporters by continually visiting capitol hill and his wifes treatment facility to keep patients encouraged empowered and involved in their care
8093125 it is for us the living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced
8093126 what strikes me about stafford is there are a number of communities like falmouth and aquia brooke and garrisonville the county itself really struggles for an identity what is the mental picture of stafford when the public thinks of fredericksburg or richmond accurate or not they have a picture in their minds of what those places are
8093127 these roads arent numbers these roads are part of the community
8093128 the tough things are the ones that are not schedules the stuff you cant plan for
8093129 it is our job to maintain the ordinary in extraordinary times said romanello
8093130 our main function is to keep people safe and then provide the basics
8093131 i couldnt have been any prouder of the people i work with
8093132 we always cover for each other when one of us leaves we are pretty much generalists
8093133 the hallmark of the night was an elderly gentleman who stood up to chief rob brown for opening the berea fire station in a choked up voice the gentleman noted that since berea opened he had called 911 three times and berea responded all three times within two minutes
8093134 i wish every county employee could have been there to hear this man thank chief brown none of us serves the public alone
8093135 that is where democracy happens and it its a great to have a front row seat to watch it
8093136 the board is demanding of the county administrator and they should be
8093137 what we try to do is bring people into the organization and share our best values set clear expectations hold people accountable and then get the hell out of the way

8093139 i consider than our current sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us
8093140 an enlightened person is he who recognizes that what he really wants is a drastic change in himself and not a situational change
8093141 we had the oppurtunity to talk to ashleas mom michelle and ask her a few questions about ashlea and janelle
8093142 on the other hand dead caterpillars mean fewer adult moths will be around this summer to lay eggs
8093143 i think we need to recognize this is a very unique situation that a lot of folks and agencies are not comfortable with
8093144 how many hours have you lived in the house from the night you entered until 5pm this evening
8093145 im just not going to talk about my conversations with the campaign
8093146 the only secret meeting i have today while in washington is with my 13 year old daughter
8093147 if this had dragged out any longer we would not have the field for this season
8093148 we spent considerable monies to bring the baseball field up to standard to host district games
8093149 this makes me feel that people really do care about stafford softball and i feel proud
8093150 it just means a lot to finally have a field we can play on
8093151 if somebody says give me a profile of a serial killer we have to say that depends
8093152 it was pretty much driven by the students my interests are kind of boring
8093153 he kind of laughs at it but he does think its a little weird
8093154 i read strictly true crime stuff when i read for pleasure
8093155 our plan right now is to keep adding to the database and make sure its accurate because theres a lot of information were still missing
8093156 it feels like this shouldnt be happening to you you willis have a nice house and you waterholter have your own company
8093157 the university of mary washington is committed to the safety of our students and our neighbors
8093158 we hope that this reward will encourage people with information about the suspect to come forward in the meantime we will continue to do what we can to assist with this investigation
8093159 were making a real effort to reach out to spread the word that we have changed and have products that are more fuel efficient
8093160 also during that time many many people including legislators and advocates have complained about the departments name being unwieldy and far too long
8093161 thus the time for giving this department a new more current name has arrived
8093162 piccadilly tea but i soon learned differently when a friend and i stopped there for lunch
8093163 if youre not a jedi be careful the lightsabre will take your foot off
8093164 we strongly believe there are people in the community who have knowledge of what may have happened and when one or more of them choose to come forward not only will the case move forward but theyll be doing the right thing
8093165 it is a state of mind where one is in doubt and duality prevails there is an internal conflict in every effort or struggle living life in this state of mind we gradually denigrate our true self we must therefore endeavour to rise above this dualistic state of mind to non dualistic thinking this can be achieved by inculcating conviction in our thoughts and unshakable faith in the existence of god once we embrace the will of god in every sphere of life duality comes to an end the root cause of duality is thus eliminated leading to inner peace and bliss
8093166 a little faith will bring your soul to heaven but a lot of faith will bring heaven to your soul
8093167 its energy that this nation needs we can take the proceeds current fossil fuels and put them toward the development of funding new technologies that will produce new sources of energy
8093168 we have had hundreds of people calling across the commonwealth everyday asking for volunteers to help the campaign
8093169 barack obama has been named the most liberal senator in the u s senate that is quite the accomplishment
8093170 preserve america communities demonstrate that they are committed to preservingamericas heritage while ensuring a future filled with opportunities for learning and enjoyment
8093171 this community designation program combined with the preserve america grant program preserve america presidential awards and other federal support provides strong incentives for continued preservation of our cultural and natural heritage resources
8093172 we have so many historical treasures in stafford from the recent discovery of the remains of george washingtons boyhood home at ferry farm to pocahontas living on our shores to government island from which stone was quarried for the white house and the u s capitol and we are committed as a
8093173 the problem is not that people are taxed too little the problem is that government spends too much
8093174 milde also managed to tell supervisor woodson a retired economist from the bureau of labor statistics that he didnt know how to do math
8093175 we are losing money at the level of service we provide now
8093176 its a blessing to have this service here the divers are nice and i have met so many new faces while riding
8093177 i can take a cab from fredericksburg up here for 35 or i can take the bus for a quarter
8093178 if you do the math the bus helps a lot of people out
8093179 anything that you give away for free which is essentially what we are doing by only charging 25 cents people dont put a value on
8093180 i only know of one person in my district who uses the bus on a regular basis and they use it to get to the commuter lot
8093181 taking an urban model like freds and forcing it onto a suburban area is like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole
8093182 fred is in the business of carrying people to work though we dont do long haul commuter busses
8093183 right now the bus is not geared to people in the mornings and fred should expand their focus here in the county and offer commuters better solutions
8093184 we dont want to get our busses down there and get stuck or lose antennas
8093185 we expect to hear from people who are losing their service and we will do our best to accommodate them
8093186 the families expect that virginia tech will make full disclosure so that people presently and future generations can understand in full the circumstances surrounding what is the largest massacre on a campus in u s history
8093187 we really didnt have the resources or time to look at everything involved in this tragedy
8093188 we did try to get the information we needed to arrive at well informed conclusions i think we did that
8093189 we were standing in the hallway with no place to go
8093190 a number of us have been struggling lately with students in the throes of some kind of crisis or mental illness what should we do when a students written texts seem to hint at violence or suicide
8093191 that is not going to be in the report but yall should know people do not learn swiftly
8093192 if we had scripted this entire event we could not have done a better job an unnamed professor made a comment that if we got our participants from central casting we would not have had better players
8093193 seemed to my entire family to go into damage control mode rather than to reach out to those on its staff and faculty most affected by the murders and woundings i know for a fact that president steger himself has never once had a face to face meeting with our daughter in law
8093194 im delighted that i get to be a part of the event its always a lot of fun
8093195 its great to see how creative some of the boat builders are
8093196 aw heck its nearly labour day so lets just call this lovely man the hot science y guy of the summer and be done with it

8093202 i was just curious if you saw the survivor ad that is airing right now claiming that
8093203 so much of the stuff on there was really accurate it was obviously written by somebody with skill

8093221 few reality tv contestants do as well as kaysar ridha from
8093222 my objective was to go in and leave on a good note to leave a positive impression on people
8093223 i didnt go on there to preach i went on there to be myself and it made a difference
8093224 im getting fan mail that says america loves you an iraqi american has captured the hearts of the people and that is truly a blessing
8093225 the guys got a huge heart hes a great person its hard not to become good friends with michael
8093226 i felt as though i was really trying to mold the game by gaining peoples respect i took another risk and it didnt work out this time
8093227 under any other circumstances we probably never would have been friends
8093228 i cant wait for the show to be over to see them
8093229 i did get a few laughs out of it thats for sure
8093230 that is wrong they said the largest cast to be in the house at the same time that did not happen last year
8093231 yes folks you read correctly while big brother will be starting the season with the largest number of houseguests yet 14 shapiro did also reveal that the season will not be extended because of that fact
8093232 its just so vulgar you know such a vulgar word lesbian
8093233 i want to offer a different perspective of what gay women look like although the l word is doing that already everybodys got this stereotype for girls they dont see that some girls can like girls and still be feminine and still be chic and still care about their appearance
8093234 w hy not position a senator like claire mccaskill up there for five minutes and let her throw some red meat out to the crowd
8093235 t he republicans are going to use from day one through day four to hammer sen barack obama
8093236 w hy not position a senator like claire mccaskill d mo up there for five minutes and let her throw some red meat out to the crowd
8093237 he was very close to returning but the great part about michael is that he takes his time to think about things and he is very thorough
8093238 you can get excited about coming back and running through the tunnel one more time
8093239 in the end he felt he could not get back to where he was
8093240 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8093241 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8093242 its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize
8093243 we know the parameters of the contract and the giants would have been generous
8093244 parting is all we know of heaven and all we need of hell
8093245 this is a significant step for me to get back out on the practice field
8093246 if things go well as we expect they will then i hope to be full go next week and ready for the season opener
8093247 were going to monitor him and rookie tight end tom santi who will start practicing today
8093248 so we do have a pitch count on those guys

8093256 what would you rather do spend a week on pb amp j or a week of eating nothing but dessert
8093257 the unspoken truth is that these are really eccentric personalities we liquor them up and want them to act crazy but dont want them to get hurt
8093258 one of summers guiltiest pleasures is back and buzzing better than ever
8093259 longtime reality tv fans know to watch for the signs anytime the public is allowed to vote in a reality tv competition
8093260 cbs besides the usual lies and strategies secrets are part of the new season of
8093261 increased atmospheric carbon has a warming effect on the earth
8093262 while the scope and long term consequences of this warming effect are the subject of ongoing research we believe the united states should take measured and reasonable steps today
8093263 we look at capacity of our buses and make sure were not running buses out there that are half full
8093264 our drivers are being more aware of how they drive
8093265 we looked over all our routes and pulling out as many miles as we can
8093266 we tried to raise the rates somewhat but you cant even begin to cover that
8093267 when you consider a family of four kids who live 10 miles out they get a pretty healthy bill
8093268 sometimes they lose sight of how much it would cost them to run their kids to school themselves
8093269 hes really picked up the offense and appears comfortable with it
8093270 hell bring leadership to the huddle hes a big kid running and throwing the ball he has great tools i think hes going to be a good player for us in our system
8093271 there are a lot of decisions that have to happen real fast
8093272 this is the natural evolution for a show that already features so much viewer interactivity
8093273 text messaging will bring the big brother experience to living rooms across america allowing even greater participation from the viewing public its an organic extension of the big brother phenomenon and it will be incorporated seamlessly into the show
8093274 big brother is a show that has connected with a huge segment of the population that is not only open to this kind of participation but expects it
8093275 the interactive features that we are adding give the viewers an opportunity to become more invested in the program in addition to expanding the entertainment value of the show were committed to finding new ways to bring our viewers into our programming beyond just watching and we think this is a tremendous start
8093276 i am not sure that pas an islamist party is convinced that he can get 30 government mps to cross over
8093277 i have not departed from the commands of his lips i have treasured the words of his mouth more than my daily bread
8093278 i have treasured the words of his mouth more than my portion of food
8093279 but as surely as god is faithful our message to you is not
8093280 blessed is he who has regard for the weak the lord delivers him in times of trouble
8093281 teach your children to choose the right path and when they are older they will remain upon it
8093282 now it is god who makes both us and you stand firm in christ he anointed us set his seal of ownership on us and put his spirit in our hearts as a deposit guaranteeing what is to come
8093283 in the ancient world a seal was used to identify and to protect if something was sealed everyone knew who it belonged to the seal had an insignia and the seal prevented anyone else from tampering with the item the holy spirit is upon us to identify us and to protect us
8093284 money which in purchases is given as a pledge or downpayment that the full amount will subsequently be paid
8093285 assembly apparently the sinner repented but was not allowed back
8093286 paul told them to do more than forgive he also told them to comfort
8093287 there may be a judicial forgiveness which is hard and leaves the soul always conscious of the past comfort takes the soul to heart and forgets that is how god forgives and so should we who are his children
8093288 if discipline is largely lacking in the church of today so also is the grace of forgiving and comforting those who having done wrong are truly repentant how often alas souls have been indeed swallowed up with overmuch sorrow because of the harshness and suspicion of christian people toward them in view of some wrong which they have done love never slights holiness but holiness never slays love
8093289 in order that satan might not outwit us for we are not unaware of his schemes
8093290 satans strategy against the man was first of lust then of hopelessness and despair satans strategy against the church was first the toleration of evil then of undue severity in punishment satans strategy against paul was to simply make him so stressed and upset over the corinthian christians that he lost peace and was less effective in ministry
8093291 why are there so many obese folk filling the church pews across the country
8093292 the groans of the dying rise from the city and the wounded cry for help yet god does not respond to their moaning
8093293 the question is not where is god when it hurts but rather
8093294 faith is simply surrender i yield myself to the impression the tidings i hear make on me by faith i yield myself to the living god his glory and love fill my heart and have the mastery over my life
8093295 faith is fellowship i give myself up to the influence of the friend who makes me a promise and become linked to him by it and it is when we enter into this living fellowship with god himself in a faith that always sees and hears him that it becomes easy and natural to believe his promise as to prayer
8093296 faith in the promise is the fruit of faith in the promiser the prayer of faith is rooted in the life of faith and in this way the faith that prays effectively is indeed a gift of god not as something that he bestows or infuses at once but in a far deeper and truer sense as the blessed disposition or habit of soul which is wrought i e shaped fashioned formed and grows up in us in a life of intercourse i e intimate fellowship with him
8093297 though we have gods promises in the bible with full liberty to take them the spiritual power is wanting except as god himself speaks them to us and he speaks to those who walk and live with him therefore have faith in god
8093298 his glory and love fill my heart and have the mastery over my life

8093305 even today my complaint is bitter his hand is heavy in spite of my groaning 3 if only i knew where to find him if only i could go to his dwelling 4 i would state my case before him and fill my mouth with arguments
8093306 2as surely as god lives who has denied me justice the almighty who has made me taste bitterness ofsoul 3 as long as i have life within me the breath of god in my nostrils 4 my lips will not speak wickedness and my tongue will utter no deceit 5 i will never admit you are in the right till i die i will not deny my integrity 6 i will maintain my righteousness and never let go of it my conscience will not reproach me as long as i live

8093332 the proofing and approval process is one of the most common activities for agencies and designers yet one of the most un automated the majority of creatives still rely on email attachments to manage proofing with clients and internal teams this leads to a range of challenges and inefficiencies including struggles with file attachment sizes and the need to manually reconcile comments among multiple reviewers although organizations of nearly every type experience these challenges we decided to focus on solving the problem specifically for agencies designers print and production
8093333 proofhq is as simple to use as sending an email but offers enhanced tracking collaboration audit and automation capabilities most importantly proofhq is portable and flexible enough to adapt to a companys workflow instead of forcing an organization to adapt their processes to the software after all the end goal is to make it easier for everyone to get things done
8093334 with proofhq we can give our customers the added value and convenience of accessing their proofs over the internet without the worry that large files will clog their email servers each client has their own workspace on proofhq to keep all their proofs organized and we can even upload their logos for added personalization
8093335 from a designers perspective proofhq saves us significant time in client review and project management in just a few clicks i can upload a proof from my desktop and see at a glance which proofs are still open and which have been approved

8093340 since we offer packaging design print consultancy related to packaging and co packing services our new integrated software will be a hugely exciting development
8093341 it makes sense to pool the resources of our supplying companies so that we have the best possible combination of packages this complements our design and production operations as well as the needs of our client portfolio
8093342 the shows were a great success and a number of printers and shop owners were able to see the devices running live
8093343 they were also able to see how positively they could impact their operations and experience how simple they were to operate many of the attendees were making ink after a brief demonstration its just that easy
8093344 with the mx6 a printer can eliminate wasted ink a lot of press downtime and waste ink disposal fees
8093345 the roi on these devices is also extremely fast some of our customers have been able to justify them in a few months and after they are paid for they become a substantial profit center i cant think of a printer in america who couldnt benefit from this technology especially in this economic climate
8093346 our fujifilm partners did a great job of arranging and hosting each program and we received some very good feedback looking ahead we will have the mx6 in our booth at graph expo this fall october 26 29 at chicagos mccormick place as will our fujifilm partners

8093398 the big brother 6 live webcast with realnetworks has become immensely popular as fans can check in on the houseguests at anytime and see the action unfold
8093399 whether used as a companion to the prime time series or as live theatre in its own right its a unique internet experience that further connects the fan to the show
8093400 big brother 6 online demonstrates how the internet and tv industries can work together to create a richer experience for consumers

8093403 secrets lies and strategies are all part of the new season of big brother
8093404 rachel plencner a 33 year old horse breeder from parker is one of 14 contestants competing in cbs big brother 6 premiering at 7 p
8093405 this summer cbs com is going all out to provide big brother fans the broadest and most exciting companion experience weve ever offered
8093406 from the 24 7 live internet feed to the new blog to the daily talk show big brother viewers will have unparalleled access to activities in the big brother house and a new level of involvement with the show
8093407 with the debut of big brother 6 tonight on cbs north america will be introduced to another set of quirky houseguests
8093408 you may have already received an e mail on behalf of this statement but i think it there may be more that is going between the lines not only does each pair think theyre the only pair but they have to keep it a secret therefore each pair i would hope has the sense to be careful what they tell the others to refrain from getting caught and losing the big money
8093409 hey i am from the same city as this guy
8093410 kaysar lives in the same apartment complex as michael michael grew up in abu dhabi so he must speak arabic kaysar speaks arabic
8093411 hey guys i just wanted to apologize for the wrong dates
8093412 when watching the show last night my friend quickly realized he recognized beau from high school
8093413 big brother 6 will walk into the house with a ready made alliance a best friend co worker or significant other
8093414 the incentive is for partners to get to the end of the game sitting side by side
8093415 if they do the winner will get 1 million and the second place person will get 250 000 its in their best interests to keep it a secret
8093416 these are people who already like each other but the question is will the friendships last until the end when moneys involved
8093417 last year it was a twin twist the year before it was the ex factor this year there are a number of secrets involving the cast involving the new house and involving the game and like an onion theyll be peeled away week after week throughout the summer
8093418 the fact that were getting a signal to cbs television city is a credit to him
8093419 watch live 24 7 video feeds from the big brother house
8093420 yes folks you read correctly while big brother will be starting the season with the largest number of houseguests yet 14 shapiro did also reveal that the season will not be extended because of that fact
8093421 everyone has a secret big brother has many this season and he aint giving them up without a fight
8093422 this season we have what we are calling the summer of secrets meaning that because it is a brand new house there will be multiple secrets uncovered throughout the summer that the houseguests will find
8093423 we were able to do that because we have a brand new setting
8093424 there are secrets that will be revealed which will impact this cast in a different way than other casts have been impacted the same could be said of the x factor and last years dna theme
8093425 i think it is one of the very best casts we have ever had based on looking at them as an entire group of 14 and as distinct individuals and what they have going for themselves it will be much clearer to you when they are in the house and the secrets start being revealed it is very possible that the configuration of this cast may also lead to the uncovering of some secrets you never know
8093426 there is no moderator and the only recognizable face will be returning host julie chen
8093427 that is absolutely untrue as you know we have a new big brother house in a new big brother compound i dont think that cbs would have gone to all the expense of relocating us if they werent in it for the long haul
8093428 there is no show on television to compare this to in terms of the experience i have done live television before i started in live television but that was one show a week and it was a half hour so there is a big difference i think that what keeps us coming back is we love doing the show and we love the challenge of thinking up new twists and new surprises each year
8093429 neither of us has had a summer since when we started this it is a seven day a week job and this is the longest running reality show as in the number of days of production this is close to 90 days and it is non stop it is essentially a live show many of the other reality shows are completed taped and edited before they go on the air they know who the winners are and it makes the editing easier we are different we are experiencing it along with the audience

8093452 a prayer warrior can pray for a thing to be done without necessarily being willing for the answer to come through himself and he is not bound to continue in the prayer until it is answered but an intercessor is responsible to gain his objective and he can never be free till he has gained it he will go to any lengths for the prayer to be answered through himself but once a position of intercession has been gained tested and proved the intercessor can claim all the blessings on that grade whenever it is gods will for him to do so
8093453 there was a soul whom he had never met whom he had no possible means of influencing except by way of the throne
8093454 for this he was going to be turned aside from his work among men to deal only with god
8093455 prayer has failed we are on slippery ground only intercession will avail god is calling for intercessors men and women who will lay their lives on the altar to fight the devil as really they would have to fight the enemy on the western front

8093470 alam mo naniniwala ako na kung anuman ang dinadaanan o pinagdadaanan ng isang tao its for him just like ive said he needed that its a humbling experience and its a reality check hindi ko sinasabi na he deserves it but he needed that to realize a lot of things
8093471 different forms different problems pero same emotions kung anuman ang pinagdaanan niya maybe patas ng pinagdaanan ko god kasi he just moves on different ways he shows himself in different ways different situations it doesnt mean problem its just an obstacle that you really have to go through he bernard needed that to become who he is right now im sure his family is proud of him
8093472 kung nagtatrabaho man siyang mabuti ngayon dapat lang naman because parents should do that for their kids i think thats the rightful thing to do on both our sides because kung anuman ang pinagdanan mo sa past sa parents mo sa life mo dapat hindi ganun ang ibibigay natin sa anak natin
8093473 sa ngayon hindi pa siya nagbibigay ng financial support but you know he gives mga diapers milk supplies and it helps yung support financially kasi i dont ask and i will never ask
8093474 mababait sila mahal na mahal ko yung family ni bernard sincerely dumadalaw kami you really have to put aside para sa anak ko
8093475 talaga hindi ko alam ang tungkol diyan but thats good sana siya na lang ang mag file

8093480 unang una malayo na siya kung magkakabalikan kami parang wala rin mahirap kasi yung long distance love affair di ba
8093481 ako rin siguro wala na yung love na naramdaman ko sa kanya dati
8093482 sabihin na natin na kung mahal ko man siya ngayon parang bilang sa isang kaibigan na lang

8093560 a person may be liable for negligently entrusting an automobile to one who the person knows or should know is incompetent inexperienced or reckless
8093561 it is negligence to permit a third person to use a thing or engage in an activity which is under the control of an actor if the actor knows or should know that such person intends or is likely to use the thing or to conduct himself in the activity in such a manner as to create an unreasonable risk of harm to others

8093565 once a statute of limitations has expired the defendant has a vested right to invoke the bar of the limitations period as a defense to a cause of action that right cannot be taken away by the legislature wothout offending the due process protections of our states constitution
8093566 the law applied was that which was in effect at the time of the appeal unless the use of that law somehow interfered with a vested right with the vested rights approach the legislatures intent regarding retroactivity was not relevant
8093567 under the legislative intent approach the presumption is against retroactive application of the statutory changes unless the legislature clearly indicates an intent that the amendments be so applied
8093568 the changes made by this amendatory act of the 93rd general assembly apply to actions pending on the effective date of this amendatory act of the 93rd general assembly as well as actions commenced on or after that date
8093569 under the ladgraf approach we must first determine if the legislature expressed its intent relative to retroactivity if the legislatures intent is clear we must give effect to that intent unless constitutional principles otherwise prohibit the application the vested rights inquiry is now a default rule that need only be considered in the absence of of express legislative intent regarding retroactivity
8093570 to determine if retroactive application unreasonably infringes on rights implicated
8093571 in assessing the fairness of a retroactive application relevant considerations include 1 the legislatures motive in enacting the statutory change 2 the period of retroactivity and 3 whether the parties detrimentally relied on the prior version of the law
8093572 in balancing fairness considerations and the reasons for and against the retroactive application of the statutory change we conclude that the retroactive application does not unreasoonably infringe on any due process right

8093579 because the text and commentary on fmvss 205 show that it is best understood as a minimum safety standard we hold that the oharas common law negligence and strict liability claims are not preempted

8093699 in the last long bear market 1969 to 1982 stocks returned just 5 6 annually after inflation investors lost more than 2 a year that mauling by the bear made stocks so inexpensive that over the ensuing 18 years they went up 18 5 a year enough to turn 10 000 into more than 200 000 the people who so far this year have yanked 39 billion out of u s stock funds and 6 billion out of exchange traded stock funds do not understand this but if you are still in your saving and investing years a bear market is a gift from the financial gods and the longer it lasts the better off you will be instead of running from the bear you should embrace him

8093703 there are thousands who are in opinion opposed to slavery and to the war who yet in effect do nothing to put an end to them who esteeming themselves children of washington and franklin sit down with their hands in their pockets and say that they know not what to do and do nothing they hesitate and they regret and sometimes they petition but they do nothing in earnest and with effect

8093722 desire for regime change was not a legal base for military action
8093723 when the prime minister discussed iraq with president bush at crawford the bush ranch in texas in april he said that the uk would support military action to bring about regime change
8093724 i said that you would not budge in your support for regime change but you had to manage a press a parliament and a public opinion
8093725 i opened by sticking very closely to the script that you used with condi rice we backed regime change but the plan had to be clever and failure was not an option
8093726 if the political context were right people would support regime change
8093727 but the case was thin saddam was not threatening his neighbours and his wmd capability was less than that of libya north korea or iran
8093728 we should work up an ultimatum to saddam to allow back in the un weapons inspectors this would also help with the legal justification for the use of force
8093729 should continue to work on the assumption that the uk would take part in any military action
8093730 the idea that we had decided definitively for military action at that stage is wrong and disproved by the fact that several months later we went back to the un to get a final resolution and actually the conflict didnt begin until four months after that
8093731 we have had no news from florence aubenas in over 24 hours
8093732 every effort is being made by our representatives in baghdad and by the ministry in paris to find them
8093733 my strong sense is that a lot of the political momentum that was generated out of the successful election which was sort of like a punch in the gut to the insurgents has worn off
8093734 the army was pauls life from a youngster all he ever wanted to be was a soldier
8093735 he was a quiet gentle and a kind man who could be humorous
8093736 the patrol defended itself and killed a number of insurgents before withdrawing unfortunately one soldier was killed and another injured
8093737 obviously there are disparate small groups of insurgents but it is the background level of nuisance activity we are used to
8093738 he said he had been freed and that his captors had taken nothing from him

8093742 i was lined up near the medical centre waiting for my turn for the medical exam in order to apply for work in the police
8093743 suddenly i heard a very big explosion i was thrown several metres away and i had burns in my legs and hands then i was taken to the hospital
8093744 i was lucky because i was the last person in line when the explosion took place
8093745 all the hospitals rooms even those used for cardiology are filled with the wounded
8093746 iraqis should be able to start taking over more and more security responsibilities very soon
8093747 but we will continue to need and to seek assistance for some time to come
8093748 that is the kind of cancer you have got the cut out quickly
8093749 this is naked aggression against the iraqi people we will bring them to justice
8093750 these people are getting desperate i would be surprised if this were the last one
8093751 there is no place in this country where it would be possible to prevent someone willing to give up their life to detonate a bomb
8093752 you want to be able to record onto tape and get your takes done piecing it all together on a computer theres no thrill and no real reward in that if you play a helicopter flight simulator and you crash you just hit re set but if you learn to fly a helicopter and you crash you die the thing is at least when youre flying you actually get the thrill of flying

8093759 as those presents are always the most fashionable and sometimes the most valued which cannot be used i give you this book which you will not be able to read but which perhaps you will kindly preserve in memory of its writer
8093760 a blog is a unending book in which the author keeps writing the first page for readers constantly waiting for the last
8093761 by necessity by proclivity and by delight we all quote
8093762 time was when readers kept commonplace books the practice spread everywhere in early modern england among ordinary readers as well as famous writers like francis bacon ben jonson john milton and john locke it involved a special way of taking in the printed word unlike modern readers who follow the flow of a narrative from beginning to end early modern englishmen read in fits and starts and jumped from book to book they broke texts into fragments and assembled them into new patterns by transcribing them in different sections of their notebooks then they reread the copies and rearranged the patterns while adding more excerpts reading and writing were therefore inseparable activities they belonged to a continuous effort to make sense of things for the world was full of signs you could read your way through it and by keeping an account of your readings you made a book of your own one stamped with your personality
8093763 for centuries philosophers scholars lawyers doctors theologians artists poets and others have taken the time to write down the memorable thoughts and words of others or kept records of their own personal musings and collected them in journal or book form
8093764 i have long had a thirst for the historical sensibility of the spiritual life that is a desire to find others in history whose insight into the human spirit and perhaps even the divine cosmic human relationship could enrich my own by reaching across time and culture to the present through their writings historical figures provide a special perspective and challenge and they help to ground us in a humanity that is not merely the conditioning of our present age one of the ways in which i have learned about and come to appreciate the spiritual writings of the past has been through collections of excerpts excerpts which have been assiduously gathered by commonplacers
8093765 naked i came into the world but brush strokes cover me language raises me music rhythms me art is my rod and staff my resting place and shield and not mine only for art leaves nobody out even those from whom art has been stolen away by tyranny by poverty begin to make it again if the arts did not exist at every moment someone would begin to create them in song out of dust and mud and although the artifacts might be destroyed the energy that creates them is not destroyed
8093766 things are because we see them and what we see and how we see it depends on the arts that have influenced us to look at a thing is very different from seeing a thing one does not see anything until one sees its beauty
8093767 you know it is good to hide your brilliance under a bushel to be anonymous to love what you are doing and not to show off it is good to be kind without a name that does not make you famous it does not cause your photograph to appear in the newspapers politicians do not come to your door you are just a creative human being living anonymously and in that there is richness and great beauty

8093779 thought pushes experience further opens up new dimensions for it and refines what comes to experience experience pushes thought further opens up new dimensions for thinking and sets limits to its excursions the brilliance of zen thinking is its tentative and provisional character the non abiding non grasping mind knowing through thought that all thought is empty zen masters have explored worlds of reflection unavailable to other traditions playfully thinking what lies beneath commonsense the zen master is one who no longer seeks solid ground who realizes that all things and situations are supported not by firm ground and solid self nature but rather by shifting and contingent relations he no longer needs to hold his ground in dialogue and therefore does not falter when all grounds give way his role in dialogue is to reflect in a selfless way whatever is manifest or can become manifest in the moment
8093780 life is serious all the time but living cannot be you may have all the solemnity you wish in your neckties but in anything important such as sex death and religion you must have mirth or you will have madness
8093781 wilt thou have youth or beauty or power or long life or the most beautiful maiden or any other glorious thing among the many we have here in the treasure chest then choose but one thing
8093782 highly esteemed contemporaries i choose one thing that i may always have the laugh on my side
8093783 how is it that we need all this prodding all these warnings and earnest invitations and promises of infinite rewards to persuade us to take a really close look at ourselves why dont all intelligent and serious people make it their chief business in life to find out whose life it is
8093784 the most expedient method for dislodging the id entity is to confront it directly and ask tough questions
8093785 how do you go about finding anything by keeping your mind and heart in it interest there must be and steady remembrance to remember what needs to be remembered is the secret of success you come to it through earnestness when you are in dead earnest you bend every incident every second of your life to your purpose you do not waste time and energy on other things you are totally dedicated to know that you are a prisoner of your mind that you live in an imaginary world of your own creation is the dawn of wisdom to want nothing of it to be ready to abandon it entirely is earnestness
8093786 im frequently overwhelmed by the monotony of a typical day like most people i pretend not to be excited by catastrophes i prefer a life that wont cohere that scrutiny might destroy to a life the populace might approve of to my fellow prisoners i say just because the escape tunnel goes on forever is no reason to stop digging because ive often felt what ive said i know that nobodys problem was ever solved by feeling deeply about it ive said the opposite of this and stand by what i said i am a pagan and enjoy a pagans tragic optimism ill dance to almost anything however awful if the beat is good i know several consolations for the letdowns and sorrows of experience but intend to keep them to myself every secret ive ever told concealed another secret i prefer relationships in which so little is asked of me i feel free enough to be generous
8093787 at days end what honest effort do you look back upon did you express one thought that was not in defense did you look at your self from another persons perspective did you understand the why behind another persons actions did you laugh at your self did you remember you will die how long till you experience one night utterly alone where silence absorbs every hope and boils you down to zero how long till you remember these questions every day then end them
8093788 each mans life represents a road towards himself an attempt at such a road the intimidation of a path no man has ever been entirely and completely himself yet each one strives to become that one in an awkward the other in a more intelligent way each as best as he can
8093789 simplicity in conduct in beliefs and in environment brings an individual very close to the truth of reality individuals who practice simplicity cannot be used because they already have everything they need they cannot be lied to because a lie merely reveals to them another aspect of reality an attraction to simplicity is essentially an attraction to freedom the highest expression of personal power we are taught to think of freedom as something one has but it is really the absence of things that brings freedom to the individual and meaning into life to let go of things unnecessary desires superfluous possessions is to have them lao tzu believed that an individual life contains the whole universe but when individuals develop fixations about certain parts of life they become narrow and shallow and uncentered fixations and desires create a crisis within the mind as individuals let go of desires feelings of freedom security independence and power increase accordingly
8093790 as incredible as it sounds an unhappy man does not realize that happiness is better than unhappiness knowing only his own concealed anguish he worships it which is the same as self worship
8093791 if we fall into hell we go through hell this is the most important attitude to have
8093792 we say you cannot divert the river from the river bed
8093793 rabbi levi yitzhak of berditchev was a hasidic master and when his only son died the funeral bier was taken through the village and the congregation followed behind in deep silence
8093794 a pure soul was rendered to me and a pure soul i render back
8093795 we can live any way we want people take vows of poverty chastity and obedience even of silence by choice the thing is to stalk your calling in a certain skilled and supple way to locate the most tender and live spot and plug into that pulse this is yielding not fighting i think it would be well and proper and obedient and pure to grasp your one necessity and not let it go to dangle from it limp wherever it takes you then even death where youre going no matter how you live cannot you part seize it and let it seize you up aloft even till your eyes burn out and drop let your musky flesh fall off in shreds and let your very bones unhinge and scatter loosened over fields over fields and woods lightly thoughtless from any height at all from as high as eagles
8093796 though i do not expect that i shall be reborn directly as a crocus i know that one day my atoms will inhabit a bacterium here a diatom there a nematode or a flagellate even a crayfish or a sea cucumber i will be here in myriad forms for as long as there are forms of life on earth i have always been here and with a certain effort of will i can sometimes remember
8093797 you become sense and the whole becomes object sense and object mingle and unite then each returns to its place and the object rent from sense is a perception and you rent from the object are for yourselves a feeling it is this earlier moment i mean which you always experience yet never experience the phenomenon of your life is just the result of its constant departure and return it is scarcely in time at all so swiftly it passes it can scarcely be described so little does it properly exist it is immediate raised above all error and misunderstanding you lie directly on the bosom of the infinite world
8093798 the real distinguishing factor between the little self and the higher self is that the little self is acutely aware of itself as a distinct separate individual and a sense of solitude or of separation sometimes comes in the existential experience in contrast the experience of the spiritual self is a sense of freedom of expansion of communication with other selves and with reality and there is the sense of universality it feels itself at the same time individual and universal
8093799 you have seen that the universe is at root a magical illusion and a fabulous game and that there is no separate
8093800 the extravagant gesture is the very stuff of creation after one extravagant gesture of creation in the first place the universe has continued to deal exclusively in extravagances flinging intricacies and colossi down aeons of emptiness heaping profusions on profligacies with fresh vigor the whole show has been on fire since the word go
8093801 in considering what is possible for the future one must be careful not to slide into denial imagination can so easily be trapped by the wish to escape painful facts and unbearable conclusions the new age idea that one can wish oneself out of any circumstance disease or bad fortune is not only sadly disrespectful toward suffering it is also in the end dangerous if escape replaces awareness at the same time the act of seeing changes those who see this is perhaps most clear with self perception by my perceptions of who i am or what i feel not only do i re create my idea of who i am but i also change myself perception is not simply a reflection of reality but a powerful element of reality anyone who meditates has had this experience observing the activities of the mind changes the mind until bit by bit observation creates great changes in the soul and the effect is the same when the act of perception is collective a change in public perception will change the public this is why acts of imagination are so important like artistic and literary movements social movements are driven by imagination i am not speaking here only of the songs and poems and paintings that have always been part of movements for political and social change but of the movements themselves their political ideas and forms of protest every important social movement reconfigures the world in the imagination what was obscure comes forward lies are revealed memory shaken new delineations drawn over the old maps it is from this new way of seeing the present that hope for the future emerges
8093802 think of it all that speech pouring down selling nothing judging nobody drenching the thick mulch of dead leaves soaking the trees filling the gullies and crannies of the wood with water what a thing to sit absolutely alone in the forest at night cherished by this wonderful unintelligible perfectly innocent speech the talk that rain makes by itself all over the ridges and the talk of the watercourses everywhere in the hollows nobody started it nobody is going to stop it it will talk as long as it wants this rain as long as it talks i am going to listen
8093803 item six on the agenda the meaning of life now harry youve had some thoughts on this
8093804 thats right yeah ive had a team working on this over the past few weeks and what weve come up with can be reduced to two fundamental concepts one people are not wearing enough hats two matter is energy in the universe there are many energy fields which we cannot normally perceive some energies have a spiritual source which act upon a persons soul however this soul does not exist ab initio it has to be brought into existence by a process of guided self observation however this is rarely achieved owing to mans unique ability to be distracted from spiritual matters by everyday trivia
8093805 at the height of laughter the universe is flung into a kaleidoscope of new possibilities laughter is the loaded latency given us by nature as part of our native equipment to break up the stalemates of our lives and urge us on to deeper and more complex forms of knowing
8093806 i have not always had this certainty this pessimism which reassures the best among us there was a time when my friends laughed at me i was not the master of my words a certain indifference i have not always known well what i wanted to say but most often it was because i had nothing to say the necessity of speaking and the desire not to be heard my life hanging only by a thread there was a time when i seemed to understand nothing my chains floated on the water all my desires are born of my dreams and i have proven my love with words to what fantastic creatures have i entrusted myself in what dolorous and ravishing world has my imagination enclosed me i am sure of having been loved in the most mysterious of domains my own the language of my love does not belong to human language my human body does not touch the flesh of my love my amorous imagination has always been constant and high enough so that nothing could attempt to convince me of error
8093807 the false self consists of all of the efforts we make to nurture a reputation for ourselves in the mind of others in our culture we have a compulsive need to be validated by external sources but the true self is one that is wholly separate from this fragile image that we try to construct in the imagination of others the true self is like a very shy wild animal that never appears at all whenever an alien presence is at hand and comes out only when all is peaceful when he is untroubled and alone he cannot be lured by anyone or anything because he responds to no lure except that of the divine freedom
8093808 part of my intensely deep practice in germany was walking for several hours a day in the woods that surrounded the town it was an integral part of the meditation i began to think that meditation or contemplative practice that is divorced from the world is a little bit crazy these practices in fact tend to have been developed in the natural world buddha sat under a bodhi tree jesus wandered and fasted in the desert all of these practices are very deep in their origin with a very deep connection with the earth you open so much that the earth then teaches the wisdom encoded in nature simply speaks its wonderful to meditate in a hall or to pray in a church its fabulous but if thats the only place we do it were actually missing what the practices originally gave people when they were founded
8093809 on one of his rare trips outside of the monastery thomas merton traveled to columbia university in new york to meet daisetz t
8093810 it was at once as if nothing at all had happened and as if the roof had flown off the building but in reality nothing had happened a very old deaf zen man with bushy eyebrows had drunk a cup of tea as though with the complete wakefulness of a child and yet as though at the same time declaring with utter finality this is not important
8093811 truth does not become more valid because it is seen by the light of a chinese lantern or wrapped in a japanese kimono the masters may have been distinguishable because they wore mongolian masks but the real souls of absolutism were universal and cosmopolitan take them out of the oriental environment and they are still great masters many of the greatest are probably unknown preached but little did not seek disciples and were never entangled in monastic life they lived like leaves blown by the wind if realization does not give real freedom then it is not realization liberation has no entanglements and involvements and those who permit them are not liberated
8093812 the house is such a literal metaphor for ones own spirit this person is no doubt a little bit afraid of looking at herself and of growing into the greatest version of herself possible

8093848 social networking sites do not necessarily involve communication dialogue or collaboration instead the paper argues transparency is a dominating feature an interesting aspect of social interaction in social networking sites is that the starting point is the individual or personal this is in opposition to discussion forums in which communication always takes place in a shared forum in a social networking site each individual has a personal page and profile which the individual develops and modifies the paper will discuss how social networking may be utilized within university education by students sharing information and resources that are originally developed for themselves but made available to others for instance bookmarks references links and notes in conclusion the paper argues that the pedagogical potential of social networking lies within transparency and the ability to create awareness between students potentially across institutions and nations

8093859 i am only a ferryman and it is my task to take people across this river i have taken thousands of people across and to all of them my river has been nothing but a hindrance on their journey they have travelled for money and business to weddings and on pilgrimages but the river has been in their way and the ferryman was there to take them quickly across the obstacle however amongst the thousands there have been a few four or five to whom the river was not an obstacle they have heard its voice and listened to it and the river has become holy to them as it has to me have you learned the secret from the river that there is no such thing as time that the river is everywhere at the same time at the source and at the mouth at the waterfall at the ferry at the current in the ocean and in the mountains everywhere and the present only exists for it not the shadow of the past nor the shadow of the future
8093860 i think it is time to face yourself again stonepeace
8093861 oh there is trouble so im going about things the wrong way
8093862 you yourself should reprove yourself should examine yourself your own self is your own mainstay your own self is your own guide therefore you should watch over yourself as a trader a fine steed
8093863 following the master following the sutras all this means to follow oneself the sutras are an expression of yourself the master is your master when you travel far and wide to meet with masters that means that you travel far and wide to meet with yourself when you pick a hundred weeds you are picking yourself a hundred times and when you climb ten thousand trees you are climbing yourself ten thousand times understand that when you practice in this way you are practicing yourself practicing and understanding this you will let go of yourself and get a real taste of yourself for the first time
8093864 being your true self being your true nature is different than experiencing it with thought realize that you are the mystery and that you cant really look at the mystery because you are only capable of looking
8093865 im still somebody and ive got all these anxious thoughts and wants and desires
8093866 our existences precede our essences as sartre put it i dont know what im here for until ive lived my life my life who i am is not determined by god by the laws of nature by my genetics by my society not even by my family they each may provide the raw material for who i am but it is how i choose to live that makes me what i am i create myself
8093867 when zen master seung sahn had been in this country for six or eight months everybody was always asking him questions about korea buddhism and enlightenment
8093868 i am a man already enlightenment has passed through your fingers its not a thing you cant get it nobody can get it buddha didnt get it either so we dont have to worry were all in the same family and thats wonderful
8093869 the greatest danger that of losing ones own self may pass off quietly as if it were nothing every other loss that of an arm a leg five dollars a wife etc is sure to be noticed
8093870 you know you could not see me unless you could also see my background what stands behind me if i myself the boundaries of my skin were coterminous with your whole field of vision you would not see me at all you would not see me because in order to see me not only would you have to see what is inside the boundary of my skin but also what is outside it this is terribly important really the fundamental ultimate mystery the only thing you need to know to understand the deepest metaphysical secrets is this that for every outside there is an inside and for every inside there is an outside and though they are different they go together there is in other words a secret conspiracy between all insides and all outsides and the conspiracy is this to look as different as possible and yet underneath to be identical because you do not find one without the other
8093871 in your lump of red flesh is a true person without rank who is always going in and out of your senses those who have not yet realized this should look look
8093872 our continual mistake is that we do not concentrate upon the present day the actual hour of our life we live in the past or in the future we are continually expecting the coming of some special hour when our life shall unfold itself in its full significance and we do not observe that life is flowing like water through our fingers sifting like precious grain from a loosely fastened bag
8093873 life is enough unto itself to be is in its absolute essence an ineffable inexpressible inexhaustible event of beauty and strangeness the staggering aspect of being is that it is and that it is thoroughly incomprehensible
8093874 i am not dreaming this is a real day a beautiful one do we want to return to the past and play hide and seek
8093875 ultimately man should not ask what the meaning of his life is but rather must recognize that it is he who is asked
8093876 no i cant do it im not worthy im too busy i dont have the capacity im too old too lazy too fat too thin too timid and besides i think you have the wrong person
8093877 seeking happiness outside ourselves is like waiting for sunshine in a cave facing north
8093878 actually zen does require a leap of faith to be mindful you have to believe that life is worth paying attention to to meditate you have to believe you are worth getting to know to reach a state of inner peace you have to believe that you have peace within you and that your true nature is already complete you have to believe inner peace is possible that you are already perfect that you dont need to add anything to yourself if at this moment you dont believe some of these things thats okay if you can take them on faith at least for awhile then you can decide for yourself
8093879 absolute faith is placed in a mans own inner being for whatever authority there is in zen all comes from within
8093880 if you are wandering about in your head you may miss the vital path of letting your body leap
8093881 zen is empty there is nothing in it there is no room for any ism not buddhism not taoism who you are is all it is
8093882 there is no path to truth truth must be discovered but there is no formula for its discovery what is formulated is not true you must set out on the uncharted sea and the uncharted sea is yourself you must set out to discover yourself but not according to any plan or pattern for then there is no discovery
8093883 your wits cant thicken in that soft moist air on those white springy roads in those misty rushes and brown bogs on those hillsides of granite rocks and magenta heather youve no such colours in the sky no such lure in the distances no such sadness in the evenings oh the dreaming the dreaming the torturing heart scalding never satisfying dreaming dreaming dreaming dreaming
8093884 to reach the fundamental ground is not something like going from the country to the city or from one land to another in reality it is like waking up from a dream all the questions about where the fundamental ground is and how to get there are part of the dream arising from the thoughts of a dream about a dream
8093885 when you live your life at peace with every circumstance of your life favorable or terrible you situate yourself at the still point of the turning universe
8093886 when you encounter those who are wicked unrighteous foolish dim witted deformed vicious chronically ill lonely unfortunate or disabled you should think
8093887 how far i have strayed from the way how can i betray the old sages
8093888 pedestals were invented by a very wise man who perceived the need in human consciousness to cast people down this wise man realized that it would be impossible to cast people down unless you had put them up on something first so he invented the pedestal which is now employed on a regular basis you put people on it so you can cast them down later indeed he was a wise man
8093889 day by day we all meet events that seem to be most unfair and we feel that the only way to handle an attack is to fight back and the way we fight is with our minds we arm ourselves with our anger and our opinions our self righteousness and we think this is the way to live our life all that we accomplish is to increase the separation to escalate the anger and to make ourselves and everyone else miserable
8093890 the universe takes on a whole new meaning when you know that your place in it was not foreordained that it was not designed for us indeed that it was not designed at all if we are nothing more than star stuff how special life becomes how inspiring it is to share in the sublimity of knowledge generated by other human minds and perhaps to even make a tiny contribution toward that body of knowledge that will be passed down through the ages part of the cumulative wisdom of a single species on a tiny planet orbiting an ordinary star on the remote edge of a not so unusual galaxy itself a member of a cluster of galaxies millions of light years from nowhere
8093891 after sleeping through a hundred million centuries we have finally opened our eyes on a sumptuous planet sparkling with color and bountiful with life within decades we must close our eyes again isnt it a noble an enlightened way of spending our brief time in the sun to work at understanding the universe and how we have come to wake up in it this is how i answer when i am asked as i am surprisingly often why i bother to get up in the mornings to put it the other way round isnt it sad to go to your grave without ever wondering why you were born who with such a thought would not spring from bed eager to resume discovering the world and rejoicing to be part of it
8093892 we are the miracle of force and matter making itself over into imagination and will incredible the life force experimenting with forms you for one me for another the universe has shouted itself alive we are one of the shouts
8093893 its not outer circumstances or conditions that entangle us naropa its internal clinging and fixations that entangle us it is not what happens to us that determines our karma our destiny our character and the kind of experience we have in life it is how we relate to what happens that makes all the difference
8093894 dear stalkers we love u thx 4 your support better u there than here see ya on the outside luv the surviving 7
8093895 dear marcellas gretchen and bb5 fans we luv u thx 4 your support better u there than here see ya on the outside luv the surviving 7
8093896 if you can see the bright sun shining on the snow if you can feel the icy wind blowing across the face of the earth then what more can be said what more can anyone add see that intimacy make it your own then throw it away and keep going ultimately every single thing you do in this practice has to resolve itself into the moment to moment reality of your life everything you do every breath you take every action you make its an incredible gift to have the opportunity to practice this dharma to even know that it exists millions upon millions of humans have gone from cradle to grave without ever even knowing that its possible to put an end to suffering that its possible to manifest their life in a way thats in harmony with things that nourishes rather than poisons the fact that we have the opportunity to realize that we shouldnt take it lightly we should accept it with gratitude and practice it with the whole body and mind and repay the efforts of all the buddhas and ancestors that have preceded us by giving life to the buddha and you do that by making it your own
8093897 there is no greater mystery than this that we keep seeking reality though in fact we are reality we think that there is something hiding reality and that this must be destroyed before reality is gained how ridiculous a day will dawn when you will laugh at all your past efforts that which will be the day you laugh is also here and now
8093898 to practice zen means to realize ones existence moment after moment rather than letting life unravel in regret of the past and daydreaming of the future
8093899 for a long time i wondered what the zen concept of time was
8093900 childhood is full of mystery and promise and perhaps the life fear comes when all the mysteries are laid open when what we thought we wanted is attained it is just at the moment of seeming fulfillment that we sense irrevocable betrayal like a great wave rising silently behind us confronted by the uncouth specter of old age disease and death we are thrown back upon the present on this moment here right now for that is all there is and surely this is the paradise of children that they are at rest in the present like frogs or rabbits
8093901 in other days i understood mountains differently seeing in them something that abides
8093902 i go down along the canyon rim and sit still against a rock
8093903 soen relates how once in london he was on the point of entering the bathroom when christmas humphreys passing by said it was occupied
8093904 wait as long as you like never anybody there from the beginning
8093905 zen is very simple what are you in this whole world everyone searches for happiness outside but nobody understands their true self inside everybody says i i want this i am like that but nobody understands this i before you were born where did your i come from when you die where will your i go if you sincerely ask what am i sooner or later you will run into a wall where all thinking is cut off we call this dont know zen is keeping this dont know mind always and everywhere
8093906 if koan are teaching devices designed to break down intellectual concepts of reality and open the way for a profound apprehension of the universal reality beneath they are also pure expressions of enlightened mind
8093907 is quite literally a touch stone of reality in which a key issue of practice and realization is presented and examined by experience rather than by discursive or linear logic to help us penetrate more deeply into the significance of life and death
8093908 truth is revealed it cannot ever be told it has to appear inside the telling or through the telling
8093909 the need to open up an inner freedom and vision which is found in relatedness to something in us which we dont really know this is not just the psychological unconscious it is much more than that the real inner life and freedom of man begin when this inner dimension opens up and man lives in communion with the unknown within him on the basis of this he can also be in communion with the same unknown in others how to describe it impossible to describe it
8093910 it is imperative to cut off the mind road if you do not cut off the mind road you will be a ghost clinging to the grass
8093911 the bell but if there were no bell stick how would the sound appear
8093912 the stick if there were no air how could the sound come here
8093913 air but unless you have an ear you cannot hear the bell sound
8093914 yes i need an ear to hear it so it comes from there
8093915 your ear if you have no consciousness how can you understand the bell sound
8093916 your consciousness so ananda if you have no mind how do you hear the bell sound
8093917 in fact everything we encounter in this world with our six senses is an inkblot test you see what you are thinking and feeling seldom what you are looking at
8093918 the more we persist in misunderstanding the phenomena of life the more we analyze them out into strange finalities and complex purposes of our own the more we involve ourselves in sadness but it does not matter much because no despair of ours can alter the reality of things or stain the joy of the cosmic dance which is always there indeed we are in the midst of it and it is in the midst of us for it beats in our very blood whether we want it to or not
8093919 earths crammed with heaven and every common bush afire with god but only he who sees takes off his shoes
8093920 just as the highest and the lowest notes are equally inaudible so perhaps is the greatest sense and the greatest nonsense equally unintelligible
8093921 there is tremendous power in unearthing in recognizing distracted scattered mind the mind which would rather be anywhere but here and spending some time there with that mind rather than being an anonymous voice from the dark bossing you around scattered mind is someone you can sit down and hang out with
8093922 we do not receive wisdom we must discover it for ourselves after a journey through the wilderness which no one else can make for us which no one can spare us for our wisdom is the point of view from which we come at last to regard the world
8093923 the first day of spring is one thing and the first spring day is another the difference between them is sometimes as great as a month
8093924 to find the universal elements enough to find the air and the water exhilarating to be refreshed by a morning walk or an evening saunter to be thrilled by the stars at night to be elated over a birds nest or a wildflower in spring these are some of the rewards of the simple life
8093925 when you feel that you are a lonely put upon isolated little stranger confronting all this you are under the influence of an illusory feeling because the truth is quite the reverse you are the whole works all that there is and always was and always has been and always will be
8093926 9th century zen master tozan ryokai attained enlightenment many times
8093927 dont try to figure out who you are if you figure out who you are what you understand will be far away from you you will have just an image of yourself
8093928 listening whether to a book or to a person is the most challenging of the arts because in listening truly we have to become aware of our own resistances to what is being said which might be the truth we must be able to be open and vulnerable in following the thoughts of another person as sincerely deeply and imaginatively as we can
8093929 like people or dogs each day is unique and has its own personality quirks which can easily be seen if you look closely but there are so few days as compared to people not to mention dogs that it would be surprising if a day were not a hundred times more interesting than most people but usually they just pass mostly unnoticed unless they are wildly nice like autumn ones full of red maple trees and hazy sunlight or if they are grimly awful ones in a winter blizzard that kills the lost traveler and bunches of cattle for some reason we like to see days pass even though most of us claim we dont want to reach our last one for a long time we examine each day before us with barely a glance and say no this isnt one ive been looking for and wait in a bored sort of way for the next when we are convinced our lives will start for real meanwhile this day is going by perfectly well adjusted as some days are with the right amounts of sunlight and shade and a light breeze scented with a perfume made from the mixture of fallen apples corn stubble dry oak leaves and the faint odor of last nights meandering skunk
8093930 we are tendencies who tend to think we are not tendencies
8093931 i pursue no objectives no system no tendency i have no program no style no directions i have no time for specialized concerns working themes or variations that lead to mastery i steer clear of definitions i dont know what i want i am inconsistent non committal passive i like continual uncertainty other qualities may be conducive to achievement publicity success but they are all outworn as outworn as ideologies opinions concepts and names for things
8093932 the more you study the further you get from the way
8093933 if i dont study it how can i know it
8093934 the way does not belong to things seen nor to things unseen it does not belong to things known nor to things unknown do not seek it study it or name it to find yourself on it open yourself as wide as the sky
8093935 each thing is preaching the dharma incessantly but this is not something different from the thing itself haiku is the revealing of this preaching by presenting us with the thing devoid of all our mental twisting and emotional discolouration or rather it shows the thing as it exists at one and the same time outside and inside the mind perfectly subjective ourselves undivided from the object the object in its original unity with ourselves it is a way of returning to nature to our moon nature our cherry blossom nature our falling leaf nature in short to our buddha nature it is a way in which the cold winter rain the swallows of evening even the very day in its hotness and the length of the night become truly alive share in our humanity speak their own silent and expressive language
8093936 what is important is to keep our mind high in the world of true understanding and returning to the world of our daily experience to seek therein the truth of beauty no matter what we may be doing at a given moment we must not forget that it has a bearing upon our everlasting self which is poetry
8093937 one cannot make good haiku simply by going about ones life in a day to day fashion it is necessary to hone ones senses to the world around one and take an interest in all things great and small
8093938 to understand and begin to use language that directly knows and expresses the universe you must shake the mud of words and concepts off your feet and walk freely right through the very center of words not eschewing language not dependent upon it actually language expresses the meaning of existence as the universe just as wonderfully well as birdsong does or the movement of the branches shaken by a spring wind or the chewed bone left under the bushes by the dog but to hear its real expression you cannot be caught by words and phrases
8093939 i have been with you master for a long time and yet i am unable to understand your way how is this
8093940 where you do not understand there is the point for your understanding
8093941 every morning i jump out of bed and step on a landmine the landmine is me after the explosion i spend the rest of the day putting the pieces together
8093942 if you are a person of gain and loss youve already lost its a matter of remembering that our business here is to learn to love all the way through to letting go theres nothing much else we can actually do with the overwhelming opportunity of a human life which is shaped exactly like completely accepting the offer of a lifetime and shaped exactly like finally letting go
8093943 amid all the turmoil and the care the worry the fever the anxiety the gloomy outlook fears forebodings the effort to keep up with the rush of supposed necessities supposed duties the effort to catch the flying point of light to reach the haven of peace always in the future amid all glides in the little word now
8093944 first i went following the scented grasses then came back following the fallen flowers
8093945 it is better than the autumn dew falling on the lotus flowers
8093946 our condition is not a regrettable accidental interruption of holiness it is holiness it is it the blade of this life is so keen and sharp it wounds
8093947 everything is always falling out of balance against a background of perfect harmony
8093948 the pathologies of a lay life relate to a kind of getting lost a forgetting of the quest an unconscious immersion in the world
8093949 we normally have the idea that if we are in hell this is a bad thing and well have to spend a long time with a shovel digging our way out
8093950 no need to survive no need to survive hell either
8093951 it is the secret of the world that all things subsist and do not die but only retire a little from sight and afterwards return again nothing is dead men feign themselves dead and endure mock funerals and mournful obituaries and there they stand looking out of the window sound and well in some new strange disguise jesus is not dead he is very well alive nor john nor paul nor mahomet nor aristotle at times we believe we have seen them all and could easily tell the names under which they go
8093952 it is not a matter of sadness that things come and go if it were a matter of sadness the universe would be filled with nothing but a bunch of sadsacks but the universe is filled with joy and sorrow laughter and tears dancing and smiling sunshine and rain moment after moment birth and death death and birth birthdeath deathbirth none of it would be possible without you or me but me and you are nothing but moment after moment
8093953 if you search for your awakened heart if you put your hand through your rib cage and feel for it there is nothing there except tenderness you feel sore and soft and if you open your eyes to the rest of the world you feel tremendous sadness this kind of sadness doesnt come from being mistreated you dont feel sad because someone has insulted you or because you feel impoverished rather this experience of sadness is unconditioned it occurs because your heart is completely exposed the genuine heart of sadness comes from feeling that your nonexistent heart is full
8093954 when we dare to accept and really meet our own narrowness of being just as it is without moving toward or away and without adding a single defense then the very constriction in our lives subtly opens as its own way through
8093955 one day you realize or admit that you are imperfect it finally sinks in that you are not who you thought you were you begin to feel terrible about not being perfect your self esteem descends to new lows your feelings hover over you like a low pressure weather system in addition to feeling imperfect you now also feel depressed and defeated you have added one suffering on top of another depression on top of imperfection because you have encountered another one of the great obstacles to spiritual work the difficulty we have with simply suffering and with suffering in a simple way
8093956 we are waiting for the seasons to change we are waiting for our time to come around or that opening to appear in the tao where we can walk through and touch somebody whereas if we had moved before everything would have been wrong no point no effect sometimes the right thing to do is to wait in the hexagram in the i ching about waiting it says you should enjoy yourself with this kind of waiting you should eat and drink and be of good cheer we do not need to be dour about waiting because we are in tune with the seasons it is the right time to wait
8093957 being ignorant means not knowing the true nature of the self obscuring our natural and innate correspondence with everything that is and drawing a sharp line between self and other
8093958 human beings have a tendency to live in their heads this phrase covers several facts first men have a tendency to overtheorize some things are ruined by too much thinking on them things which are essentially matters of experience what is more almost anything can be the source of immediate experience and so almost anything is vulnerable to ruination by too much theorizing the second fact is this such theorizing usually presents itself phenomenologically as internal verbalization and the internal verbalization often insinuates itself between ourselves and the thing experienced this is how the thinking interrupts experience and how it leaves us with only our verbalizations this leads to the third fact when our theoretical internal verbalization is interposed between ourselves and external things the object of our awareness becomes ourselves it is we who are doing the theorizing and to be aware of the theoretical verbalizing is to be aware of ourselves this state of mind is undesirable for it is a commonplace that our happiest moments come when we are not conscious of ourselves and that most forms of consciousness of self are baneful it is hard to say why this is so perhaps the resources of a self are much more limited than the resources of the world so only an object directed consciousness can satisfy the human appetite for variety
8093959 the thing that blinds us and deafens us is the ceaselessly moving mind the preoccupation we have with our thoughts it is the incessant internal dialogue that shuts out everything else that is the problem with trying to take a preconceived photograph before you even walk out of the building you blind yourself all day long we talk to ourselves we preoccupy ourselves with the past or we preoccupy ourselves with the future and while we preoccupy ourselves we miss the moment and miss our lives looking we do not see it is as if we were blind listening we do not hear it is as if we were deaf loving we do not feel it is as if we were dead preoccupied we do not notice the reality around us how can we be present how can we taste and touch our lives the answer to these questions is not outside yourself to see this truth requires the backward step going very deep into yourself to find the foundation of reality and of your life to see it is not the same as understanding it or believing it to see it means to realize it with the whole body and mind to realize it transforms ones life ones way of perceiving the universe and the self and of expressing what has been realized when you practice the zen arts practice your life trust yourself completely trust the process of sitting know that deep within each and every one of us under layers of conditioning there is an enlightened being alive and well in order to function it needs to be discovered to discover this buddha is wisdom to make it function in the world is compassion that wisdom and compassion is the life of each one of us it is up to you what you do with it
8093960 the things we really need come to us only as gifts and in order to receive them as gifts we have to be open
8093961 in precisely the same way you are both what you do and what happens to you you have a little game in which you play that you are not responsible for what happens to you you are only responsible for what you do this illusion allows you to compete with the two sides of yourself it is like getting two knitting pins one in each hand and having a fencing match with yourself if you sincerely try to stick one hand with the other the first hand must really try to stick the other just to defend itself you will come to a sort of standstill unless you decide that your right hand is the one that is going to win and then you have broken the rules of the game which is what we do all the time
8093962 there are always moments when one feels empty and estranged such moments are most desirable for it means the soul has cast its moorings and is sailing for distant places this is detachment when the old is over and the new has not yet come if you are afraid the state may be distressing there is really nothing to be afraid of remember what ever you come across go beyond
8093963 all my life i have been contemplating a question of heideggers that has always struck me as strangely profound why is there something why not rather nothing have you ever thought about that we take our life we take life we take existence for granted we take it as a given and then we complain that it isnt working out as we wanted it to but why should we be here in the first place why should we exist at all why should anything exist at all really theres no reason for it why not nothing rather than something nothing would be simpler
8093964 you realize that prayer takes us beyond the law when you are praying you are in a certain sense an outlaw there is no law between the heart and god
8093965 well ive seen quite a bit lets spice it up lets have a little adventure
8093966 tonight i am going to dream in such a way that i dont know that im dreaming
8093967 you could find that courses of action appear to you out of nowhere just the way the next moment does your navigation could unfold by itself and the universe might provide the beauty and happiness you seek when you forget your carefully assembled fiction of who you are you can find a natural delight in people in the planet the stones and the trees there is no observable limit to this beauty and no one is excluded from it then if you are fighting an enemy you may be fighting them as well as you can but you wont be a true believer you will know that an enemy is not truly other and that the fighting is some kind of misunderstanding the worries that lead to quarrels may still be present but they are not the main thing your problems could be a kind of dream very powerful when you are in it and yet a dream you might notice that even deep in dreaming you are near to waking up and the more you are awake the kinder the world might seem
8093968 nature is a temple where from living pillars confused words are sometimes allowed to escape here man passes through forests of symbols which watch him with looks of recognition
8093969 as a single footstep will not make a path on the earth so a single thought will not make a pathway in the mind to make a deep physical path we walk again and again to make a deep mental path we must think over and over the kind of thoughts we wish to dominate our lives
8093970 i would like you to be zorba the greek and gautama the buddha together simultaneously less than that wont do zorba represents the earth with all its flowers and greenery and mountains and rivers and oceans and buddha represents the sky with all its stars and clouds and rainbows but the sky without the earth will be empty the sky cannot laugh without the earth and the earth without the sky will be dead bring both together and a dance comes into existence the earth and the sky dancing together and there is laughter there is joy there is celebration
8093971 i am trying to check my habits of seeing to counter them for the sake of greater freshness i am trying to be unfamiliar with what im doing
8093972 far from offering a path to transcend the material world zen endeavors to open up to the material world by entering it fully once you enter the material world completely the teachings imply its depths will be revealed the material world is not just the material world it is not what we think it is in fact the zen masters show us the material world is not as spiritual practitioners might initially imagine in and of itself superficial whats superficial is our habitual view of it to see the material world as it really is is to recognize its non difference from the highest spiritual truths zen training is the effort to learn to enter the material world at such a depth and to appreciate it
8093973 mountains should be climbed with as little effort as possible and without desire the reality of your own nature should determine the speed if you become restless speed up if you become winded slow down you climb the mountain in an equilibrium between restlessness and exhaustion then when youre no longer thinking ahead each footstep isnt just a means to an end but a unique event in itself this leaf has jagged edges this rock looks loose from this place the snow is less visible even though closer these are things you should notice anyway to live only for some future goal is shallow its the sides of the mountain which sustain life not the top heres where things grow
8093974 two chinese monks seppo and ganto while on a pilgrimage were trapped in a snowstorm by sheer good luck there was an inn nearby where they were able to take shelter and wait out the storm
8093975 how can you just go to sleep arent we supposed to be on a pilgrimage
8093976 its been a long cold journey whats wrong with taking a nap in front of the fire
8093977 ive never had the big enlightenment experience ive been searching for in my practice i cant afford to waste a moment
8093978 dont you know that a family heirloom isnt something that arrives one day through the front door its what youve had in your possession all along
8093979 the fearful man objects that life is merciless it is and rightly so for mercy is a quality invented by the human mind to supply the deficiencies of human judgment and of man made law the laws of life are perfect and dispassionately just life reeks not of the individual who either obeys its laws and moves to the ever more or resists the flow and is smashed accordingly if the whole of self be opened with a willingness and yearning to be filled life the superabundant will reply unstintingly but if the gates of self be closed the pressure at the gates will rise and rise until the resister yields at last to the beauty wisdom love that seeks to enter in then will life so fill the form that it will shatter it only to build a palace more commodious and when its gates in turn are closed with selfishness lay siege to them anew not until no self remains that can be filled does the individual cease from suffering only when the resistant self has died for ever can the true self welcome life with joyous heart and ride the river of becoming onward to the shoreless sea
8093980 knowing what will happen in the future we are faced with a simple choice either we resolve not to become attached to people and things or we decide to love them even more fiercely
8093981 we must face the challenge of the future realizing that we are still problems to ourselves where the religious dimension enters in is not just in pious clich s but in a radical self criticism and openness and a profound ability to trust not only in our chances of a winning gamble but in an inner dynamism of life itself a basic creativity a power of life to win over entropy and death but once again we have to pay attention to the fact that we may formulate this in words and our unconscious death drive may be contradicting us in destructive undertones we dont hear in other words we have all got to learn to be wide open and not get closed up in little tight systems and cliques little coteries of gnostic experts
8093982 peace of mind isnt at all superficial to technical work its the whole thing that which produces it is good work and that which destroys it is bad work the specs the measuring instruments the quality control the final checkout these are all means toward the end of satisfying the peace of mind of those responsible for the work what really counts in the end is their peace of mind nothing else the reason for this is that peace of mind is a prerequisite for a perception of that quality which is beyond romantic quality and classic quality and which unites the two and which must accompany the work as it proceeds the way to see what looks gook and understand the reasons it looks good and to be at one with this goodness as the work proceeds is to cultivate an inner quietness a peace of mind so that goodness can shine through i say inner peace of mind it has no direct relationship to external circumstances it can occur to a monk in meditation to a soldier in heavy combat or to a machinist taking off that last ten thousandth of an inch it involves unself consciousness which produces a complete identification with ones circumstances and there are levels and levels of this identification and levels and levels of quietness quite as profound and difficult of attainment as the more familiar levels of activity the mountains of achievement are quality discovered in one direction only and are relatively meaningless and often unobtainable unless taken together with the ocean trenches of self awareness so different from self consciousness which result from inner peace of mind this inner peace of mind occurs on three levels or understanding physical quietness seems the easiest to achieve although there are levels and levels of this too as attested by the ability of hindu mystics to live buried alive for many days mental quietness in which one has no wandering thoughts at all seems more difficult but can be achieved but value quietness in which one has no wandering desires at all but simply performs the acts of his life without desire that seems the hardest ive sometimes thought this inner peace of mind this quietness is similar to if not identical with the sort of calm you sometimes get when going fishing which accounts for much of the popularity of this sport just to sit with the line in the water not moving not really thinking about anything not really caring about anything either seems to draw out the inner tensions and frustrations that have prevented you from solving problems you couldnt solve before and introduced ugliness and clumsiness into your actions and thoughts
8093983 shall we liken christmas to the web in a loom there are many weavers who work into the pattern the experience of their lives when one generation goes another comes to take up the weft where it has been dropped the pattern changes as the mind changes yet never begins quite anew at first we are not sure that we discern the pattern but at last we see that unknown to the weavers themselves something has taken shape before our eyes and that they have made something very beautiful something which compels our understanding
8093984 i was a little lonely at the edges so i packed myself off to do soji
8093985 you are but an appearance and not absolutely the thing you appear to be
8093986 what we call i is just a swinging door which moves when we inhale and when we exhale when we become truly ourselves we just become a swinging door and we are purely independent of and at the same time dependent upon everything
8093987 we are all creative artists of life our physical bodies being the artists material canvas clay with our nerves thoughts feelings and senses i e the personality components comprising both the material on which and the instruments with which the person molds his creative genius into conduct behaviour forms of action and life itself with his life reflecting every image he creates out of the in exhaustive source of the unconscious with every deed expressing originality creativity and the artists living personality the artist of life is that man who is master of himself wherever he may be found behaving truly to himself
8093988 it is conceivable that the artist might once again be completely integrated in society as he was in the middle ages
8093989 what one seems to want in art in experiencing it is the same thing that is necessary for its creation a self forgetful perfectly useless concentration
8093990 what do drawings mean to me i really dont know the activity absorbs me i forget everything else in a way that i dont think happens with any other activity
8093991 the mind itself is an art object it is a mondrian canvas onto whose homemade grids it fits its own preselected products our knowledge is contextual and only contextual ordering and invention coincide we call their collaboration knowledge
8093992 we are all in some way instruments and we all have to be virtuosos at taking a back seat when necessary way back the prayer life of a flexible instrument cannot be well ordered it has to be terribly free and utterly responsive to a darkly dimly understood command
8093993 keep alive within you and under wise control that courage which makes you long to undertake great works which others might consider it folly to attempt
8093994 artists and philosophers have long been faced with the problem of what is expressed in a work of art or put in another way what is created in a work of art at the beginning of this century many western artists found traditional answers to this problem unsatisfactory being disturbed by the difficulty in pinpointing meaning as felt by different audiences the same work of art they found was likely to instill quite different feelings in any two audiences both of which may be opposite to the artists intention the question then arises who is right is anyone right
8093995 why do you continue to save the scorpion when you know its nature is to sting
8093996 the best approach is existentialist and the existentialist approach in theology is not through abstract dogmas but through direct personal confrontation not of a subject with an object but of a person with an inner demand
8093997 sometimes i enter the ultimate state and offer profound discussion simply wishing for you all to be steadily intimate in your mind sometimes within the gates and gardens of the monastery i offer my own style of practical instruction simply wishing you all to disport and play freely with spiritual penetration i spring quickly leaving no trace simply wishing you all to drop off body and mind sometimes i enter the samadhi of self fulfillment simply wishing you all to trust what your hands can hold what would go beyond these scrubbed clean by the dawn wind the night mist clears dimly seen the blue mountains form a single line
8093998 the mountains and rivers of this moment are the actualization of the way of the ancient buddhas each abiding in its own phenomenal expression realizes completeness because mountains and waters have been active since before the eon of emptiness they are alive at this moment because they have been the self since before form arose they are liberated and realized
8093999 the blue mountains are constantly walking if you have doubts about the walking of mountains it means you do not yet know the walking of your own self it is not that your self does not walk but that you do not yet know have not made clear its walking and those who would know their own walking must also know the walking of the blue mountains
8094000 dogens view of the natural world sees it not simply as empty dharmas but as the expression or embodiment of a sacred order that sees the mountains and rivers of this apparent world as participating in or communicating with higher realms hidden from view in the heavens and beyond as conscious processes of the living cosmic body the walking and talking of mountains and rivers become more than metaphors the mountains do not merely walk they have their own way of life their way of life is their investigation of their own walking their study of themselves in studying themselves mountains become buddhas mountains and rivers become wise men and sages
8094001 you should know that fundamentally you do not lack unsurpassed enlightenment and you are replete with it continuously but you may not realize it and be in the habit of arousing discriminatory views and regard them as real without noticing you miss the great way and your efforts will be fruitless such discriminatory views create flowers of emptiness
8094002 one ought not doubt that the mountains walk simply because they may not appear to stride like humans
8094003 the forms by which men and women are haunted are far more diverse and subtle than we knew
8094004 i do not know whether writing ghost stories is a mistake
8094005 walk through your days as a creature with folded wings conscious of the possession of another element and your ability to enter it
8094006 in my experience you always think you know what youre doing you always think you can explain but you always discover years later that you didnt and you couldnt
8094007 when the soul wishes to experience something she throws an image of the experience out before her and enters into her own image
8094008 when we are alone on a starlit night when by chance we see the migrating birds in autumn descending on a grove of junipers to rest and eat when we see children in a moment when they are really children when we know love in our own hearts or when like the japanese poet basho we hear an old frog land in a quiet pond with a solitary splash at such times the awakening the turning inside out of all values the newness the emptiness and the purity of vision that make themselves evident provide a glimpse of the cosmic dance
8094009 modern physics then pictures matter not at all as passive and inert but as being in a continuous dancing and vibrating motion whose rhythmic patterns are determined by the molecular atomic and nuclear structures
8094010 the stillness in stillness is not the real stillness only when there is stillness in movement can the spiritual rhythm appear which pervades heaven and earth
8094011 one day joshu was sweeping the ground when a monk asked him
8094012 reality is one single now this now or today is everyday every day is a good day a good day is nothing special is there in the grayness of an ordinary everyday that contains nothing special something very special and might this something very special not itself be everyday
8094013 so we have to be patient with ourselves over and over again we think we need to be somewhere else and we must find the truth right here right now we must find our joy here now how seductive it is the thought of tomorrow we must find our understanding here we must find it here it is always here this is where the grass is green
8094014 every day mind is getting out of bed eating breakfast going to work coming home going to bed it is laughing and crying being anxious and joyful everyday mind is walking and talking sitting down and standing up it is the mind of suffering conflict anger and hatred love and devotion how can everyday mind be the way everyday mind we say is too mundane too ordinary and so we want the opposite we want the magical it is our very search our lust for the miraculous and magical that hides from us the truth that simply to be simply to know i am is already the miracle that we seek everything as it is is perfect but you must stop seeing it as if in a mirror as if in a dream
8094015 knowing who you are is not a mystical thing but a matter of experience acceptance honesty and compassion it is knowing you are small and selfish and angry and great creative tender hearted and caring
8094016 the basic teaching of the buddha is that there is no abiding self our being is made up of and constantly depends upon other people animals plants soil water air the planet earth the other planets the sun moon and stars our very genes are programmes provided to us by our ancestors and from unknown sources back to the earliest green slime and before nothing is my own and everything makes me up my parents grandparents the birdsong portraits by rembrandt the scent of the puakenikeni and the laughter of a friend also forming my being are death in the family the danger of biological holocaust misunderstandings and malicious gossip this formation that is me flowing along eating and adapting and adopting is the same formation that is you with very small variations in our combination of genes and experience that give us our uniqueness this uniqueness is our own personal potential and we depend upon each other for sustenance to fulfill it
8094017 if you are alive you have to be willing to work hard which means being present in your life doing all the things that have to be done to support a life that means eating and cleaning the body and cleaning the house and filling it up with the things it takes to run the house and also cleaning up the world and filling the world with all the things it takes to run the world because you need the world to be there so the house can be there so the body can have a roof over its head in other words what else is there to do anyway but work all the time because thats being alive
8094018 we learn in our guts not just in our brain that a life of joy is not in seeking happiness but in experiencing and simply being the circumstances of our life as they are not in fulfilling personal wants but in fulfilling the needs of life not in avoiding pain but in being pain when it is necessary to do so too large an order too hard on the contrary it is the easy way
8094019 nobody said it was easy to stay in the fire stay alert and forebear but the alternative is to suffer what is anyway but with no true or reliable relationship with it
8094020 human life itself is granted as an extraordinary gift as far as we know one of the rarest gifts that anyone can have anywhere in the universe and everything until this point from the big bang through eons of pure energy then eons of matter then eons of life coming into being life after life after life has yielded to open the way to you and to this moment everything that has ever lived is laying down its life all the way like a great royal road leading exactly to this life this consciousness and this rarest of human chances what a gift if you look into a newborn babys eyes you can see the gift there still so clearly the planets and the stars still turning in the babys eyes everything is given where it comes from nobody knows
8094021 one thing that makes a good koan is that its difficult to get hold of its intriguing and interesting but you cant quite unpack it it doesnt immediately reveal itself to you so your doubt and sense of mystery begins to collect around the koan all our difficulties get poured into the koan which is what it is for it is through this that we open the gate of our own living when we really become one with the koan we begin to enter our own lives so fully that we are no longer ghosts clinging to our old concepts thinking we know how the world works and living through those ideas rather than directly when we understand the fleeting quality of life and theres no way we even wish to change that whatever we hang onto will be snatched away we all know that however much we love it however well we behave even if you practice special breathing exercises it will still be snatched away even if we take homeopathic medicines even if we are made a full partner it will still be snatched away
8094022 as it is said if you want to escape from the clamor in the mind you should read the ancient teaching what is the ancient teaching
8094023 the moon is bright in space the waves are calm on the ocean
8094024 we take a handful of sand from the endless landscape of awareness and call that handful of sand the world
8094025 just watching the cedar wattle fronds move in silvery light and shadow with no thought of anything at all just smelling the sharp scent of rain on warm pavements just stroking the cats fur watching the flames truly nothing is missing every day is full of such moments before and beyond thought these are tiny intimations of the overwhelming wave that breaks as realization and shows you your true face
8094026 there is a tempering that needs to go on an acknowledgment of our vulnerability and all the things that we dont know
8094027 there is so very much in this directly challenging and yet starkly simple question how am i living right now am i really willing to examine this continuously when getting up in the morning showering going to the cushion fixing breakfast helping get the kids ready for school relating to my partner and to whatever reactivity arises from how she or he relates to me when life presents me with what i want and when it offers up what i most definitely do not want and so on what do i plan to do with this how am i meeting living this
8094028 for the meaning of life differs from man to man from day to day and from hour to hour what matters therefore is not the meaning of life in general but rather the specific meaning of a persons life at a given moment
8094029 the real being with no status is always going in and out through the doors of your face
8094030 what i point out to you is only that you shouldnt allow yourselves to be confused by others act when you need to without further hesitation or doubt people today cant do this what is their affliction their affliction is in their lack of self confidence if you do not spontaneously trust yourself sufficiently you will be in a frantic state pursuing all sorts of objects and being changed by those objects unable to be independent
8094031 we reach the gate that cannot be passed the gate of impassibility completely frustrated
8094032 writing for me is a kind of daily practice even if you dont have anything to say you keep your hand in thats the journal just jotting something down observations of the eternal weather thoughts and words can drift through you but once you write them down theyve arrived and when something beautiful arrives you want to have enough coordination to transcribe it
8094033 if you find it difficult to be aware then experiment with writing down every thought and feeling that arises throughout the day write down your reactions of jealousy envy vanity sensuality the intentions behind your words and so on if you write these things down whenever you can and in the evening before sleeping look over all that you have written during the day study and examine it without judgment without condemnation you will begin to discover the hidden causes of your thoughts and feelings desires and words now the important thing in this is to study with free intelligence what you have written down and in studying it you will become aware of your own state in the flame of self awareness of self knowledge the causes of conflict are discovered and consumed you should continue to write down your thoughts and feelings intentions and reactions not once or twice but for a considerable number of days until you are able to be aware of them instantly meditation is not only constant self awareness but constant abandonment of the self out of right thinking there is meditation from which there comes the tranquillity of wisdom and in that serenity the highest is realized writing down what one thinks and feels ones desires and reactions brings about an inward awareness the cooperation of the unconscious with the conscious and this in turn leads to integration and understanding
8094034 the human mind is a kind of original egg endlessly hatching
8094035 subject and object are to be realized as the two sides of one sheet of paper that is one and yet two the one piece of paper cannot exist without the two sides nor the two sides without the one sheet this analogy fails to satisfy if taken any other way but lightly and quickly for to what should we compare the universe how can anything be a true parable of the essence of being
8094036 there is no dream and no waking up at the heart of the matter no dreamer no closer in or further away states of mind
8094037 to love at all is to be vulnerable love anything and your heart will certainly be wrung and possibly broken if you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give your heart to no one not even to an animal wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries avoid all entanglements lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness but in that casket safe dark motionless airless it will change it will not be broken it will become unbreakable impenetrable irredeemable
8094038 complete attention is itself a kind of love and is one of the true gifts that we can give to one another
8094039 it is not inertia alone that is responsible for human relationships repeating themselves from case to case indescribably monotonous and unrenewed it is shyness before any sort of new unforeseeable experience with which one does not think oneself able to cope but only someone who is ready for everything who excludes nothing not even the most enigmatical will live the relation to another as something alive and will himself draw exhaustively from his own existence for if we think of this existence of the individual as a larger or smaller room it appears evident that most people learn to know only a corner of their room a place by the window a strip of floor on which they walk up and down thus they have a certain security we however are not prisoners we have no reason to mistrust our world for it is not against us has it terrors they are our terrors has it abysses those abysses belong to us our dangers at hand we must try to love them and if only we arrange our life according to that principle which counsels us that we must always hold to the difficult then that which now still seems to us the most alien will become what we most trust and find most faithful how should we be able to forget those ancient myths about dragons that at the last moment turn into princesses perhaps all the dragons of our lives are princesses who are only waiting to see us once beautiful and brave perhaps everything terrible is in its deepest being something helpless that wants help from us
8094040 all great masters are chiefly distinguished by the power of adding a second a third and perhaps a fourth step in a continuous line many a man has taken the first step with every additional step you enhance immensely the value of your first
8094041 remember the punishment for being good is a life of goodness
8094042 the egoless hard to trust they know what should be cherished and kept the egotistical they like too much regardless of content what is theirs i admire whitmans ego capacious but not big shouldnt ego be cultivated until its at least personality maybe then as some have counseled we could give it up or keep it from getting in the way divestiture whitmans the model something of him and what he accumulated and made for us therell always be jibes from those who equate ego with a rampant vainglorious i therell always be the cynics who make less of more let them have less i say all this knowing many of us have selves divided fragments everywhere at best a little cutting a little paste
8094043 certainty is what we feel when we know a little less than enough its only about uninteresting things that we can be wholly certain this is a refrigerator for example or thats a plum if some philosophers want to worry about these designations im quite certain a plum is a plum if it were called say a trampoline id know it was the same tasty thing about matters of the heart only negative capability will do about real time and imaginary time let the dreamer meet the physicist for a friendly duel the world of intellect inseparable from the world of feeling thats a certainty its how it feels
8094044 what we dont know chains us leaves us sitting in the valley with a stupid smile we discover our ignorance as we go after a lifetime if weve been attentive we should fall to our knees before the vastness the ungraspable minutiae of our world we should suspect that it constitutes our god and we so called experts of this or that could we have done more than play our one chord wisdom is to know at best that we make only a little good noise a few small dents its why the wise laugh a lot why the laughter of metaphysicians echoes in the spaces they probe we walk out of our houses into the enormity of our task what kind of ant is that who named the phlox is that a path or a rut
8094045 we often talk about people as if they have particular attributes as
8094046 i dont actually teach self acceptance i encourage people to see that the things they believe about themselves are not true when you see through all that you have been taught to believe when you realize who you are self acceptance becomes irrelevant
8094047 he was beginning to emerge from the dark defile in truth he had already come through it more than once and would come out of it again treatises devoted to the souls ordeal were mistaken in assigning successive phases to that adventure on the contrary all its phases were intermingled everything was subject to infinite restatement and repetition the soul turned about in a circle in its quest long ago in basel and in many other places he had passed through this same long night the same verities had been learned and relearned several times but the experience was cumulative the pace gradually became surer the eye could see farther through certain shadows the mind was at least becoming aware of certain laws like a man who is climbing or perhaps descending a mountainside he was rising or ascending in place at best at each turning the same abyss would open below him sometimes on the right sometimes at his left the gain in actual ascent was measurable only as the air became more rarefied and as new peaks appeared behind those which had seemed to bar the horizon but the notion of ascension or descent was wrong for stars burn below as on high he was neither at the bottom of the gulf nor at its center the abyss was both beyond the celestial sphere and within the human skull everything seemed to be taking place within an infinite series of curves closing in on themselves
8094048 i wont tell him im a city cop and run a harem that smuggles drugs
8094049 looked a lot like debbie reynolds and was real pretty
8094050 in the willing not doing of the impossible the impossible is achieved everything is will everything is subjective stop thinking about the why and wherefore of life cease wanting this and not wanting that it is foolish to fear death all your life and die anyway at the end of it dont read the philosophers and the sages and saints or try to solve all the zen problems the meaning of mu and of the sound of the clapping of one hand and all that nonsense be free of them and of all things so that you can play the piano nonchalantly and incompetently before an audience of ten thousand and be buried alive with equanimity and boredom
8094051 any reflective person recognizes how much learning happens outside the realm of analytical deduction most of what one knows comes from sensory intuitive and imaginative faculties reason may later examine and organize this learning but one first assimilated it holistically
8094052 in essence that just about sums up what we know about learning attending to information constructing meaning and lodging it in our memory brain researchers have shown that emotions are critical to patterning which is the way that information is organized in the brain how we are able to retrieve that information emotions assist in both evaluating and integrating information and experiences however as we know not all emotions facilitate learning stress frustration anger fear all can overwhelm the brain with hormones and thought patterns that totally shut down ones ability to learn when major emotional flooding occurs it is true that one literally cannot think straight
8094053 in the old days evil things spread rapidly but now good things spread rapidly if you understand everything begins to appear wonderful and beautiful and it naturally makes people stop wasting or stop desiring unnecessary things this awakening is contagious and it will be transmitted to everybody soon
8094054 those with eyes lead those with eyes those who have none lead the blind all lead all are led the expression the blind leading the blind comes from the nirvana sutra
8094055 come back when there is nobody around and i shall tell you
8094056 see how long these are see how short these are
8094057 the glaring contrast between seeing and looking at the world around us is immense it is fateful
8094058 they know not what they do for they do not see what they look at
8094059 i am a poor candidate for a zen life and yet there is nothing quite so total as being completely tuned into the present to the moment how you get it really doesnt matter human beings are complicated you can live in the past you can dream all the time of the future but every now and again you need to be right there but its hard because most of the modern world isnt worth paying attention to who wants to pay attention to the traffic jam on i 10 the more you live in the suburbs or urban areas the more you want to shut everything down see little hear little smell nothing who wants it who needs it the total sensory experience of living in a shithouse when you walked by a period of life when you could have been really happy you should have seized it you should have leaped upon it i just try to let myself go its not necessary to live in the moment every day in the traffic jam with smog creeping in your window listening to bad rap music on the radio but when its there you have really got to live it the best reason for living it is knowing you are going to die its no big deal i have had some sense of my own mortality for a long time its not a negative thought its just the way things are if you want more life thats fine but you should get as much out of the life that you have got left as you can i wish i had a clue as to how to find happiness but i know it slaps you in the face all of the time you just have to stop long enough to pay attention
8094060 seeing is encountering reality with all of your being to encounter reality deeply you cannot leave part of yourself behind all of your senses your emotions your intellect your language making abilities each contributes to seeing fully
8094061 always be ready to see what you havent seen before its a kind of looking where you dont know what youre looking for
8094062 if it does not face any thing is there or is there not a reflection in the mirror
8094063 that the mirror reflects a thing means that it always mirrors regardless of whether it is facing or not facing a thing
8094064 when you say that it always mirrors how does it mirror
8094065 when i say that the mirror always mirrors it is because a clear transparent mirror possesses an original nature as its essential activity of always mirroring things analogously the mind is originally undefiled and naturally possesses a superb light of wisdom that illuminates the perfect world of nirvana
8094066 seeing is not like something you can call a thing
8094067 if it is not like anything one can call a thing what does it see
8094068 it sees that is the true seeing it always sees
8094069 i will settle something for you right now the ultimate rule is to see your own mind clearly
8094070 the mind does not know itself the mind does not see itself
8094071 is it possible to meet each other or to meet the flower the bird or the new day without anything interfering and if the past does come up to see that it is memory coming up and not be ruled by it not be compelled and narrowed down by it to see it and to wonder whether it has to interfere whether perhaps there is an energy of meeting of listening and looking which can disconnect the belief that we think we know what he she or it is
8094072 buddha is sanskrit for what you call aware miraculously aware responding perceiving arching your brows blinking your eyes moving your hands and feet its all your miraculously aware nature and this nature is the mind and the mind is the buddha and the buddha is the path and the path is zen but the word zen is one that remains a puzzle to both mortals and sages seeing your nature is zen unless you see your nature its not zen
8094073 please master i feel lost desperate i dont know who i am please show me my true self
8094074 the clearest way into the universe is through a forest wilderness
8094075 you find yourself by losing yourself by not thinking about yourself all of the time when i am in a slump with my writing ill go and walk for a week walk and not see a human being something happens after four or five days which is quite wonderful it is an ancient thing your sense of smell your hearing they come back
8094076 buddha means one who has woken up from the dream of self image we cant really understand what waking up is until we wake up we can talk about it but we cant really describe it as such someone who is sleeping might dream about being awake going to work meeting friends and so on but it is a dream so usual mind cannot encompass awakened mind within itself we cant put a big box into a small box only buddha can realize buddha the teachings say that you are buddha it is not a matter of becoming buddha it is a matter of realizing for yourself that you are buddha and that there is a fundamental awakened quality at the core of your experience it is a matter of realizing for yourself that sanity honesty clarity wisdom and compassion are your basic nature that all conditions are inherently unconditioned that awareness is all that is ever going on and it is never limited this means having some sense of being buddha even if only on a feeling or intellectual level a deep sense that no matter how screwed up you can be you are basically sane after all no matter how you might find yourself getting caught up in things there is still a basic clarity thats available to you
8094077 the more we create the more we love and lose those whom we love the more we escape from death with every new work we round and finish we escape into the work we have created the soul we have loved the soul that has left us when all is told rome is not in rome the best of a man lies outside himself
8094078 the artist within must fight the battle for meaning with pen on paper or brush on canvas or chisel in wood and stone but his way as that of everyman leads from ignorance delusion folly self inflation and phoniness to truth and authenticity the point of practicing an art is less to discover who you are than to become your truth to be able to shed all sham imposture and bluff in relation to yourself and others true art is not an indulgence of the little self but a manifestation of the self
8094079 one spring as peach blossoms filled the valley below with a spray of white fragrance an ancient sage wandered the heights of shang
8094080 this indeed is a tree good for nothing that is why it has reached so great an age the cinnamon tree can be eaten so it is cut down the varnish tree is useful and therefore incisions are made in it we all know the advantage of being useful but only this tree knows the advantage of being useless
8094081 as long as you are conscious of yourself you can never concentrate on anything
8094082 how does the bodhisattva of great compassion use so many hands and eyes
8094083 its just like a person in the middle of the night reaching back in search of a pillow
8094084 what you said is all right but its only eighty percent of it
8094085 im like this senior brother how do you understand it
8094086 youre the only one who knows when youre using things to protect yourself and keep your ego together and when youre opening and letting things fall apart letting the world come as it is working with it rather than struggling against it youre the only one who knows
8094087 misery and joy have the same shape in this world you may call the rose an open heart or a broken heart
8094088 consider that virtually everything we do is easily recognizable as being our own the way we walk down a street the way we write our signature the way we pick up the telephone for example there is in buddhism a teaching which intimates that you can learn a lot about someone from the way they go about sweeping a room do they do it in a wild fashion dust flying everywhere or do they go about it more calmly and methodically sweeping a room may seem far removed from what is usually thought of as the spiritual life but it is shrewd to make this connection every act is built upon all that has gone before and even the way we approach a simple task is likely to reflect our deepest and most subjective patterns all the hopes and fears that go to make us what we are
8094089 and this do i call immaculate perception of all things to want nothing else from them but to be allowed to lie before them as a mirror with a hundred facets
8094090 we are fragmented into so many different aspects we dont know who we really are or what aspects of ourselves we should identify with or believe in so many contradictory voices dictates and feelings fight for control over our inner lives that we find ourselves scattered everywhere in all directions leaving nobody at home
8094091 mindfulness works like an electron microscope that is it operates on so fine a level that one can actually see directly those realities which are at best theoretical constructs to the conscious thought process mindfulness actually sees the impermanent character of every perception it sees the transitory and passing nature of everything that is perceived it also sees the inherently unsatisfactory nature of all conditioned things it sees that there is no sense grabbing onto any of these passing shows peace and happiness just cannot be found that way and finally mindfulness sees the inherent selflessness of all phenomena it sees the way we have arbitrarily selected a certain bundle of perceptions chopped them off from the rest of the surging flow of experience and then conceptualized them as separate enduring entities mindfulness actually sees these things it does not think about them it sees them directly
8094092 what is common to all human beings in all history is problems problems problems we are here for problem solving and if you are any good at problem solving you dont come to utopia you come to more difficult problems to solve that apparently is what were here for so i therefore conclude that we humans are here for local information gathering and local problem solving with our minds having access to the design principles of the universe we are here for local information gathering and local universe problem solving in support of the integrity of eternally regenerative universe that is a very extraordinary and important kind of a function we have
8094093 your whole past is like a long sleep which would have been forgotten had there been no memory but remembrance is there in the blood and the blood is like an ocean in which everything is washed away but that which is new and more substantial even than life
8094094 i didnt make the universe i just live in it
8094095 since the business of living has so many barbs in it and since so many of our friends are liars or fools or inarticulate or emotionally blunt or are sucking on us for what they imagine we can give though we cant it is pure joy to read the poems of the truth sayers the simple singers the masters of prayer and devotion and the crazed wise babblers of ecstasy the high mind singers to no end
8094096 i think when we get those moments where things are just too hard to comprehend there is a whole different world
8094097 and now advice for beginning mystics be sober be intelligent be educated rely on the tangible reality as long as you can remember that the act of writing is a tiny part of a bigger something defend the value of the spiritual experience and if somebody tells you its an old fashioned notion laugh loudly and serenely
8094098 the secret of the mountains is that the mountains simply exist as i do myself yet the mountains exist simply which i do not the mountains have no meaning they are meaning the mountains are i ring with life and the mountains ring and when i can hear it it is a ringing we share i understand all this in my heart knowing how meaningless it is to try to capture what cannot be expressed knowing that only words will remain when i read it again another day
8094099 we dont really have any mind at all we think we have a mind we think we have this thing called
8094100 we write to understand thus we should write but we can never fully understand the world is shifting and we are shifting under it thus we should keep writing
8094101 only to a magician is the world forever fluid infinitely mutable and eternally new only he knows the secret of change only he knows truly that all things are crouched in eagerness to become something else and it is from this universal tension that he draws his power
8094102 why fret away your life see the willow tree by the river there it is watching the water flow by
8094103 it has been said that if you could become another person for even a few moments you would probably become enlightened so strong is our attachment to the idea of who we are that even the smallest jolt out of it can have an immense effect
8094104 one superfluous human being in the midst of all and everything humankind history literature the infinite universe is attempting to talk back in a dozen or so lines of poetry no wonder people say the poets are nuts the world so big and the poem so teeny
8094105 one purpose of poetry is to give us words to articulate our joys and sorrows without revealing them
8094106 it is the nature of things which is speaking with the voice of a man
8094107 poetry was born from magic it grew up with religion it survived the age of reason how is it to continue to be heard in the pandemonium of slogans loud speakers madhouse slanders high explosive fears that seem to diffuse man in complexities of environment outrunning his capacity to grasp
8094108 something arises which pleases the mind which fits in with our notion of what is profitable for us and we love it something arises which thwarts us which conflicts with our wants and we hate it so long as we possess this individual mind enlightenment and delusion pain and pleasure accepting and rejecting good and bad toss us up and down on the waves of existence never moving onwards always the same restlessness and wobbling the same fear of woe and insecurity of joy
8094109 our state of mind is not to be fatalistic saying of bad things
8094110 thought has nowhere to go but its own isolated endless fragmented repetition without the obsession of thought we are the recognition and the expression of the energy of consciousness and space in which we and others coexist in such profound contact that there is nothing that definitively divides us
8094111 how can there be such a thing as pointing without a finger how can art subsist without a medium what is this silence that speaks so loudly
8094112 first be quiet by the way notice that i said be quiet i did not say think quiet
8094113 practice mental silence instead of trying to activate cosmic powers within we should remain silent in order to see them already at work make it your task for today not to try to achieve anything but to quietly watch yourself being moved about by inner forces
8094114 once inner silence is attained everything is possible the way to stop talking to ourselves is to use exactly the same method used to teach us to talk to ourselves we were taught compulsively and unwaveringly and this is the way we must stop it compulsively and unwaveringly
8094115 everything in life is speaking in spite of its apparent silence
8094116 we may be in the universe as dogs and cats are in our libraries seeing the books and hearing the conversation but having no inkling of the meaning of it all
8094117 you know quite well deep within you that there is only a single magic a single power a single salvation and that is called loving well then love your suffering do not resist it do not flee from it it is your aversion that hurts nothing else
8094118 of course there can be desire without love desire isnt passion desire is the natural consequence of the sexual instinct and it isnt of any more importance than any other function of the human animal
8094119 love is an act of endless forgiveness a tender look which becomes a habit
8094120 sometimes your joy is the source of your smile but sometimes your smile is the source of your joy
8094121 the aim of life its only aim is to be free free of what free to do what only to be free that is all free through ourselves free to be sad to be in pain free to grow old and die this is what our soul desires and this freedom it must have and shall have
8094122 the sun shines not on us but in us the rivers flow not past but through us thrilling tingling vibrating every fiber and cell of the substance of our bodies making them glide and sing
8094123 according to some ancient indian poets the essential quality of beauty is that it remains from moment to moment ever new since every new experience compels a fresh modification of character it might be possible to describe beauty not only as that which is always new but also as that which far from allowing us the luxury of remaining satisfied with ourselves as we are demands from moment to moment a fresh transformation of our lives
8094124 beauty is merciless you do not look at it it looks at you and does not forgive
8094125 they arise spontaneously the principles of all things water need not think to offer itself as a home for clear moonlight
8094126 sometimes i look at something and i think its so wonderful and then i realize i was pointing out a fact that was as obvious as the moon
8094127 if the book we are reading does not wake us as with a fist hammering on our skull why then do we read so that it shall make us happy good god we should also be happy if we had no books and such books as make us happy we could if need be write ourselves but what we must have are those books which come upon us like ill fortune and distress us deeply like the death of one we love better than ourselves like suicide a book must be an ice axe to break the sea frozen inside us
8094128 in the reading room of the new york public library that mausoleum designed by some schoolmaster with memories of hard oak dust and gloom there are men who sit day after day bulwarked by stacks of books scribbling scribbling in the little pools of light from the green shaded lamps on the long oak tables and you look at them and wonder what will o the wisps they are pursuing day after day year after year
8094129 these are books that no one has opened for twenty years fifty years eighty years and when you have written your book it too will gather dust
8094130 is it possible that nothing real or important has yet been seen or known or said is it possible that mankind has had thousands of years in which to observe reflect and record and has allowed these millenia to slip past like a recess interval at school in which one eats ones sandwich and an apple yes it is possible
8094131 seventh heaven may be the whole truth of a sixth sense come to pass
8094132 just as some people work because theyre bored i sometimes write because i have nothing to say daydreaming which occurs naturally to people when theyre not thinking in me takes written form for i know how to dream in prose
8094133 the aim of zen is to open the eye of the
8094134 what is zen zen is looking at things with the eye of god that is becoming the things eyes so that it looks at itself with our eyes
8094135 we seek an enlargement of our being we want to be more than ourselves we want to see with other eyes to imagine with other imaginations to feel with other hearts as well as with our own we demand windows
8094136 and now we look upon the earth and sky this spread of naked rock and peaks and moonlight is like a world ready to be born a world that waits it seems to us it asks a sign from us a spark a first commandment we cannot know what word we are to give nor what great deed this earth expects to witness we know it waits it seems to say it has great gifts to lay before us but it wishes a greater gift for us we are to speak we are to give its goal its highest meaning to all this glowing space of rock and sky
8094137 admire the world for never ending on you as you would admire an opponent without taking your eyes off him or walking away
8094138 however smart we may be however rich and clever or loving or charitable or spiritual or impeccable it doesnt help us at all the real power comes in to us from the beyond life enters us from behind where we are sightless and from below where we do not understand
8094139 theres a belief that thoughts are bad but thoughts are just fish in the river you think a river minds having fish
8094140 the use of blows being struck by the masters staff are not a means of enlightenment not merely a mode of the teachers sadism and the learners masochism
8094141 even if our efforts of attention seem for years to be producing no result one day a light that is in exact proportion to them will flood the soul
8094142 remember that self is illusive at best not all parts of the self can be reflected in a single moment but rather over time in flowing movement the more fragmented or fractured our experience in the world the more disjointed our reflections
8094143 but everything human is fragmented not even plato himself was dressed for the music he spoke of
8094144 one way of spinning this is to say that my daily experience is often spontaneous and exciting not fragmented and intimidating but unpredictable continuously new i may lose track of things or of myself in space my line of thought but instead of getting frustrated i try to see this as the perfect time to stop and figure out what i want or where i am i accept my role in the harlequinade its not so much a matter of making lemonade out of lifes lemons but rather of learning to savor the shock taste texture and aftereffects of a mouthful of unadulterated citrus
8094145 do not judge your own actions or those of others good or bad approve or disapprove of them
8094146 a poet is a poet for such a very tiny bit of his life for the rest he is a human being one of whose responsibilities is to know and feel as much as he can all that is moving around and within him
8094147 always be joyful no matter what you are with happiness you can give a person life every day we must deliberately induce in ourselves a buoyant exuberant attitude toward life in this manner we gradually become receptive to the subtle mysteries around us and if no inspired moments come we should act as though we have them anyway if you have no enthusiasm put up a front act enthusiastic and the feeling will become genuine
8094148 when we go to a medicine person or a healer because we are feeling disheartened dispirited or depressed he or she might ask questions like
8094149 when did you begin finding discomfort in the sweet territory of silence
8094150 to create the painter needs paint brushes and canvas the sculptor wood stone or metal and tools the poet words and a pen and paper or computer the composer sounds notes paper
8094151 this is my head this is my body this is my mind
8094152 to the poet to the philosopher to the saint all things are friendly and sacred all events profitable all days holy all men divine
8094153 attaining buddhahood means attaining manhood being a citizen of the world of double sex besides this shakespearean state it means attaining childhood beast hood flower hood stone hood even word hood and idea hood and place hood and time hood
8094154 an aikido instructor once described to me a test he took for promotion to the next level unbeknownst to him at the time one third of the test was determined by how he entered the hall and sat down before his name was even called what the masters were looking for was whether the student was already in a continuous flow entering the hall or whether he regarded the test as a separate point at which to turn on and impress the teachers
8094155 once you acknowledge suffering there is no end to suffering
8094156 mang gong and zen master kyong ho were walking through a forest and got caught in a sudden downpour
8094157 sunim why do you keep looking up at that rock
8094158 we were made to enjoy music to enjoy beautiful sunsets to enjoy looking at the billows of the sea and to be thrilled with a rose that is bedecked with dew human beings are actually created for the transcendent for the sublime for the beautiful for the truthful and all of us are given the task of trying to make this world a little more hospitable to these beautiful things
8094159 if the concept of consciousness were to fall to science what would happen to our sense of moral agency and free will if conscious experience were reduced somehow to mere matter in motion what would happen to our appreciation of love and pain and dreams and joy if conscious human beings were just animated material objects how could anything we do to them be right or wrong
8094160 through no fault of our own and by dint of no cosmic plan or conscious purpose we have become by the grace of a glorious evolutionary accident called intelligence the stewards of lifes continuity on earth we have not asked for that role but we cannot abjure it we may not be suited to it but here we are
8094161 to me this would be the best way to live to situate yourself within your life in such a way as to feel that your own life was unfolding with the pattern of all of life i suppose this might seem megalomaniacal but i see it as quite humble my life isnt mine it is just life living itself through me i think if you lived your life like that then a lot of what bothers you wouldnt bother you any more and a lot of things that dont bother you now would seem very important very personal
8094162 there is a kind of standing still quality or stalemate in which comments and remarks become unimportant and seeing things as they are becomes the real thing its like a frog sitting in the middle of a big puddle with rain constantly falling on it the frog simply winks its eyes at each raindrop that falls on it but it doesnt change its posture
8094163 life is this simple we are living in a world that is absolutely transparent and the divine is shining through it all the time this is not just a nice story or fable it is true
8094164 it is written all buddhas enter the one straight road to nirvana i still wonder where that road can be
8094165 one day passes and another day comes along and everything happens the same but basically we are so afraid of the brilliance coming at us and the sharp experience of our life that we cant even focus our eyes
8094166 here life goes on even and monotonous on the surface full of lightning of summits and of despair in its depths
8094167 the greatest mystery is not that we have been flung at random between the profusion of matter and of the stars but that within this prison we can draw from ourselves images powerful enough to deny our nothingness
8094168 its very clear to think of karma as action as what happens but when you consider right thought karma is very subtle because its internal karma starts with the thought pattern and has an effect right inside your mind if you say something it clearly affects the people around you any thought that you have is going to affect you so the karma is internal but it will eventually affect others around you because it has affected you
8094169 all men know suffering which is as the mud in which the lotus takes its root all men know the lotus blossom which gazes at the heavens
8094170 i would like to encourage everybody to practice meditation so we can actually see and look more if we dont understand ourselves it will be very difficult to appreciate anything else that goes on in our world and on the whole please cheer up dont analyze too much
8094171 the process of practice is to see through not to eliminate anything to which we are attached
8094172 often it helps to meditate on the image of a pebble thrown into a river how is one helped by the image of the pebble sit down in whatever position suits you best the half lotus or lotus back straight the half smile on your face breathe slowly and deeply following each breath becoming one with the breath then let go of everything imagine yourself as a pebble which has been thrown into a river the pebble sinks through the water effortlessly detached from everything it falls by the shortest distance possible finally reaching the bottom the point of perfect rest you are like a pebble which has let itself fall into the river letting go of everything at the center of your being is your breath you dont need to know the length of time it takes before reaching the point of complete rest on the bed of fine sand beneath the water when you feel yourself resting like a pebble which has reached the riverbed that is the point when you begin to find your own rest you are no longer pushed or pulled by anything if you cannot find joy in peace in these very moments of sitting then the future itself will only flow by as a river flows by you will not be able to hold it back you will be incapable of living the future when it has become the present
8094173 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8094174 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8094175 judge me on the content of my character and not the color of my skin
8094176 theres a famous river koda in xingju that is crossed by many bridges one day jojoza was standing on one of the bridges when three monks approached
8094177 if these two monks werent here you would be at the bottom of the river
8094178 when your vision penetrates through and your use of it is clear you are spontaneously able to turn without freezing up or getting stuck amid all kinds of lightning fast changes and complex interactions and interlocking intricacies
8094179 zen prides itself on being a teaching outside words and letters thus any book of mere writing no matter how elevated or enlightened could not rightly be called essential the essential zen in book form would more likely consist of blank pages a reader fills them in or not for about twelve centuries zen teachers have warned their students away from literary endeavor book learning of any kind has been regarded suspiciously by serious practitioners as a very dim second best to direct experience and yet an enormous and illuminating zen literature has grown up sayings and doings of the ancient chinese masters were originally recorded usually by a faithful student these records were discussed and given out as objects of meditation the renowned koans or spiritual puzzles when zen reached japan and other countries the same thing happened it appears that zen teachers of every age including the present one found delight not only in reading what other masters said and did but in commenting about them and in collecting their comments into books
8094180 whence did the wondrous mystic art arise of painting speech and speaking to the eyes that we by tracing magic lines are taught how to embody and to color thought
8094181 i have learned to be happy where i am i have learned that locked within the moments of each day are all the joys the peace the fibers of the cloth we call life the meaning is in the moment there is no other way to find it you feel what you allow yourself to feel each and every moment of the day
8094182 ordinary people just make the same mistake over and over again
8094183 a teacher is not a teacher on account of infallibility they are a teacher on account of realism the teacher can be realistic about himself just as much as about anything else buddhism is entirely experimental every step is a try and see one if we live at the edge of our understanding then we are always growing
8094184 our experience our deepest experience has taught us something we wish to convey it to others
8094185 master what is the difference between a humanistic monastic system of belief in which wisdom is sought by means of an apparently nonsensical system of questions and answers and a lot of mystic gibberish made up on the spur of the moment
8094186 much as we want to know ourselves we do not really know ourselves do we really want to see ourselves as god sees us or even as our fellow human beings see us could we bear it weak as we are you know that feeling of contentment in which we sometimes go about clothed in it as it were like a garment content with the world and with ourselves we do not want to be given that clear inward vision which discloses to us our most secret faults in the psalms there is that prayer deliver me from my secret sins we do not really know how much pride and self love we have until someone whom we respect or love suddenly turns against us then some sudden affront some sudden offense we take reveals to us in all its glaring distinctness our self love and we are ashamed
8094187 is this world wide web outside or inside of you
8094188 then why are you carrying all those spiders in you
8094189 meditation is when you sit down lets say that and dont do anything poetry is when you get up and do something somewhere weve developed the misconception that poetry is self expression and that meditation is going inward actually poetry has nothing to do with self expression it is the way to be free finally of self expression to go much deeper than that and meditation is not a form of thought or reflection it is a looking at or an awareness of what is there equally inside and outside and then it doesnt make sense anymore to mention inside or outside
8094190 a man woke up and found that hed been robbed
8094191 for me to write is self deprecating and yet i cant quit doing it writing is like the drug i abhor and keep taking the addiction i despise and depend on there are necessary poisons and some are extremely subtle composed of ingredients from the soul herbs collected from among the ruins of dreams black poppies found next to the graves of our intentions the long leaves of obscene trees whose branches sway on the echoing banks of the souls infernal rivers to write is to lose myself yes but everyone loses himself because everything gets lost i however lose myself without any joy not like the river flowing into the sea for which it was secretly born but like the puddle left on the beach by the high tide its stranded water never returning to the ocean but merely sinking into the sand
8094192 the koan has the flavor of something that can be resolved by the intellect but it cannot so it keeps the intellect busy while something else happens then the real change occurs
8094193 when you are in love you know this all of you you are not yourself you have no self the world is a grid of shining correspondences and the correspondences sing like angels you cannot defile them with your intentions you cannot undo that order that is suddenly revealed to you all you can do is become part of it and move in hallowed light your friends make jokes about your absentmindedness your parents tell you youre deluded all the people around ask you to come back to the person they know but you are dead to them the world has no meaning to you everything you once cherished is irrelevant and you are far above it the only truth you know is the truth around you and you know more than that that whatever you love you cannot fail to love you can no more be argued out of your devotion than a compass can be told not to find the north the tides instructed not to follow their moon
8094194 of all the pitfalls in our paths and the tremendous delays and wanderings off the track i want to say that they are not what they seem to be i want to say that all that seems like fantastic mistakes are not mistakes all that seems like error is not error and it all has to be done that which seems like a false step is the next step
8094195 you smile at the absurdity of your dream and feel at the same time that the tissue of those absurdities contains some thought but a thought that is real something that belongs to your true life something that exists and has always existed in your heart it is as if your dream has told you something new prophetic awaited your impression is strong it is joyful or tormenting but what it is and what has been told you all that you can neither comprehend nor recall
8094196 we think with only a small part of the past but it is with our entire past including the original bent of our soul that we desire will and act
8094197 you see dear reader speaking frankly without any intention to offend you are a ramshackle collection of coincidences held together by a desperate and irrational clinging there is no center at all everything depends on everything else your body depends on the environment your thoughts depend on whatever junk floats in from the media your emotions are largely from the reptilian end of your dna your intellect is a chemical computer that cant add up a zillionth as fast as a pocket calculator and even your best side is a superficial piece of social programming
8094198 in nature man must everywhere seek his peculiar territory and climate his best occupation his particular neighborhood in order to cultivate a paradise in idea this is the right system paradise is scattered over the whole earth and that is why it has become so unrecognizable
8094199 you know that idea i came across it somewhere that in ancient peoples the senses were much less specialized than they are now that perception came to them in general massive sensations rather than divided up neatly into five channels that they felt all over so to speak and that all the senses as in an overdose of hashish become one single sense the centralizing of perception in the brain is a recent thing and it might equally well have occurred in any other nervous headquarters of the body say the solar plexus or perhaps never have been localized at all in hysteria patients have been known to read with the finger tips and smell with the heel touch is still all over its only the other four that have got fixed in definite organs there are systems of thought today that still would make the solar plexus the main center and not the brain the word brain you know never once occurs in the ancient scriptures of the world you will not find it in the bible the reins the heart and so forth were what men felt with then every man who thinks for himself and feels vividly finds he lives in a world of his own apart and believes that one day hell come across either in a book or in a person the priest who shall make it clear to him
8094200 how do we learn ive heard it a thousand times without yet fully applying it to my own experience that it is axiomatically the height of delusion to think of one meditation object as superior to any other phenomena are all the same in being fleeting unsatisfying and ungovernable a true meditator notices whatever is happening and lets it go its own way without preferences let come whatever comes let go of all that goes im still working on that one
8094201 we do not play the game of black and white the universal game of up down on off solid space and each all instead we play the game of white versus black for especially when rates of vibration are slow as with day and night or life and death we are forced to be aware of the black negative aspect of the world then not realizing the inseparability of the positive and negative poles of the rhythm we are afraid black may win the game but the game white must win is no longer a game it is a fight a fight haunted by a sense of chronic frustration because we are doing something as crazy as trying to keep the mountains and get rid of the valleys
8094202 problems that remain persistently insolvable should always be suspected as questions asked in the wrong way
8094203 some people like zen because it gives them an excuse to be rude some whose heads are not good enough to understand philosophy are glad to hear that zen is against it some people like anything mysterious and exotically esoteric many people want to live calmly not bothered with unimportant or even important things some people have a dogged one track mind and go for zen like a bull terrier some are blind to art and deaf to music dont like sports and never read a book zen gives them an interest in life some want to get rid of an inferiority complex some think it will be useful in business some like to attempt the impossible some people love paradoxes for their own sake
8094204 according to buddhism misery is caused by desire the extinction of desire being followed in a rather unexpected and unexplained way by the bliss of nirvana but how about the desire for virtue the desire for enlightenment the desire to help others the desire for music and for art and for poetry the desire to love even the desire to be loved that caused god to create the universe as for the desire to reform the world to save it this must be the desire to save and reform oneself therefore the more wicked a person is the deeper and stronger must be his repentance and endeavor to rescue the world from its sin we may and indeed must logically suspect people like moses and christ and paul and st augustine and aquinas and mohammed pascal and bunyan and kirkegaard of having had exceedingly bad characters the same must be said of buddha and kukai and shinran and nichiren and of geniuses in other fields euripides and shakespeare milton goethe and wordsworth and shelley and so on i would like to except hakurakuten basho and eckhart and a few others but perhaps this is mere partiality
8094205 one does not become enlightened by imagining light but by making the darkness conscious
8094206 we help keep our lives balanced and sane by being aware of the darkness within us as well as the light so that we are never taken unawares by unconscious negative impulses
8094207 i have been all things unholy if god can work through me he can work through anyone
8094208 we suffer at one and the same time from excessive pride and excessive humility on the one hand our intellect rushes in where angels fear to tread on the other hand we are too humble before the buddhas and saints not realizing that we too are the buddha
8094209 usually when someone believes in a particular religion their attitude becomes more and more a sharp angle pointing away from oneself in our way the point of the angle is always towards ourselves
8094210 if i could stop talking completely cease talking for a year i might begin to get well
8094211 youre searching joe for things that dont exist i mean beginnings ends and beginnings there are no such things there are only middles
8094212 when you consider something like death after which there being no news flash to the contrary we may well go out like a candle flame then it probably doesnt matter if we try too hard are awkward sometimes care for one another too deeply are excessively curious about nature are too open to experience enjoy a nonstop expense of the senses in an effort to know life intimately and lovingly it probably doesnt matter if while trying to be modest and eager watchers of lifes many spectacles we sometimes look clumsy or get dirty or ask stupid questions or reveal our ignorance or say the wrong thing or light up with wonder like the children we all are it probably doesnt matter if a neighbor fetching her mail sees us standing in the cold with our own letters in one hand and a seismically red autumn leaf in the other its color hitting our senses like a blow from a stun gun as we stand with a huge grin too paralyzed by the intricately veined gaudiness of the leaf to move
8094213 are we not complete in ourselves and each in himself life as it is lived suffices it is only when the disquieting intellect steps in and tries to murder it that we stop to live and imagine ourselves to be short of or in something let the intellect alone it has its usefulness in its proper sphere but let it not interfere with the life stream if you are at all tempted to look into it do so while letting it flow the fact of flowing must under no circumstances be arrested or meddled with for the moment your hands are dipped into it its transparency is disturbed it ceases to reflect your image which you have had from the very beginning and will continue to have to the end of time
8094214 you may intend to do something today only for pressing business to come up unexpectedly and take up all of your attention the rest of the day or a person you have been expecting is prevented from coming or someone you hadnt expected comes calling the thing you have counted on goes amiss and the thing you had no hopes for is the only one to succeed a matter which promised to be a nuisance passes off smoothly and a matter which should have been easy proves a great hardship our daily experiences bear no resemblance to what we had anticipated this is true throughout the year and equally true for our entire lives but if we decide that everything is bound to go contrary to our anticipations we discover that naturally there are also some things which do not contradict expectations this makes it all the harder to be definite about anything the one thing you can be certain of is the truth that all is uncertainty
8094215 never underestimate the potential of ego to lead one astray no matter how hard you train or what your point on the path the rush of learning a new skill the flattery that accompanies a touch of success these things can overinflate any persons ego too much praise can do damage just like too much criticism measure a compliment the same as you measure a critique if you think youve arrived somewhere youve got that much farther to go one can lose the way in an instant
8094216 its similar to the process one undergoes when learning to play a musical instrument
8094217 if you can sit quietly after difficult news if in financial downturns you remain perfectly calm if you can see your neighbors travel to fantastic places without a twinge of jealousy if you can happily eat whatever is put on your plate and fall asleep after a day of running around without a drink or a pill if you can always find contentment just where you are you are probably a dog
8094218 learn the rules so that you can break the rules
8094219 the truth is that we live out our lives putting off all that can be put off perhaps we all know deep down that we are immortal and that sooner or later all men will do and know all things
8094220 the unique character of each moment of the present its creative upsurge and its novelty continually escape us there is a key of fundamental importance which allows us to open the inner door which gives access to the plenitude of the present the heavy door which we have ourselves constructed we can even say that it is ourselves its existence is due to our habitual inattention to our constant negligence the most fundamental distractions are not without they are within us they result from the potent magic of words and symbols inseparably connected with all our thoughts
8094221 for most of us there is only the unattended moment the moment in and out of time the distraction fit lost in a shaft of sunlight
8094222 we generally give to our ideas about the unknown the color of our notions about what we do know if we call death a sleep its because it has the appearance of sleep if we call death a new life its because it seems different from life we build our beliefs and hopes out of these small misunderstandings with reality and live off husks of bread we call cakes the way poor children play at being happy but thats how all life is at least thats how the particular way of life generally known as civilization is civilization consists in giving an inappropriate name to something and then dreaming what results from that and in fact the false name and the true dream do create a new reality the object really does become other because we have made it so we manufacture realities we use the raw materials we always used but the form lent it by art effectively prevents it from remaining the same a table made out of pinewood is a pine tree but it is also a table we sit down at the table not at the pine tree
8094223 a work of art which inspires us comes from no quibbling or uncertain man it is the manifest of a very positive nature in great enjoyment and at the very moment the work was done it is not enough to have thought great things before doing the work the brush stroke at the moment of contact carries inevitably the exact state of being of the artist at that exact moment into the work and there it is to be seen and read by those who can read such signs and to be read later by the artist himself with perhaps some surprise as a revelation of himself for an artist to be interesting to us he must have been interesting to himself he must have been capable of intense feeling and capable of profound contemplation he who has contemplated has met with himself is in a state to see into the realities beyond the surface of his subject nature reveals to him and seeing and feeling intensely he paints and whether he wills it or not each brush stroke is an exact record of such as he was at the exact moment the stroke was made
8094224 we are what we pretend to be so we must be careful what we pretend to be
8094225 the bone of his own forehead obstructs his way he knocks himself bloody against his own forehead
8094226 there is a transmission from poet to poet of the spirit of poetry deeply similar to that of zen from monk to monk a poet knows another poet by indubitable yet invisible signs the same is true of the artist and the musician but the poet especially in the wide and profound sense of the word feels and transmits unwittingly that attitude towards life that is the real poetry of the world
8094227 real poetry is to lead a beautiful life to live poetry is better than to write it
8094228 you teach us to just sit when we sit just eat when we eat could a zen master be just angry in the same way
8094229 you mean to just get angry like a thunderstorm and be done when it passes ahh i wish i could do that
8094230 if you never want to see the face of hell when you come home from work every night dance with your kitchen towel and if youre worried about waking up your family take off your shoes
8094231 the importance and unimportance of the self cannot be exaggerated
8094232 in todays world of modern conveniences of cell phones and pagers stealth fighters nuclear submarines electron microscopes and radio telescopes it is sometimes easy to forget that the ability to pursue science unimpeded to let imagination wander where inquiry leads to investigate and reach beyond ourselves is not an entitlement but a right that was fought for as were other rights fought for sometimes to the death this struggle has shaped our history and our souls in it are the seeds that define us as a species it was curiosity not eve that tempted adam
8094233 the really precious things are thought and sight not pace it does a bullet no good to go fast and a man if he be truly a man no harm to go slow for his glory is not at all in going but in being
8094234 after looking at a mountain if we shut our lids and dwell on the scene internally we are led to seize upon its important details the mass of visual information is interpreted and the mountains salient features identified its granite peaks its glacial indentations the mist hovering above the tree line details that we would previously have seen but not for that matter noticed
8094235 we are as forlorn as children lost in the wood when you stand in front of me and look at me what do you know of the griefs that are in me and what do i know of yours and if i were to cast myself down before you and tell you what more would you know about me that you know about hell when someone tells you it is hot and dreadful for that reason alone we human beings ought to stand before one another as reverently as reflectively as lovingly as we would before the entrance to hell
8094236 that which occurs however obscurely at the depths of consciousness before being realized in a work before bringing it out into the open it is necessary to make it traverse an intermediary region between our subconscious and our exterior our intelligence but how to lead it there how to apprehend it
8094237 a miss is as good as a mile the slightest thought of self that is by self and the great way is irretrievably lost a drop of ink and a glass of clear water is all clouded once we think
8094238 the basic premise that the highest truth or first principle or tao is not expressible in words or conceivable through logical thought is common to both taoism and zen both hold moreover that an intuitive understanding of the first principle is possible and this is called enlightenment the enlightened taoist sage is considered to have gained some special knowledge coupled with arcane skills and thus becomes somehow removed from the world but the zen master gains nothing other than the realization that there is nothing to gain and is thus more than ever in the world
8094239 as i told miss okamoto when you go to the kitchen to prepare dinner be born in the kitchen when you finish there die then be born at the dining table as you eat your dinner and when you finish eating die there be born in the garden and sweep with your broom when you get into bed at night die there and when daylight comes and you awaken in your bed be born anew if you have cancer be born with cancer
8094240 the way in which we view something defines for us what were going to allow ourselves to see of it a point of view is merely one degree out of the three hundred and sixty degrees of a circle each point of view can see from that point only and so is three hundred and fifty nine degrees blind when we become fixated on our point of view our interpretations and expectations blind us
8094241 through spontaneity we are re formed into ourselves it creates an explosion that for the moment frees us from handed down frames of reference memory choked with old facts and information and undigested theories and techniques of other peoples findings spontaneity is the moment of personal freedom when we are faced with a reality and see it explore it and act accordingly in this reality the bits and pieces of ourselves function as an organic whole it is the time of discovery of experiencing of creative expression
8094242 a fresh attitude starts to happen when we look to see that yesterday was yesterday and now it is gone today is today and now it is new it is like that every hour every minute is changing if we stop observing change then we stop seeing everything as new
8094243 in the most ordinary terms egolessness is a flexible identity it manifests as inquisitiveness as adaptability as humor as playfulness it is our capacity to relax with not knowing not figuring everything out with not being at all sure about who we are or who anyone else is either
8094244 in the greatest confusion there is still an open channel to the soul it may be difficult to find because by mid life it is overgrown but the channel is always there and it is our business to keep it open to have access to the deepest part of ourselves
8094245 there are joys which long to be ours god sends ten thousand truths which come about us like birds seeking inlet but we are shut up to them and so they bring us nothing but sit and sing awhile upon the roof and then fly away
8094246 why would anyone put their shoulder against a mountain they cant possibly shift why not live in the valley instead and learn day by day who you are why not stay there and explore your potential and how you can best express it
8094247 how can i forget me when everything is designed to remember me to myself
8094248 it may take you many years to find out that the stranger you talked to once for half an hour in the railroad station may have done more to point you to where your true homeland lies than your priest or your best friend or even your psychiatrist
8094249 could it not be simply that we are alone and aimless doomed to wander in an indifferent universe with no hope of salvation nor any prospect except misery death and the empty reality of eternal nothing
8094250 and you wonder why youre not invited to more parties
8094251 whenever someone asked the zen master how he was he would always answer
8094252 sure i do on bad days im okay on good days im also okay
8094253 each of us is aware of far more than we can ever express yet those who can persuade themselves to be guided thus in their pursuit of the totality of truth find themselves rewarded not so much by a surrender of any significant part of the essential mystery as by its transformation into something accessible as living wonder
8094254 there was a time when the loudest sound was the sound of the village chanting weve gone from a world full of sound bird song wind in the trees insects people chanting to a world filled by the noise of machines where we are silent all science tells us that we are resonant if it is a resonant world and we are resonant beings singing and chanting are ways to communicate to exchange ourselves with the world and the voice is the one thing we no longer use
8094255 wherever we may come alive that is the area in which we are spiritual to be vital awake aware in all areas of our lives is the task that is never accomplished but it remains the goal
8094256 to empty oneself is to become oneself to become oneself is thus to go along with the world to go along thus with the world of inevitables is to be free in it therefore to empty oneself is to be free in the world
8094257 go live win and lose smash your hands against hysterical constellations your head against phases of the moon and your heart against another heart find the leisure to contemplate the results you will discover the human condition foolish mortals who say that they seek reality dont know what they are saying for them the worldly when they approach it they tremble and feel weak distressed fearful terrified and repelled they reject the truth and turn somewhere else for it an easier a softer lifeless one little do they realize that they have been through the door itself and in error stupefying ignorance in that immensity said nothing is here and stepped back to dullness they may be less eloquent and merely realize the words it is painful i must stop it and step back
8094258 we live in the aretz in the world and yet in one way or another it is an essential faculty of the human being a mysterious longing which abraham joshua heschel identifies as the root of all our religious practice to yearn for something more we seek the shamayim whether that shamayim is religious or spiritual or purely secular romantic materialistic athletic ideological pharmacological or in any other form this is not only the occupation of the religionists all sensitive women and men are engaged in it whether we are trying to chase our dreams or at least learn what they are to seize the day to pursue pleasure and have fun if that brings lasting joy or simply trying to have a warm life surrounded by a family or other people whom you love anytime we are doing something other than killing time or losing our way we are defining and hopefully chasing what matters we are valuing from the surfer in search of the perfect wave to the guru in the desert we are in a struggle with our own ultimate aretz with the knowledge that within a century or so we will be no more our human existence is conditioned by this polarity this constant wandering between what we are and what we want to be what we know and what we dream we live it every day
8094259 consider this in our everyday state of consciousness we regard our body to be extremely limited whats more we feel that this body is the major source of all our sufferings the feelings of pain arise in the body the fear of illnesses and death are intimately connected to the body etc on the other hand we think bright encouraging thoughts about our minds and our imaginative capabilities whilst the body is weak limited and prone to breaking down easily the mind is sovereign it is our sanctuary and can give us a glimpse of the victory over our humiliating conditions our conscious thoughts seemingly know no bounds we can fantasize to our hearts content about ideal conditions distant lands nice heartwarming events and circumstances we can easily imagine pigs with wings something thats impossible for nature itself to accomplish what can possibly stop our imagination and look its not only idle daydreaming all the achievements that the science technology art and philosophy can boast of all have their origin in our imagination well the experience of enlightenment changes all that strictly speaking it turns things on their heads upon opening our minds eye we see that it is our conscious mind that is extremely limited feeble and prone to easily break down our body which we have despised so much turns out to be the wondrous limitless reality we can go anywhere climb any mountain and hill our body enables us to truly live
8094260 we ourselves are not an illusory part of reality rather we are reality itself illusorily conceived
8094261 there once lived a great warrior though quite old he still was able to defeat any challenger his reputation extended far and wide throughout the land and many students gathered to study under him
8094262 how could you endure such indignity how did you drive him away
8094263 if someone comes to give you a gift and you do not receive it
8094264 one time when the master was washing his bowls he saw two birds contending over a frog
8094265 to make things as easy as possible to understand we can summarize the four boundless qualities in the single phrase a kind heart just train yourself to have a kind heart always and in all situations
8094266 what is a weekend man you ask a weekend man is a person who has abandoned the present in favor of the past or the future he is really more interested in what happened to him twenty years ago or in what is going to happen to him next week than he is in what is happening to him today if the truth were known nothing much happens to most of us during the course of our daily passage it has to be said unless we are test pilots or movie stars most of us are likely to wake up tomorrow to the same ordinary flatness of our lives this is not really such a bad thing it is probably better than fighting off a sabre tooth tiger at the entrance to the cave first off we must cast about for a diversion a diversion is anything that removes us from the ordinary present sometimes we divert ourselves into our own pasts this is more likely to happen as we grow older i am only thirty for instance but in the course of an average day i sometimes shake my heads a dozen times to keep from sinking into my own past diverting oneself into the past would not be so bad if it didnt bring on the nostalgies but of course it does and a severe case of the nostalgies can often as not leave a person worse off than he was before it is also possible to divert oneself into the future that is look forward to something that is going to happen to you on friday night or next july twenty third this is alright except that it never happens the way you imagine it will in fact its just as likely to turn into disappointment and that can plunge a person into the worst kind of despair the weekend man simply never learns to live with the thundering ironies he is forever looking backwards and being afflicted by a painful sense of loss or he is looking forward and being continually disappointed what to do well youll just have to work it out for yourself i myself just drift along hoping that the daily passage will deliver up a few painless diversions most of the time however i am quietly gritting my teeth and just holding on
8094267 the general root of superstition is that men observe when things hit and not when they miss and commit to memory the one and pass over the other
8094268 standing on the bare ground my head bathed by the blithe air and uplifted into infinite space all mean egotism vanishes i become a transparent eyeball i am nothing i see all the currents of the universal being circulate through me i am part or parcel of god
8094269 why should we all use our creative power and write or paint or play music or whatever it tells us to do because there is nothing that makes people so generous joyful lively bold and compassionate so indifferent to fighting and the accumulation of objects and money because the best way to know the truth or beauty is to try to express it and what is the purpose of existence here or yonder but to discover truth and beauty and express it share it with others
8094270 if an ordinary person is silent it may be a tactical manoeuvre if a writer is silent he is lying
8094271 do we have buddha nature are we essentially holy and perfect and beyond all limitation of course we are then why are we such a mess spiritually and why must we bear the indignity of embodiment shitting pissing growing old and dying we know better but we do it on purpose zhaozho says why do we do it because its the only way we can express our gratitude for the immensity of what we are
8094272 this screen is empty of an independent self empty in this sense means that the screen is full of everything the entire cosmos the presence of this computer display screen proves the presence of the whole universe
8094273 it is less what one is that should matter than what one is not
8094274 the sky looks very blue is that its real color or is it because it is so far away and has no end
8094275 zen means doing anything perfectly making mistakes perfectly being defeated perfectly hesitating perfectly having a stomach ache perfectly doing anything perfectly or imperfectly perfectly what is the meaning of this perfectly how does it differ from perfectly perfectly is in the will perfectly is in the activity perfectly means that the activity is harmonious in all its parts and fully achieves its proposed end perfectly means that at each moment of the activity there is no egoism in it or rather that our ego works together with the attraction and repulsion of the egoism of the nature within and without us our pain is not only our own pain it is the pain of the universe the joy of the universe is also our joy our failure or misjudgment is that of nature which never hopes or despairs but keeps on trying to the end
8094276 watch the mind watch the process of experience arising and ceasing with mindfulness you can see the real owner of things do you think this is your world your body we only rent this house why not find out who really owns it
8094277 thousands of repetitions and out of ones true self perfection emerges
8094278 perfection is a deep sea of wisdom samsara is like a whirling chaos
8094279 as soon as you conceive of the buddha you are forced to conceive of sentient beings or of concepts and no concepts of vital and trivial ones which will surely imprison you between those two iron mountains
8094280 i went out on the porch nothing silence vast silence of the woods full of fireflies the stars down in the south the huge sign of the scorpion the red eye of regulus just stars not a light from any house or farm only fireflies and stars and silence a car racing by the road then more silence nothing nothing when a car goes by you can feel the alien frenzy of it someone madly going somewhere for no reason i am a complete prisoner under these stars with nothing or perhaps with everything i sit on the porch and deliberately refuse to rationalize anything to explain anything or to comment on anything only on what is there i am there fireflies stars darkness the massive shadows of the woods the vague dark valley and nothing nothing nothing is she thinking of me loving me is her heart calling to mine in the dark i dont know i cant honestly say that i know i cant honestly say i know anything except that it is late that i cant sleep that there are fireflies all over the place and that there is not the remotest possibility of making any poetic statement on this you dont write poems about nothing and yet somehow this nothing seems to be everything i look at the south sky and for some ungodly reason for which there is no reason everything is complete i think of going back to bed in peace without knowing why a peace that cannot be justified by anything by any reason any proof any argument by any supposition there are no suppositions left only fireflies i want to tell you something but i dont know how to begin to say it i am afraid that if i start talking and writing i will confuse everything nothing needs to be said
8094281 real fearlessness is the product of our tenderness it comes from letting the world tickle your raw and beautiful heart
8094282 zen is at once irresistibly attractive and unutterably repulsive zen draws us to it for many reasons first because at last we have a belief which we need not believe in no dogmas no ritual no mythology no church no priest no holy book what a relief
8094283 there towers a huge mountain here lies a boundless ocean birds are singing trees are growing and i sit here looking over the verdant meadow yet in spite of all these nay indeed by reason of these i believe in the nothingness of existence in the non reality of realities and in the absolute oneness of all things and it is thereby that i gain my peace of mind and realize the sense of perfect freedom in my everyday life
8094284 soon the childs clear eye is clouded over by ideas and opinions preconceptions and abstractions simple free being becomes encrusted with the burdensome armor of the ego not until years later does an instinct come that a vital sense of mystery has been withdrawn the sun glints through the pines and the heart is pierced in a moment of beauty and strange pain like a memory of paradise after that day we become seekers
8094285 there are in zen no sacred books of dogmatic tenets if i am asked therefore what zen teaches i would answer zen teaches nothing whatever teachings there are in zen they come out of ones mind we teach ourselves zen merely points the way
8094286 the aim of zen is to focus attention on reality itself instead of our intellectual and emotional reactions to reality reality being the ever changing ever growing indefinable something known as life which will never stop for a moment for us to fit it satisfactorily into any rigid system of pigeonholes and ideas
8094287 basically there can only be two answers one is to overcome separateness and find unity by regression to the state of unity that existed before awareness ever arose this is before man was born the other answer is to be fully born to develop ones awareness ones reason ones capacity to love to such a point that one transcends ones own egocentric involvement and arrives at a new harmony at a new oneness with the world
8094288 the thing about zen is that it pushes contradictions to their ultimate limit where one has to choose between madness and innocence and zen suggests that we may be driving toward one or the other on a cosmic scale driving toward them because one way or the other as madmen or innocents we are already there it might be good to open our eyes and see
8094289 to be uncertain is uncomfortable but to be certain is ridiculous
8094290 life happens too fast for you to ever think about it if you could just persuade people of this but they insist on amassing information
8094291 reality is flowing this does not mean that everything moves changes becomes science and common experience tell us that it means that movement change becoming is everything that there is there is nothing else everything is movement is change the time that we ordinarily think about is not real time but a picture of space
8094292 even though you think you know exactly who you are it is very difficult to have real understanding of oneself your self conception continually changes as you discover more and more about yourself if you have complete understanding then even ideas of the wisdom of enlightenment or the status of detachment will be seen for what they are tentative and delusive
8094293 the insight that everybody and everything has surfaced to the enlightened state of mind simultaneously with you is definitely accompanying the very moment of realization
8094294 satori enlightenment comes only after one has exhausted ones thinking only when one is convinced the mind cannot grasp itself
8094295 thinking is useful in many ways but there are some occasions when thinking interferes with the work and you have to leave it behind and let the unconscious come forward in such cases you cease to be your conscious master but become an instrument in the hands of the unknown the unknown has no ego consciousness and consequently no thought of winning the contest because it moves at the level of non duality where there is neither subject nor object
8094296 neither mind alone nor imagination alone is sufficient to attain full enlightenment but both are necessary without a very highly developed rational mind it is impossible to reach full enlightenment ultimately the mind is not a barrier but a path in the impure lands of dualistic thinking the mind is partly a barrier but you must not back away from mind but rather commit even more to it and develop it through its problems you cannot overcome the weaknesses of faulty thinking by eliminating thinking but only by improving thinking not all thinking is dualistic thinking the dualistic mind is a passageway
8094297 the koan makes a thought seem absurd by suggesting that the opposite proposition might be just as useful the creative breakthrough comes when you stop trying to save your old theory or mend the fan
8094298 one of the most curious characteristics of human beings particularly westerners is that pain and inconvenience stimulate their vitality far more than pleasure in a very precise sense of the word human beings are spoilt a spoilt child is one who has come to expect certain privileges and accepts them as rights he is not grateful for these privileges in fact they bore him the only time he feels strongly about them is when they are curtailed then he sulks all human beings take their happiness for granted and only question life when they are in pain
8094299 its beautiful here by this pond i wish somebody loved me
8094300 i wonder if there are any catfish in this pond it seems like a perfect place for them
8094301 nobody today is normal everybody is a little bit crazy or unbalanced peoples minds are running all the time their perceptions of the world are partial incomplete they are eaten alive by their egos they think they see but they are mistaken all they do is project their madness their world upon the world there is no clarity no wisdom in that
8094302 there is a silent self within us whose presence is disturbing precisely because it is so silent it cant be spoken it has to remain silent to articulate it to verbalize it is to tamper with it and in some ways to destroy it
8094303 ones whole being must be an act for which there can be found no word this is the primary meaning of faith on this basis other dimensions of belief can be made credible otherwise not my whole being must be a yes and an amen and an exclamation that is not heard only after that is there any point in exclamations and even after that there is no point in exclamations ones acts must be part of the same silent exclamation if only we could realize that nothing has to be uttered utterance makes sense only when it is spontaneous and free
8094304 actually one decides ones life by responding to a word that is
8094305 we are all too ready to believe that the self that we have created out of our more or less inauthentic efforts to be real in the eyes of others is a
8094306 the world consists of imaginary people claiming imaginary virtues and suffering from imaginary happiness
8094307 at the center of our being is a point of nothingness which is untouched by sin and by illusion a point of pure truth a point or spark which belongs entirely to god which is never at our disposal from which god disposes of our lives which is inaccessible to the fantasies of our own mind or the brutalities of our own will this little point of nothingness and of absolute poverty is the pure glory of god in us it is so to speak his name written in us as our poverty as our indigence as our dependence as our sonship it is like a pure diamond blazing with the invisible light of heaven it is in everybody and if we could see it we would see these billions of points of light coming together in the face and blaze of a sun that would make all the darkness and cruelty of life vanish completely i have no program for this seeing it is only given but the gate of heaven is everywhere
8094308 i have my own way to walk and for some reason or other zen is right in the middle of it wherever i go
8094309 do you imagine the universe is agitated go into the desert at night and look out at the stars this practice should answer the question
8094310 do not i beg you look for anything behind phenomena they are themselves their own lesson
8094311 it is easy to suppose that few people realize on that occasion which comes to all of us when we look at the blue sky for the first time that is to say not merely see it but look at it and experience it and for the first time have a sense that we live in the center of a physical poetry a geography that would be intolerable except for the non geography that exists there few people realize that they are looking at the world of their own thoughts and the world of their own feelings
8094312 you have to experience duality for a long time until you see its not there
8094313 in a certain sense zen is feeling life instead of feeling something about life
8094314 that each day i may walk unceasingly on the banks of water that my soul may repose on the branches of trees which i planted that i may refresh myself under the shadow of a sycamore
8094315 happiness is a how not a what a talent not an object
8094316 each one of you is perfect the way you are and you can use a little improvement
8094317 if were willing to give up hope that insecurity and pain can be exterminated then we can have the courage to relax with the groundlessness of our situation this is the first step on the path
8094318 we cannot begin perfectly there is confusion messiness untidiness and constant dichotomy constant reference point but at least we are moving in the direction of unconditional being we are gazing at the star of bethlehem on the horizon it is far far away but still there is hope a spark of luminosity is there the land may be dark the sky may be gray and black it might be chilly and we might be cold uncomfortable tired and restless but nevertheless the star of bethlehem is over there human beings hope the final hope that human beings could ever be hopeful of is enlightenment the star of bethlehem on the horizon
8094319 jacques lusseyrans who became blind at the age of seven but found all of his senses even vision opening in an extraordinary way instead of closing down said
8094320 the memory doesnt bring our friends back so much as it allows us to see them perhaps to see them with a sudden and revealed clarity perhaps to see them as frankly we never saw them when they were with us and if we see what we see is not a thing of memory not the past but rather the present and if we see this is also not a matter of memory it stands before us in a sudden and revealed clarity stands before us as our friends work and as itself it is an unexpected gift an unexpected clear gift
8094321 the imagination is so vivid as to be almost an extension of consciousness
8094322 the sensation of writing a book is the sensation of spinning blinded by love and daring it is the sensation of a stunt pilots turning barrel rolls or an inchworms blind rearing from a stem in search of a route at its worst it feels like alligator wrestling at the level of the sentence at its best the sensation of writing is that of any unmerited grace it is handed to you but only if you look for it you search you break your fists your back your brain and then and only then it is handed to you from the corner of your eye you see motion something is moving through the air and headed your way it is a parcel bound in ribbons and bows it has two white wings it flies directly at you you can read your name on it if it were a baseball you would hit it out of the park it is that one pitch in a thousand you see in slow motion its wings beat slowly as a hawks
8094323 one of the few things i know about writing is this spend it all shoot it play it lose it all right away every time do not hoard what seems good for a later place in the book or for another book give it give it all give it now the impulse to save something good for a better place later is the signal to spend it now something more will arise for later something better these things fill from behind from beneath like well water similarly the impulse to keep to yourself what you have learned is not only shameful it is destructive anything you do not give freely and abundantly becomes lost to you you open your safe and find ashes
8094324 why do you never find anything written about that idiosyncratic thought you advert to about your fascination with something no one else understands because it is up to you there is something you find interesting for a reason hard to explain it is hard to explain because you have never read it on any page there you begin you were made and set here to give voice to this your own astonishment
8094325 it makes more sense to write one big book a novel or nonfiction narrative than to write many stories or essays into a long ambitious project you can fit or pour all you possess and learn a project that takes five years will accumulate those years inventions and richnesses much of those years reading will feed the work further writing sentences is difficult whatever their subject it is no less difficult to write sentences in a recipe than sentences in moby dick so you might as well write moby dick similarly since every original work requires a unique form it is more prudent to struggle with the outcome of only one form that of a long work than to struggle with the many forms of a collection every book has an intrinsic impossibility which its writer discovers as soon as his first excitement dwindles the problem is structural it is insoluble it is why no one can ever write this book complex stories essays and poems have this problem too the prohibitive structural defect the writer wishes he had never noticed he writes it in spite of that he finds ways to minimize the difficulty he strengthens other virtues he cantilevers the whole narrative out into thin air and it holds why are we reading if not in hope of beauty laid bare life heightened and its deepest mystery probed can the writer isolate and vivify all in experience that most deeply engages our intellects and our hearts can the writer renew our hopes for literary forms why are we reading if not in hope that the writer will magnify and dramatize our days will illuminate and inspire us with wisdom courage and the hope of meaningfulness and press upon our minds the deepest mysteries so we may feel again their majesty and power what do we ever know that is higher than that power which from time to time seizes our lives and which reveals us startlingly to ourselves as creatures set down here bewildered why does death so catch us by surprise and why love we still and always want waking
8094326 those of us who have been true readers all our life seldom fully realize the enormous extension of our being which we owe to authors we realize it best when we talk with an unliterary friend he may be full of goodness and good sense but he inhabits a tiny world in it we should be suffocated the man who is contented to be only himself and therefore less a self is in prison my own eyes are not enough for me i will see through those of others reality even seen through the eyes of many is not enough i will see what others have invented reading great literature i become a thousand men and yet remain myself like the night sky in the greek poem i see with a myriad eyes but it is still i who see here as in worship in love in moral action and in knowing i transcend myself and am never more myself than when i do
8094327 a novel is a big dream a whale of a dream
8094328 putting things together in writing is like building altars on paper
8094329 when we read a story we inhabit it the covers of the book are like a roof and four walls what is to happen next will take place within the four walls of the story and this is possible because the storys voice makes everything its own
8094330 works do not have a meaning rather they have different possible readings and the possibility of reading lies in the fact that at the heart of the work there lies an absence the center of the work is a void this is what fascinates the fault of impatience is the desire for the work to mean something in kafkas case as he sometimes writes in his diaries this was the desire for the work to be a means of salvation the other side of his experience however was the failure of writing the numerous stories begun and then abruptly aborted writing as a terrifying experience of the impossibility of writing this as the truth of writing rather than as a sanctuary for someone expelled from the ordinary world of work and love the everyday world is made up of meanings which are present to the individual and therefore determined by a horizon of truth it is this world which disappears in the work the world of the work is quite different from the world of work in the everyday world all is there to be grasped and acted upon in the world of the work everything appears ambiguous and the horizon of this ambiguity is the absence of meaning altogether the idea of a book only appears in its own impossibility every individual author experiences this as the failure of the work to reach perfection the writer unlike the philosopher is not a mouthpiece for an anonymous truth rather writing is the very experience of the impossibility of truth
8094331 if i lose the light of the sun i will write by candlelight moonlight no light if i lose paper and ink i will write in blood on forgotten walls i will write always i will capture nights all over the world and bring them to you
8094332 i believe that what we want to write wants to be written i believe that as i have an impulse to create the something i want to create has an impulse to want to be born my job then is to show up on the page and let that something move through me in a sense what wants to be written is none of my business
8094333 there is such a thing as unconditional expression that does not come from self or other it manifests out of nowhere like mushrooms in a meadow like hailstones like thundershowers
8094334 didnt anyone ever tell you it was all right to write
8094335 ordinary life does not interest me i seek only the high moments
8094336 your kindness makes it hard for me to respond with equal grace
8094337 writing is a witness a seismograph of sentiment as well as of meaning
8094338 creativity is allowing oneself to make mistakes art is knowing which ones to keep
8094339 the trouble with words is that you never know whose mouths theyve been in
8094340 the first demand any work of any art makes upon us is surrender
8094341 which is why i am writing this book to think to understand it just happens to be the way im made i have to write things down to feel i fully comprehend them
8094342 imagination grows by exercise and contrary to common belief is more powerful in the mature than in the young
8094343 the writer of prose can only step aside when the poet passes
8094344 dont listen to any advice thats what id say write only what you want to write please yourself you are the genius theyre not especially dont listen to people such as publishers who think that you need to write what readers say they want readers dont always know what they want i dont know what i want to read until i go into a bookshop and look around at the books other people have written and the books i enjoy reading most are books i would never in a million years have thought of myself so the only thing you need to do is forget about pleasing other people and aim to please yourself alone that way youll have a chance of writing something that other people will want to read because itll take them by surprise
8094345 dont compare yourself to anyone and learn to keep from building expectations people develop at different rates with different results and luck is also involved your only worry for yourself should be did i work today be happy for the successes of your friends because good fortune for one of us is good fortune for all of us you will never write anything worth keeping if you allow yourself to give in to petty worries over whether you are treated as you think you deserve or your rewards are commensurate to the work youve done that will almost never be the case and the artist who expects great rewards and complete understanding is a fool
8094346 trust your original impulse trust the muse completely until she proves to be beyond the shadow of a doubt unfaithful but after vision comes revision thats another thing a bag of tricks and then some you need to know confidently that during revision you can fix anything change anything to suit yourself all of us would rather not have to revise anything at all just put it through the typewriter or into the computer perfect and complete the first time effortlessly pure inspiration no sweat and strain and doubt and that happens probably will happen once or twice in your lifetime and that will always seem to be the best time the way it ought to be but through the labor sometimes hard labor you will discover what every good writer does that you can make a work seem to be the effortless result of pure inspiration
8094347 the use of automatic writing or scribbling to tap the subconscious was borrowed by the surrealists from spiritualist mediums particularly helene smith muse of automatic writing the objective of automatism is to capture original thoughts uncontaminated by reason or aesthetics through accelerated intensified doodling in which unexpected and unpredictable images can appear it works like this put yourself in a receptive frame of mind a bottle of scotch helps and draw or write something without consciously thinking thats much more difficult than it seems the hope is that the resulting scrawl or wordage produces an unpredictable image to develop into something new and original
8094348 the truth of the thing is not the think of it but the feel of it
8094349 most people have with the help of conventions turned their solutions toward what is easy and toward the easiest side of the easy but it is clear that we must trust in what is difficult everything alive trusts in it everything in nature grows and defends itself any way it can and is spontaneously itself tries to be itself at all costs and against all opposition we know little but that we must trust in what is difficult is a certainty that will never abandon us it is good to be solitary for solitude is difficult that something is difficult must be one more reason for us to do it
8094350 being deeply loved by someone gives you strength loving someone deeply gives you courage
8094351 the four walls are a blanket i wrap around in in timelessness and nowhere to go to sleep
8094352 the artists world is limitless it can be found anywhere far from where he lives or a few feet away it is always on his doorstep
8094353 that we find a crystal or a poppy beautiful means that we are less alone that we are more deeply inserted into existence than the course of a single life would lead us to believe
8094354 if we consider the unblushing promises of reward and the staggering nature of the rewards promised in the gospels it would seem that our lord finds our desires not too strong but too weak we are half hearted creatures fooling around with drink and sex and ambition when infinite joy is offered us like an ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies in a slum because he cannot imagine what is meant by the offer of a holiday at the sea we are far too easily pleased
8094355 not only is there no guarantee of the temporal immortality of the human soul that is to say of its eternal survival after death but in any case this assumption completely fails to accomplish the purpose for which it has always been intended or is some riddle solved by my surviving for ever is not this eternal life itself as much of a riddle as our present life the solution of the riddle of life in space and time lies outside space and time
8094356 joshu was the great teacher of tang dynasty china and what he said was so wonderful that light was said to sparkle from his mouth when he spoke he lived on a mountain that had a stone bridge known all over china for its beauty
8094357 i came to see the stone bridge of joshu but all i see here is a wooden bridge
8094358 you only see a wooden bridge well it lets horses cross it lets asses cross come on over
8094359 nothing we look at is ever seen without some shift and flicker that constant flaking of vision which we take as imperfections of the eye or simply the instability of attention itself and we ignore this illusory screen for the solid reality behind it but the solid reality is the illusion the shift and flicker is all there is
8094360 i hope you will live longer than i you must promise me that you will not be satisfied with minor achievements in whatever you do
8094361 the zen master sosan and his student samyong were taking a walk through the mountains and sosan was slightly ahead
8094362 the foolish reject what they see not what they think the wise reject what they think not what they see
8094363 nothing influences our ability to cope with the difficulties of existence so much as the context in which we view them the more contexts we can choose between the less do the difficulties appear to be inevitable and insurmountable the more complexities the more crevices there are through which we can crawl
8094364 the moment you place your happiness in the fulfillment of any want or wish that is outside yourself outside the way in anything but the thing as it is as it is becoming at that moment your balance is lost and you fall straight from heaven to hell
8094365 so much in writing depends on the superficiality of ones days one may be preoccupied with shopping and income tax returns and chance conversations but the stream of the unconsciousness continues to flow undisturbed solving problems planning ahead one sits down sterile and dispirited at the desk and suddenly the words come as though from the air the situations that seemed blocked in a hopeless impasse move forward the work has been done while one slept or shopped or talked with friends
8094366 harry i will save you let go harry i will save you let go
8094367 this grand show is eternal it is always sunrise somewhere the dew is never all dried at once a shower is forever falling vapor ever rising eternal sunrise eternal sunset eternal dawn and gloaming on seas and continents and islands each in its turn as the round earth rolls
8094368 judging from picture books apparently heaven is a partly cloudy place
8094369 having been invited to a tea ceremony i entered a room in a nearby temple where i noticed a hanging scroll in the alcove
8094370 if you use your mind to study reality you wont understand either your mind or reality if you study reality without using your mind youll understand both
8094371 does the self really exist there are wide variations of the theory there are people who believe they make the sun rise or control the weather some schizophrenics appropriate a fantastic range of sensory input to the self believing themselves the focus and the orchestrator of great cosmic events other mental patients and some mystics completely lose the sense of self facing a bewildering confusion of sensation with no unifying scheme to make sense of it most peoples experience of course lies between these extremes but normality does not establish truth the fact that most people have a normal self the subject of consistent and limited experience does not make the self real from the perspective of every spiritual tradition entered deeply enough the existence of ego is considered an illusion the normal psychosis
8094372 we each have a self an image developed over time
8094373 you sit here for days saying this is strange business youre the strange business you have the energy of the sun in you but you keep knotting it up at the base of your spine youre some weird kind of gold that wants to stay melted in the furnace so you wont have to become coins
8094374 we that indivisible divinity that operates in us have dreamed the world we have dreamed it as enduring mysterious visible omnipresent in space and stable in time but we have consented to tenuous and eternal intervals of illogicalness in its architecture that we might know it is false
8094375 love is the connection with spirit and one way it flows is through form thats the state of rapture rumi praises the joy of being inside an intersection with the divine which is what this world is
8094376 people who study the path clearly know there is such a thing why do they fail to get the message and go on doubting it is because their faith is not complete enough and their doubt is not deep enough only with depth and completeness be it faith or doubt is it really zen if you are incapable of introspection like this you will eventually get lost in confusion and lose the thread wearing out and stumbling halfway along the road but if you can look into yourself there is no one else
8094377 the trouble with westerners is that they want to witness their own enlightenment
8094378 stop doing stuff all the time and watch what happens
8094379 we are hidden in ourselves like a truth hidden in isolated facts when we know that this one in us is one in all then our truth is revealed
8094380 tenzo we are vegetarians so we dont kill animals but we eat carrots and potatoes what do you think about killing vegetables
8094381 well i definitely think we should kill them before we eat them
8094382 the greatest thing is to give thanks for everything he who has learned this knows what it means to live he has penetrated the whole mystery of life giving thanks for everything
8094383 only the idea of self remains floating on a sea of cells only heartbeats short of eternity in breath after breath we dwell
8094384 there is nothing there is no god and no universe there is only empty space and in it a lost and homeless and wandering and companionless and indestructible thought and i am that thought and god and the universe and time and life and death and joy and sorrow and pain only a grotesque and brutal dream evolved from the frantic imagination of that same thought
8094385 if you would be a real seeker after truth it is necessary that at least once in your life you doubt as far as possible all things
8094386 because the soul is progressive it never quite repeats itself but in every act attempts the production of a new and fairer whole
8094387 thinking is more interesting than knowing but less interesting than looking
8094388 try again and again to complete what you are doing
8094389 throw false spirituality away like a pair of old shoes
8094390 all behavior consists of opposites learn to see backward inside out and upside down
8094391 in may i gave a day long benefit writing workshop for the zen center in santa fe i asked robert a zen priest there to teach the meditation part and also to give a zen lecture in his lecture he said that zen poems are marked by a feeling of space and also a tinge of sadness i agreed sadness comes from the knowledge of impermanence everything will eventually pass away why be sad because we love and no matter how dispassionate we become we are not ice bricks we are human beings with feelings robert said that after he read his first zen book many years ago he was young maybe seventeen the book was the zen teaching of huang po by john blofeld he wanted to become intimate with everything he bowed to trees and books and rows of lettuce in grocery stores he said his friends thought he was crazy i thought he was wonderful that is what zen is about to have an intimate connection with the world and on top of it to know about its passing of course there is sadness but how sweet and at the heart of it what bravery we know about impermanence but it does not drive us into a hole we dare in the face of it to stand up and become intimate and not just with human beings which is hard enough but also with the sky water chairs cows and sidewalks is this not the way of the writer the sad thing is that the knowledge of impermanence is often not enough for human beings we have to hit ourselves over the head
8094392 from a cultures point of view it is far better if your everyday mind the habitual automatized way you think and feel is shaped to reflect the cultures consensus beliefs and values then you will automatically experience the right perceptions and interpretations and so it will be natural to act in the culturally appropriate way even when there are no agents of social coercion around
8094393 a physicist visits a colleague and notices a horseshoe hanging on the wall above the entrance
8094394 but ive been told that it works even if you dont believe in it
8094395 the essence of meditation is training in mindfulness this is done by resting the attention on an external meditation support and returning to it every time it drifts away into thought this action is possible because one part of the mind observes and identifies with thoughts and feelings as they arise if we did not have this capacity for self reflective awareness we would not know or realize we were thinking when thinking happens
8094396 if you have been born a man thinking is necessary but it will be most exalted in your life to think about your thoughts and correct them
8094397 what is the mirror of being non being always bring a mirror of non existence as a gift any other gift is foolish

8094402 video games were not invented yet and no union to obtain rights from existed
8094403 information from the web can already travel at the speed of light across optic fibers but because outdated electronics process this data its all for naught the australian scientists took advantage of speedy optic fibers by creating a thumbnail sized photonic integrated circuit which can rapidly process data to the point that it can change the path of information one million times in a second at an initial demonstration the scientists showed that the chip generates an internet 60 times faster than it is today
8094404 even the most abstract mind is affected by the surroundings of the body no one is immune to the impressions that impinge on the senses from outside
8094405 creation is what we do while were waiting to die if were not we sit around watching reruns eating potato chips and drinking diet coke and we fall asleep we dont even know when finally out of boredom and frustration we die and even though we will die just the same we can choose to stay awake to create when we create we live
8094406 remember the universe has a lot of things going on that we dont know about we have no idea what the universe is like what it wants to have happen we dont know whats trying to come through us say yes to what is trying to come through you and shazam youre answering a score of seemingly unrelated problems that seem to be about this piece of writing but you find out years later are answers to other pieces of writing or to issues in your life or to problems you were going to have in the future but now wont
8094407 in the flowing river there are so many things fishes leaves dead animals but it is always moving and your mind is like that it is everlastingly restless flitting from one thing to another like a butterfly
8094408 i think compassion and imagination go together if you give up trying to use your imagination for new things and for expanding yourself you begin to wither away and if you begin to draw back from your compassion you begin to wither away too compassion and imagination not intelligence are what make the human species valuable and thats our gift thats our great talent and if we dont live up to it it will kill us if you dont live up to your talent it kills you
8094409 sometimes one sees the world in a way one is not aware of at other times were never really seeing the world were only seeing a moments take on the world this is true of images images are a way of seeing the world which you didnt notice before and something you cannot make by an act of will its something that is suddenly revealed to you the world has layers and you start seeing that these layers happen all at once theyre all together i think thats what is startling about images at the moment of seeing they seem so obvious why didnt i see that before mandelstam wrote wonderfully about images he said that an image is not an act of will a real image is something that occurs to you he said an image is like running across a river on a bridge of boats and when you get to the other side you look back and see that all the boats have moved or drifted and are in different places and you realize it would be impossible to do all over again thats always seemed like a great image right there
8094410 writing itself can be meditative we dont meditate to become good meditators we meditate to get in touch with ourselves to be at peace with the greater universe to be fully in the moment we meditate to relax and to soften the edges of the world writing meditation is not meant to create great writing although it may help us to do so it allows us to be in the moment the flow of ink on paper the movement of mind and pen and our ability to lose ourselves in the very act of writing combine in a powerful creative way of meditation
8094411 if we are honest many of us consider ourselves to be rather lazy still haunted by those school reports that said
8094412 the places where you consistently get it wrong are where you have the greatest subconscious resistance each mistake is a gift that point is a pressure point a place where the entire piece can reveal itself and crack open
8094413 research has shown that in the first few milliseconds of our perceiving something we do not only unconsciously comprehend what it is but decide whether we like it or not the cognitive unconscious presents our awareness with not just the identity of what we see but an opinion about it our emotions have a mind of their own one which can hold views quite independently of our rational mind
8094414 the fault arises from your sense of personal expectations of course you could easily say that you do not have any expectations but the desire not to have expectations only becomes another form of expectation so expectations are a stumbling block we color and re edit our experiences drastically how do we do that we do it with our passion aggression and ignorance passion colors our expectations with desire we are constantly trying to mold our expectations in terms of what we want the rest of what we hear is completely inaudible the rest of what we see is completely invisible we only take in what we want to see and hear whatever we see or hear is constantly subject to our rejection or our ignorance we push it away because it is personally inapplicable or we ignore it we create a mental block to shut it off because it does not suit our requirements when you are in a passionate state you begin to like the world and you begin to be attracted to certain things which is good obviously such attraction also entails possessiveness and some sense of territoriality which comes later but straightforward pure passion without ice without water without soda is good it is drinkable it is also food you can live on it its quite marvelous that we have passion that we are not made purely out of aggression its some kind of saving grace that we possess which is fantastic
8094415 there was also another reason why it was now possible to paint
8094416 through loyalty to the past our mind refuses to realize that tomorrows joy is possible only if todays makes way for it that each wave owes the beauty of its line only to the withdrawal of the preceding one
8094417 a chinese painter was once commissioned to paint the emperors favorite goat the artist asked for the goat that he might study it after two years the emperor growing impatient asked for the return of the goat the artist obliged then the emperor asked about the painting the artist confessed that he had not yet made one and taking an ink brush he drew eight nonchalant strokes creating the most perfect goat in the annals of chinese painting the zen artist tries to suggest by the simplest possible means the inherent nature of the aesthetic object anything may be painted or expressed in poetry and any sounds may become music the job of the artist is to suggest the essence the eternal qualities of the object which is in itself a work of natural art before the artist arrives on the scene in order to achieve this the artist must fully understand the inner nature of the aesthetic object its buddha nature this is the hard part technique though important is useless without it and the actual execution of the art work may be startlingly spontaneous once the artist has comprehended the essence of his subject
8094418 the new work of art does not consist of making a living or producing an object dart or in self therapy but in finding a new soul the new era is the era of spiritual creativity and soul making
8094419 surely all art is the result of ones having been in danger of having gone through an experience all the way to the end where no one can go any further the further one goes the more private the more personal the more singular an experience becomes and the thing one is making is finally the necessary irrepressible and as nearly as possible definitive utterance of this singularity
8094420 the artist because perception brings with it the imperative longing for expression tries to give us a hint of his ecstasy his glimpse of truth only those who have tried know how small a fraction of his vision he can under the most favorable circumstances contrive to represent
8094421 whenever we put pen to paper each idea will have its subsequent effect upon us certainly as we learn who we are by noting our response to what we have written but also upon the people and things around us inasmuch as it shifts to some degree the way in which we respond to them in this sense a piece of writing is always the beginning of a new journey one that not only maps our current experience but also helps us determine the state of mind we are about to move into
8094422 mans imagination always bigger than his environment overleaps the barriers of time and space and claims all worlds as eminent domain so that literature which he has the power to create as he cannot create his material surroundings possesses a dramatic intensity an epic sweep unknown in actuality in the last analysis man is as great as his daydreams or his nightmares
8094423 i have always noticed a prevalent want of courage even among persons of superior intelligence and culture as to imparting their own psychological experiences when those have been of a strange sort almost all men are afraid that what they could relate in such wise would find no parallel or response in a listeners internal life and might be suspected or laughed at a truthful traveler who should have seen some extraordinary creature in the likeness of a sea serpent would have no fear of mentioning it but the same traveler having had some singular presentiment impulse vagary of thought vision so called dream or other remarkable mental impression would hesitate considerably before he would own to it to this reticence i attribute much of the obscurity in which such subjects are involved we do not habitually communicate our experiences of these subjective things as we do our experiences of objective creation the consequence is that the general stock of experience in this regard appears exceptional and really is so in respect of being miserably imperfect
8094424 since we must understand whether ghosts and spirits exist or not how can we find out
8094425 many in the world have heard and seen something of ghosts and spirits since they vary in testimony who are to be accepted as really having heard and seen them
8094426 realize that the surface personality has no interest in anything which might disturb its darling delusions
8094427 id like to be a gecko not permanently but for ten minutes or so geckos are charming small lizardy creatures with suction pads for feet they live vertically walls are their terra firma for them trees grow sideways hills are sky pavements are walls
8094428 you have not grown old and it is not too late to dive into your increasing depths where life calmly gives out its own secret
8094429 for it is each ones responsibility to go deeper than ever before to hear that undertone for himself or herself and so move easily beyond the flat world of the map of memory into the freshness of the living present
8094430 nirvana is the coolness of letting go the inherent delight of experience when there is no grasping or resistance to life
8094431 anyone can see that if grasping and aversion were with us all day and night without ceasing who could ever stand them under that condition living things would either die or become insane instead we survive because there are natural periods of coolness of wholeness and ease in fact they last longer than the fires of our grasping and fear it is this that sustains us we have periods of rest making us refreshed alive well why dont we feel thankful for this everyday nirvana
8094432 although it is true that in acting without self interest ones interest will be fulfilled individuals who put self interest last discover that their desires are transformed as their awareness expands they develop priorities that are aligned intelligently with both the current situation and with larger influences in the world for this reason as their aims are fulfilled their environment evolves
8094433 in the latter day even sentient beings who seek out a good teacher encounter those who hold false views and they are thus never able to attain right enlightenment this is a known pedigree for heresy it is the fault of the false teachers it is not the fault of the sentient beings who come to them for help
8094434 i have just come from korea where i studied zen with kayama taigi roshi of myoshinji betsuin
8094435 in this mortal frame of mine which is made of a hundred bones and nine orifices there is something and this something is called a wind swept spirit for lack of a better name for it is much like a thin drapery that is torn and swept away at the slightest stir of the wind
8094436 it rains during the morning no visitors today i feel lonely and amuse myself by writing at random these are the words
8094437 why do we persistently forget to come alive to the world as it is in front of our faces why do we have to go to all the trouble of making art so that we can return to where we are and have been all along i think it is because of the way thought works in us to be present in the midst of our being what we are is a pure sensation that we can never exactly apprehend it is fleeting and ungraspable thought is always coming a second afterward telling us something singing a song of the past thought includes the aroma of our being alive but it also includes so much that is made so much of doing and piling up that it tempts us necessarily away from ourselves to find within our thought and perception for perception is already thought a settled free and unmade place takes effort and this is the effort of art
8094438 the stream of thinking has enormous momentum that can easily drag you along with it every thought pretends that it matters so much it wants to draw your attention in completely
8094439 what is the highest truth of the holy buddhist doctrine
8094440 the peak experience the final act as soon as you try to pursue it in thought there are white clouds for a thousand miles dont stick to the ruts in the road of the ancients you must travel a living road of your own east west foot up foot down using it directly only then will you know the peak experience that illumines the heavens and covers the earth illumines the past and flashes through the present this is your own place to settle and live when i say this i am only using water to offer flowers never adding anything extra think of this
8094441 there are enough zen centers we need more zen corners
8094442 one of the things that is realized when you see the nature of the self is that what you do and what happens to you are the same thing
8094443 life is constantly giving us our cues when the bell sounds the monks put on their robes and go to the meditation hall when anger arises the bell sounds and we take refuge in calmness of mind when confusion arises the bell sounds and we take refuge in equanimity when greed arises the bell sounds and we take refuge in the coolness of appreciating what we already have in this way everything in our life is helping and supporting our practice
8094444 there is nothing you can see that is not a flower there is nothing you can think that is not the moon
8094445 the autumn moon is incomparably beautiful any man who supposes the moon is always the same regardless of the season and is therefore unable to detect the difference in autumn must be exceedingly insensitive
8094446 as soon as i hear a name i feel convinced i can guess what the owner looks like but it never happens when i actually meet the man that his face is as i had supposed i wonder if everybody shares my experience of feeling when i hear some story about the past that the house mentioned in the story must have been rather like this or that house belonging to people of today or that the persons of the story resemble people i see now it has happened on various occasions too that i have felt just after someone has said something or i have seen something or thought of something that it has occurred before i cannot remember when it was but i feel absolutely certain that the thing has happened am i the only one who has such impressions
8094447 look at every path closely and deliberately try it as many times as you think necessary then ask yourself and yourself alone one question does this path have a heart if it does the path is good if it doesnt it is of no use both paths lead nowhere but one has a heart the other doesnt one makes for a joyful journey as long as you follow it you are one with it the other will make you curse your life one makes you strong the other weakens you
8094448 well whatever make yourself comfortable youre here forever if that frightens you consider youve always been here
8094449 most people think life sucks and then you die not me i beg to differ i think life sucks then you get cancer then your dog dies your wife leaves you the cancer goes into remission you get a new dog you get remarried you owe ten million dollars in medical bills but you work hard for thirty five years and you pay it back and then one day you have a massive stroke your whole right side is paralyzed you have to limp along the streets and speak out of the left side of your mouth and drool but you go into rehabilitation and regain the power to walk and the power to talk and then one day you step off a curb at sixty seventh street and bang you get hit by a city bus and then you die maybe
8094450 its just a lot of superstition in all my years ive never seen a ghost not one
8094451 my chums and i were in the process of recounting horrific tales of ghosts and apparitions if you wish to remain in our company you must endure this
8094452 whose name i cannot recall he regularly encountered the ghostly figure of an old man in a pale colored nightgown who was prone to walking up and down the stairs of the chaps home and with his head held under his arm
8094453 this chap could stand it no longer and subsequently decided to take his own life by shooting himself in the head with a pistol now it is rumoured that he himself haunts that house
8094454 but allow me to relate the story of the man whose wife gave birth to an apparition
8094455 this apparition grew to a fine old age until he reached a maturity he could not improve on and now he haunts the church in which his parents had married
8094456 a soldier in the great war was lurking in the trenches with bullets whizzing around his ears when suddenly he noticed beside him his own ghost it was identical in every detail and he was naturally astonished seconds later this poor chap was struck in the head by an enemy shot and was killed instantly but strangely he recalls then holding his own dying figure in his arms for he had taken over the form of the apparition that was beside him
8094457 i have never heard of the chap who saw the ghost on the stairs how do you know this if he shot himself the same with the soldier in the war he was dead just seconds after supposedly seeing his own ghost so how do you know this and as for the fellow whose wife gave birth to a phantom that is pure drivel of the finest water
8094458 and do not return you are far from worthy of our company
8094459 since frank wren and i both know how much people generally dont enjoy undergoing season ending surgery to begin with but we figured better safe than sorry
8094460 we dont want to see one player on the dl next year after this
8094461 season ending surgery must be a tough thing to going through
8094462 and it was so very kind of dr andrews to coming all the way out here to making us feel better about the whole process i feeling so much better about next year already i hitting ball gooder then
8094463 we feel this is the best direction to take the team
8094464 we talked it over and it was tough but it was just a matter of investing in our team and showing our guys how much we care about their health we told the guys the season ending surgeries were an early christmas present

8094492 one consideration is that there arent enough young people playing outside
8094493 but kids need variety and they benefit from as many activities and as much exercise as possible
8094494 most parents would much rather their young person was in a facility doing structured exercise than standing on a corner drinking cider
8094495 resistance work in a gym can be done safely by children as long as the coach is very well trained
8094496 the experience has to be fun otherwise children wont make it a part of their lives
8094497 the visual media is obsessed with celebrities and is sending out messages about their physical appearance which say you can always look better it breeds insecurity
8094498 research from the 1960s shows a large amount of concern about weight in teenage girls but the pressures have got greater particularly with the current publicity about obesity what seems to have happened is that girls are feeling that pressure from a younger age nine or even earlier
8094499 weight is normally fairly high on the list of their problems but it can be anything the size of their thighs or a fat tummy the size of their feet or just having freckles
8094500 a lot of parents arent very successful about concealing their own insecurities about their body image but they need to really theres very little magic to suggest to help girls improve their body image they can be terribly secretive about whats happening to them girls particularly tend to internalise their problems
8094501 its really important that parents set a family agenda for eating and appearance decisions youre taking about your own body wont go un noticed by your kids although it doesnt necessarily mean theyll follow them
8094502 reassurance is important too and remember that this is a phase they do come out of it its part of growing up
8094503 the key thing is to start to get to know people in your area before you go on maternity leave
8094504 the first few weeks in particular can be very lonely indeed
8094505 but becoming a parent can be an experience that makes you feel happier than youve ever felt
8094506 theres an enormous amount of fulfilment but its really important to have someone to share that with and other mums will understand you
8094507 and many of the mums who feel isolated feel like that because they think theyre not good enough mothers they dont like to be around other mums because they think those mothers are better than them so they cut themselves off
8094508 the way out of that is to try to reach out to other mums that are like you and that you can have a laugh with find your mum soulmate
8094509 the transition into motherhood is so difficult it takes us out of the comfort zones about who we are who our friends are and so on all these things are redesigned after you have a baby
8094510 these are all costs that are almost as unexpected as the babys arrival often was but they can have long term consequences for the families involved
8094511 such childcare is a cost thats often not been considered but if parents cant rely on family and friends to help out its hard to avoid
8094512 i havent even been able to go back part time
8094513 indie was totally unexpected when he came as were the costs
8094514 when indie was born sienna didnt really understand where id gone my husband had a hard job trying to juggle the family life but sienna adapted well
8094515 it was very difficult emotionally and financially but you get through it you just have to
8094516 vaccine programmes are not the magic bullet cure that they are claimed to be and bombarding children with a cocktail of vaccines could be causing some serious health problems with hundreds if not thousands of children adversely affected every year
8094517 there remains uncertainty whether the growing number of childhood vaccinations is contributing to the rising numbers of children affected by asthma diabetes and other immune related disorders
8094518 one vaccine expert disclosed to me that we will probably never be able to test the safety of vaccines while we bundle so many of them together and administer them at the same time this means its almost impossible to distinguish the side effects of one from another
8094519 until then i had no particular opinion on vaccines and routinely gave them to my patients children and my own and felt secure in the knowledge that they were safe
8094520 yet when i researched and tried to get the governments side of the story on mmr instead of being reassured which i expected i was dismayed to find that evidence showing it was safe was simply not there it had been introduced with virtually no safety controls at all
8094521 i have been told that there is no one study that can disprove that mmr may cause 10 of autism cases in this country in susceptible children studies can show that mmr does not cause all autism thats not good enough and when i found that out i offered patients measles mumps and rubella vaccines singly
8094522 ive heard stories of parents trying to decide whether to vaccinate their children being patronised and bullied and even told it was the equivalent of abusing their child if they didnt opt for a vaccine
8094523 i am not anti vaccination they have an important role in the protection of children i am in favour of some while with others i believe they are not as effective as they are made out to be all im calling for is the right for parents to have a truthful and open discussion on this issue
8094524 before making any final decisions you are advised to consult a health professional about the specific needs of your child
8094525 mmr is the first and only vaccine to contain three live viruses the studies to look for potential problems that this previously untried combination might cause have never been done
8094526 measles vaccine can cause permanent brain damage and sspe the rare but fatal brain disease though almost certainly less commonly than naturally caught measles
8094527 its highly toxic is known to cause brain damage and has been implicated in behavioural problems in children
8094528 spread out the length of time between the pediacel 5 in 1 meningitis c and pneumococcal vaccines all of which contain aluminium so the amount of aluminium your baby receives on any one day will be reduced
8094529 we all need to use weekend breaks as a time to reconnect and invest in our most important relationships in order to restore our work life balance and put the fun back into going away while lots of people take a break many are not actually taking a holiday it is vital we learn how to reprioritise and put work into a healthy perspective
8094530 what we have here is the ultimate short break location where every member of the family can unwind and have fun we feel its so important for parents and kids to focus on nothing more than having the best possible time we are prepared to take drastic action to ensure that parents really leave their work behind
8094531 theres always a huge debate on whether its nature or nurture that makes people the way they are and id suggest they both work together but parents are the key
8094532 youve got to allow his emotions to come out but give him ways of dealing with them
8094533 a lot of boys havent been allowed to do that so they get into problems because theyve never been able to express how they feel
8094534 youve got dysfunctional kids brought up by dysfunctional parents who were themselves brought up by dysfunctional parents and it just goes on and on
8094535 ive found this to be an amazing success i thought boys would fight it but they actually feel very secure with it often boys dont want to do stuff and their mates make them do it
8094536 the greatest thing a man can do is love the mother of his boys
8094537 when a boy sees that going on at home and hes told im so glad youre part of our team that helps him through those teenage years
8094538 parents dont need a big talk about the emotional make up of boys they just want hot tips that work and thats what ive tried to give them in the book
8094539 which way of disciplining children gets best results shouting and light smacking or modern techniques like the naughty stair and time out
8094540 in our study of 700 children we allowed half the mothers to bring them up from the age of one in the way they saw fit and the other half to attend parenting classes to learn what to expect of their childs development and how to manage misbehaviour
8094541 by the age of two parents who went to the classes were more likely to know what to expect of their childs development and less likely to use harsh and abusive discipline practices
8094542 however the children whose mothers went to parenting classes were no less naughty than the children whose mothers disciplined them their own way and their mothers were just as stressed
8094543 this suggests that a brief parenting programme isnt enough on its own to prevent child behaviour problems
8094544 research tells us that for minor behaviours such as whining or throwing a tantrum the best ways to respond include distraction ignoring or applying the logical consequences
8094545 for more serious behaviours such as hitting or biting quiet time or time out can be useful
8094546 its really encouraging to see mums are making the effort to give their babies an eco friendly start in life
8094547 being green should be a way of life for all the family and is a resolve that shouldnt be put off until tomorrow
8094548 working memory is the single most important predictor of learning much more so than iq
8094549 so when a teachers making comments like a childs a daydreamer or lazy it could be because the child doesnt have a big enough working memory they forget what they need to do so theyre not able to build up on learning
8094550 the tools provide a unique profile for the child that will help their teachers build up the best strategies to help them
8094551 on the other hand older children tend to be aware that they struggle with memory and they might have come up with strategies to improve it on their own
8094552 the value of working memory is that it actually measures a childs potential to learn not what theyve already learned
8094553 if we are to succeed in tackling bullying we need to break the culture of silence in which it thrives
8094554 although children and young people know that bullying is wrong they often find it difficult to act when they see it happen they may be afraid of being called a snitch or becoming a target for bullying themselves or they may simply not know what to do or who to turn to
8094555 we want children and young people to have the confidence to help stop bullying whenever and wherever they see it
8094556 and we want the adults in their lives to support them by reinforcing the message that all bullying is unacceptable
8094557 i was bullied at school and kept quiet for far too long but eventually i made the decision to tell people talking to my family empowered me and i want children and young people to hear the message something can be done about bullying
8094558 playing with fingers and toes and focusing on objects around them
8094559 this framework will help ensure that nurseries can truly make sure a child gets the best start in life
8094560 we especially welcome how its key principles promote the importance of ensuring that children are cared for in a loving and secure environment where they can enjoy developing at their own pace
8094561 we question how private and voluntary nurseries can support the cost of improvement without raising fees for parents
8094562 my concern is that carers are going to spend too much time teaching very young children to read and write instead of giving them the love and care they need the people that care for them cant do both
8094563 we want them to learn and develop but having a regimented curriculum is asking too much of such young children
8094564 more formal teaching and learning can put pressure on young children let them develop through the system weve already got
8094565 if children are selected for their own improvement and according to their needs it has to be to their advantage but if its to fast track children and put pressure on them before theyre ready it would be unfair
8094566 a lot of people need to realize that its just a game and part of my plan was to act and try to do whatever to win the money people dont know the pressure and the amount of stress that creates people dont know me and i hope they got a glimpse of the real me on house calls and the live show
8094567 parenting dramatically affects chemicals in the brain and the effects are long term
8094568 there are very clear proven connections between early stress and depression alcoholism and all the ills of society in later life
8094569 if you dont get your gaba from your parents you can turn to alcohol and get it there
8094570 if a child had a cut hand you wouldnt say hush distress tantrums need to be taken seriously and children need comforting or they become hard wired to affection some children seem to get away with it fine if theres not enough affection but in adolescence it puts a huge strain on them and they can go into depression and rage
8094571 but if you shout or scream repair it dont leave the child in a state of shock pick them up and bring down the state of alarm
8094572 modern life must be responsible in some way and part of the problem is that the transition into being a full adult takes a lot longer than it did 30 years ago
8094573 in some ways they grow up younger but they dont have the rights and responsibilities until theyre older
8094574 theres a clear link between emotional well being mental health and social mobility
8094575 its a major concern for us that childrens mental health problems are increasing and we want to help parents tackle it by showing them how to see children as children and not mini adults
8094576 its clear that the problems are connected to changes in our lifestyles that have impacted on children and increased the pressure on them
8094577 the rise in adolescent problems mainly bad behaviour and dishonesty rather than mental illness proper does coincide with a similar rise in wealth and income inequality in the uk over the same period
8094578 inequality affects everyone by increasing anxiety and insecurity so its not just a matter of tackling poverty even people with enough money are more likely to get ill physically and mentally if they have a lower status in a steeply unequal society
8094579 this gets increasingly difficult the older the child gets so its best to start early
8094580 parents need not feel ashamed at asking for help the earlier the better the message is dont suffer alone ask for parenting help and support
8094581 its never too late just harder the longer you leave it
8094582 sometimes its not spotted quickly if a childs not showing severe behaviour it may be put down to something else
8094583 it may be spotted when they dont progress well at school and dont make friends
8094584 people who are cynical about adhd are those who have no experience of it
8094585 its not to do with bad parenting theres a strong genetic link and were seeing more and more parents who were diagnosed with it as children
8094586 theres more awareness of it now and parents have a sense that somethings not right
8094587 before my son was diagnosed with adhd people told me i was a bad parent but he just didnt respond to any of my parenting skills
8094588 we should start by taking nutrition seriously not just in schools but also by stopping the nhs from allowing any more fast food outlets to open in hospitals 10 ways to beat lunchbox boredom
8094589 teachers are legally responsible for kids at school we dont let them smoke take drugs or carry weapons so we should also ban junk food from within the school gates this will send a message to parents that the issue has to be taken seriously condoning junk food in schools gives it an air of acceptability
8094590 eating well is vital to getting kids through the day it gives them energy helps them concentrate and prevents mood swings
8094591 their bodies need nutrients to grow and develop by eating the right foods they will look better and feel better and happier
8094592 food in schools has been neglected for so long we almost need to start again from scratch more than anything we need to start teaching kids how to cook again as well as the basics of nutrition in a positive practical way
8094593 outdoor physical exercise is also important this allows children to absorb vitamin d from the sun and strengthens bones in the long run teaching the uk population how to fuel their bodies adequately will save the government billions of pounds spent on treating preventable illnesses good nutrition plays such an important part in both our physical and mental wellbeing that it is economic suicide for a government to keep on ignoring the present trends
8094594 kids should be eating more antioxidant rich fruit and vegetables at the moment we are only advised to eat our five a day whereas in other countries they are told to eat nine or 10
8094595 the basics include wholegrain carbohydrates such as wholemeal pasta bread and rice for fibre b vitamins from wholemeal bread yeast extract and fortified cereals for immunity and minerals for the bones
8094596 meanwhile kids should avoid sugary and salty foods deep fried food excess saturated fats from red meat and dairy processed and hydrogenated fats additives and preservatives processed meats containing body parts such as udder intestine and rectum which amazingly have only just been banned in schools
8094597 parents are very conscious that what children learn at home will influence their life chances one of the best places to demonstrate this is at the table sharing a meal with the family eating good food and talking to each other
8094598 teaching manners is hard work its all about leading by example and persistence
8094599 you do need to sit at a table with the children to eat meals together at least three or four times a week they learn so much from that as its not just about eating its the social niceties too
8094600 thats not what theyre there for parents are the first teachers for their children and its well worth teaching them manners yourself
8094601 good manners are about respecting the people around you if you hold a door open for somebody it makes you smile as well as them
8094602 its like potty training suddenly it just clicks and then you only have to remind them occasionally
8094603 my son uses wi fi equipment at school and im worried it might damage his health am i right to be concerned
8094604 wi fi is short for wireless fidelity and is a type of wireless local area network wlan that is you dont need to plug your computer into a phone network via a cable
8094605 theres no evidence to date that exposure to the rf signals from wi fi and wlans adversely affect the health of the general population
8094606 the frequencies used are broadly the same as those from traditional rf applications
8094607 based on current knowledge rf exposures from wi fi are likely to be lower than those from mobile phones
8094608 experts believe that sunburn during childhood can double the risk of malignant melanoma the most dangerous form of cancer research uk
8094609 know how susceptible your children are dont let them read or draw in the car have plenty of sick bags to hand give them plenty of drinks and stop the car frequently for some fresh air
8094610 i have heard guys talk about bugaboo stroller colours like they were discussing the make and model of cars
8094611 the contraption is great but dads mostly love the colour
8094612 if you are going to use something like this to carry your baby around it had better be in a shade you can stand to look at
8094613 the notion there should be two colours for newborns light pink and blue is becoming obsolete
8094614 while light coloured baby gear still sells well pushchairs baby carriers and bags in colours like reds carbon greys and army green are enormously popular dads dont want to feel emasculated
8094615 my wife and i both like it because it gives you a hands free option
8094616 everybody worries to a certain extent but its when a child is worrying for a significant amount of time and when its interfering with their day to day life that it becomes a problem
8094617 in our clinic two thirds of parents experience anxiety problems its quite common
8094618 to support their children these parents have to show a positive model they dont have to hide their fears just show they can stop them
8094619 some children feel different because of their anxieties and its important for parents to help them understand its a natural emotion
8094620 parents are told lots of different things about anxiety disorders and often dont know what to do for the best
8094621 the aim of the book is to give them the confidence to tackle their childrens problems themselves
8094622 the death of maeve sheppard is an appalling tragedy but an exceptional one
8094623 parents should be reassured that the overwhelming majority of childminders do an excellent job and the 200 000 plus children in their care are safe happy and well cared for
8094624 all registered childcare settings childminders as well as nurseries are subject to a rigorous system of checks by ofsted to ensure their ratio of staff to children is appropriate and that theyre offering an environment which ensures that children are safe and happy
8094625 while every parent and childcare provider will feel the greatest sympathy with the sheppard family parents have every reason to feel confident that their children are safe in childcare
8094626 its about more than just keeping children safe its about their cognitive development as well
8094627 registration looks at whether the childminder is a suitable person for the job and at learning playing and developmental outcomes for the child
8094628 its an ongoing process and as well as keeping children safe it demonstrates to parents that the setting and the childminder are of quality
8094629 whatever the decision always remember that the vast majority of childminders provide an extremely safe and stimulating environment for children
8094630 our joint research identifies areas most at risk of obesity related conditions such as diabetes and heart disease through better health mapping we can now provide timely and relevant information to enable the more effective targeting of communications and the delivery of preventative care to social groups and neighbourhoods most at risk of obesity
8094631 we need to reduce levels of obesity and detailed health maps like these show where the risks of obesity are highest
8094632 this will enable health authorities to target weight loss drives in areas where this is a real problem to prevent people getting obesity related illnesses such as heart disease and late onset diabetes up until now they have not had access to this accurate database so this should really make a difference
8094633 children have been with their families and then come into close proximity with other children on arrival back at school this provides a perfect environment for the bugs which then pass from child to child
8094634 it is important to think about how to maintain your child in good health at all times which will help with their immunity
8094635 ensuring that your child has sufficient milk five portions of fruit or veg a day as recommended by the government and an adequate amount of exercise will put the child in a favourable position to fight infections
8094636 if you think a child may have scabies the child should go to their general practitioner who will first verify whether the child does have scabies or not and then prescribe the appropriate treatment all members of the household will need to be checked
8094637 in one day a child requires five portions of fruit and vegetables and some of this should be provided in the lunch box
8094638 try and reduce the amount of crisps and biscuits children take to school substitute them with healthy options such as fruit or yoghurts or yoghurt drinks
8094639 this interim adoption grants davids new parents temporary custody for 18 months during which time they will be evaluated by the courts of malawi per the tribal customs of the country
8094640 after learning that there were over one million orphans in malawi it was my wish to open up our home and help one child escape an extreme life of hardship poverty and in many cases death
8094641 we have gone about the adoption procedure according to the law
8094642 every adoptive parent has to go through months of checks whether theyre adopting from home or abroad and the final decision is taken by an assessment panel
8094643 we have to assume that if madonna will have gone through all those checks and been found to be suitable
8094644 all i hope is that madonna has done her homework because you really need to be properly prepared
8094645 for example a lot of children from abroad have attachment issues they may have been institutionalised for so long or passed between so many different carers that they find it difficult to form attachments or trust people that can affect their self esteem their confidence their ability to learn all of which can be overcome but adoptive parents have to be aware of the different challenges they face
8094646 in an ideal world my daughter would be in thailand with her birth parents or with a thai family
8094647 but it just wasnt an option those paths had failed
8094648 and there is a feeling among many who adopt from abroad that theyre really doing some good even if its just for one child care in britain may be far from perfect but in some countries orphanages just dont have the resources to offer any sort of childhood
8094649 its quite important for parents and children to enjoy themselves dont get too anxious and worried about what youre going to do its nice just to chill out together see it as a good opportunity to spend time with your children
8094650 parents bringing up their children alone and separated families in disagreement over where children will spend their time can also find the holidays stressful and depressing underlining the fact that the family has changed
8094651 it is hard when a freshly blended family or stepfamily is disrupted because one child has to be off with the other parent yet for some separated mothers and fathers it is the only period they have to spend extra time with their children
8094652 parents do get worried about it and overcompensate by filling every minute of every day but its good for kids to get bored sometimes theyre quite happy just sitting around parents should realise they dont need to over stimulate their children
8094653 parents get terribly worried it will be expensive but quite often children are happy to spend time with friends or having their friends around to play
8094654 its quite good to feel that you can wake up and think what are we going to do today its sunny lets go to the park or its raining lets go to the pictures thats what holidays are all about
8094655 my kids cant wait for the school holidays to start but i am dreading them i feel like a bad parent but i just dont know how i can cope with weeks of this
8094656 its important to acknowledge that the summer holidays can be a stressful time for all families
8094657 in addition to this parents may feel guilty about the limited amount of time they have available with their children or feel under pressure to take their children on holidays or days out during the summer that they cannot afford
8094658 but its important to relax and try and enjoy it yourself dont feel guilty if you pack the kids off for the day or get a sitter in for a night out other adults can bring in fresh entertainment for the kids too and it gives everyone a break
8094659 parents may need to talk over their options to realise that they arent alone in these dilemmas and that there is help at hand often just talking to someone about your worries can help which is why we encourage parents to call our 24 hour free confidential parentline on 0808 800 2222
8094660 theres no place like home you may not think of looking for adventure among the patio tubs behind the woodpile or even in the window box but its there in abundance
8094661 the trick is to change your perspective on life look at things from a different place and in a new way
8094662 a lot of the best and keenest naturalists i know are kids what i really want you to do is get out there get down on your hands and knees get your hands dirty look learn and enjoy
8094663 during our awareness week we aim to save lives by alerting people to the red flag symptoms and encouraging them to get symptom information from our helpline early diagnosis is crucial
8094664 she was really pale wasnt eating and was being sick meningitis so i knew the signs she was really floppy and didnt want to wake up and her hands were cold but she didnt have a rash
8094665 its vital to recognise the early symptoms even if you think youre being silly its best to get them checked out its better to be safe than sorry
8094666 these studies help us understand how the body communicates with the brain and why a healthy immune system is important for maintaining mental health they also leave us wondering if we shouldnt al be spending more time playing in the dirt
8094667 we must improve hygiene to reduce the impact of infectious diseases but at the same time we must learn how to safely train our immune system especially during infancy in order to prevent allergy
8094668 the supplemented milks are simply adding back something that was originally present breast milk contains leptin and formula feeds dont
8094669 this framework will help ensure that nurseries can truly make sure a child gets the best start in life
8094670 we know that everyone is against bullying yet it still goes on
8094671 there are many ways to take a stand for example young people can take a stand by walking away from bullies parents can take a stand by talking openly about bullying with their children and everyone else can take a stand by reporting bullying every time they witness it
8094672 we are all different but we deserve the same respect bullying messes you up it can shatter your self esteem and ruin your education whether you are being bullied or are a bully its no good just talking about what should be done you have to take a stand and do the right thing
8094673 however for the first time we are able to identify where the bullying is taking place and perhaps surprisingly for most young people it is taking place in the community not in school because of schools successes in beating bullying we are experiencing bullying migration to the community
8094674 its such a privilege to be a parent im a great believer in destiny and believe we were all destined to be together
8094675 i love hanging out with the kids and cooking for them i think deb is a brilliant actor and i think she should be doing more so ill definitely be doing a lot more mr mumming in the future
8094676 ive learned more from my daughter than she has learned from me
8094677 ive discovered finally what unconditional love is since she was born i wake up with a new joy and challenge called stella
8094678 i like to ski with my dad and i like that he plays the guitar and always has time to be with me
8094679 talk to her like shes an adult that way she doesnt hide things everything is open
8094680 ill have the sword out and demand what do you want from her
8094681 the thing about will is he learns every single day how to grow as an individual as a husband and as a father it surprises me the revelations he begins to have as a parent thats what parenthood is all about because these kids do not come with instructions
8094682 so polite its ridiculous thank you maam yes sir we demand it
8094683 theyre not supposed to watch tv during the school week but he lets them
8094684 everything that we wanted it to be it was spiritual it was powerful it was indescribable
8094685 my concern is being the best parent i can be
8094686 because i want them to know its important to work
8094687 i want to thank my daughter for telling me just before i got up here
8094688 quite a history of children not having good robust role models
8094689 rather good that at the moment from david cameron through to david beckham weve got quite a lot of good public images of fathers taking their fathering seriously
8094690 they are the most important thing in his life he just wont allow anything to harm them
8094691 they are good girls great fun really a total pleasure
8094692 im like a total homebody just hanging out with my kids
8094693 since becoming a parent ive been looking for films that the kiddies can watch
8094694 school holidays can be a nightmare because theyre home either rushing around burning up energy and wanting to eat all the time or lounging around and just want to graze and eat small amounts throughout the day
8094695 whatever the solution is to have great grub ready prepared and a selection of recipes at your fingerprints of make in minutes dishes ideally let kids help themselves when they feel like it and dont forget to make enough so that if their friends turn up theres plenty on offer
8094696 forgive me if i occasionally sleeping in after a tough week
8094697 we need greater recognition of the deeper impact eczema can have on a persons life to help improve the medical advice and understanding that patients receive life with eczema can be very difficult but with the right support and management it can also be lived to the full
8094698 it can also result in psychological difficulties for sufferers and their carers and it is important that people living with eczema is not contagious but it is prone to secondary infection by a bacteria called staphylococcus aureus which can make the eczema can make the skin dry hot and itchy and it can become broken raw and bleeding producing an urge to scratch which can be hard to resist whatever your age
8094699 conventional treatments include moisturisers and topical steroids however everyones skin is different and what helps one will not always help another
8094700 if not treated appropriately the skin may get more irritated and itchy leading to more scratching and damage to the skin which can be both emotionally and physically devastating
8094701 in order to help manage stress adopt a good skin care routine take regular exercise make time to relax and perhaps learn a relaxation technique such as deep breathing meditation visualisation yoga or tai chi
8094702 relaxation tapes and cds provide guided meditations and visualisations which can also help you to unwind
8094703 the term atopy refers to the atopic diseases which include atopic eczema hay fever in atopy the bodys immune system overreacts to things that would not normally do any harm such as house dust mite pollens moulds certain foods and animal dander
8094704 atopic eczema can begin in babies from about six weeks old and can continue throughout childhood but for reasons that are not clear three quarters of children grow out of atopic eczema around puberty
8094705 babies and children often rub their faces on bed sheets or clothing to relieve the itch and usually the skin is very itchy dry and red sometimes it is weepy and bleeding
8094706 but only if theyre bored and quite literally dont have a life
8094707 because im better at the computer game than i am at real golf
8094708 the computer games easier and more convenient you dont get wet and you dont have to talk to your golfing partners
8094709 more emotionally revved up than if they play non violent games
8094710 i have never felt any ill effects from playing games and if i found they were making me stressed or stopping me doing other things i would stop its just a bit of escapism and a bit of fun
8094711 role models are absolutely essential from the age of about two children start copying their parents and they are the most important role models
8094712 but as they become teenagers role models move from heroes to sex objects or people who look good they want them to be noble and heroic too
8094713 at the moment young teens are all looking to celebrities theyre the new gods
8094714 but negative images of wags focused on shopping drinking and bling can hold young women back
8094715 its much better if role models are achieving things rather than just aiming for money and glamour
8094716 if youre a parent who behaves like coleen spending lots of money and so on your children will think thats normal
8094717 but if you sit down with your children and talk to them remain a steady influence on their lives and encourage them to become their own person youll be their role model
8094718 a lot of kids even very young ones have picked up on this story and parents are wondering what they can do to reassure them and not frighten them
8094719 say you dont have to worry because i will keep you safe and show you are confident that you can look after them dont be anxious in a public place
8094720 these figures are no surprise to us we are rapidly becoming a nation bursting at the seams we are all going to have to work together to curb these figures and the risk to our nations health
8094721 not all people with diabetes are overweight but at diagnosis 80 of those diagnosed with type 2 diabetes were overweight if obesity rates continue to rise at such a rapid rate the number of deaths due to diabetes will increase in line with this
8094722 this is not to mention the blindness amputations and strokes which the condition can also lead to were delighted to see the commitment voiced by the government on tackling this huge problem but we want to see these words turned into actions
8094723 in the last few decades the portion sizes of food sold in shops and served in restaurants has grown tremendously a study by the word cancer research fund found that burgers have doubled in size since 1980 and pasta servings are about five times larger
8094724 to stop yourself putting more weight on and maybe lose some weight you will need to keep an eye on the amount of food you eat and think about cutting it down
8094725 fresh frozen chilled canned 100 juice and dried fruit and vegetables all count one portion of fruit is for example half a large grapefruit a slice of melon or two satsumas a glass of 100 juice counts as one portion but you can only count juice as one portion a day however much you drink
8094726 one portion is three tablespoonfuls of cooked carrots or peas or sweetcorn or one cereal bowl of mixed salad
8094727 the governments plans are right to an extent however i think its a case of the brain being willing but they have not made it compelling for children and teenagers
8094728 people will do what they want to do and kids are the worst for that take the traffic light food labelling system for example kids will just see that and eat red
8094729 four years is a long time for children and they wont care how healthy they are going to be then you cant just nag them into eating properly and exercising more
8094730 as the idea of shopping for fresh ingredients and cooking a meal seems like a real hassle many parents are also too scared to let their children play in the street and they therefore spend too much time in a car the truth is their kids are at more danger in a car
8094731 the obesity epidemic has crept up on us there is a misconception that children are eating more but its also because they dont exercise enough fitness should be a bigger issue especially with the olympics coming up with sport there should be something for everyone and we should be there to motivate them rather than just feeding them lots of information
8094732 in my opinion these sites breed insecurities which creates the illness said emma a bank cashier from stone staffs
8094733 people on them talk about celebrities they idolise like nicole richie and kate bosworth these stars have never admitted to having eating disorders but they are terrible role models and shouldnt be allowed on the cover of magazines they simply promote the illness
8094734 most of my friends were boys and a group of girls at school didnt like it she said
8094735 they would call me names and shout abuse at me every day which always included the word fat
8094736 i was only a size 12 and had never thought of myself as overweight but i started to think they were right they made my life a misery and i thought the only way to stop them was to lose weight
8094737 i desperately wanted to look like the skinny girls on catwalks and in magazines she said
8094738 i started by cutting out junk food then skipped breakfast and lunch my dad would make me sandwiches every day but id chuck them away id eat about half of my dinner just so my parents saw me eat
8094739 i was losing half a stone a week and i only drank water she said
8094740 i was doing 1 000 sit ups before i went to bed and i went to the gym every day
8094741 i had no idea how bad i looked all i could see was a big fat blob in the mirror id mistake protruding bones for rolls of fat and was convinced i was huge
8094742 it sounds strange but eating was the hardest thing ive ever had to do i still have to plan everything i eat now and i dont know if my obsession with food will ever stop
8094743 theyre two extremely strong people and most people view them as the head of the opposing teams
8094744 theyve gone back to big brother 2 by casting more villains more characters
8094745 legislation demands these ingredients are clearly labelled so consumers can make an informed choice about including additives in what they eat
8094746 many of the additives theyre looking at are completely unnecessary anyway they just dont need to be in childrens food there are natural alternatives but the colourings are added to disguise bland colours
8094747 read the small print and if there are lots of long chemical names you dont understand you have the choice to put that back on the shelf and choose something better
8094748 there does seem to be potential harm from some additives but some children will be more susceptible than others
8094749 if a parent suspects that additives may be causing their childs behaviour problems they may detect a pattern by charting what the child eats and their behaviour for a few weeks
8094750 if you can identify a particular food or drink thats causing it then obviously cut it out of their diet
8094751 babies need to learn social skills and common sense in addition to skills thatll help them in iq tests
8094752 babies need to touch taste see and smell as much as they can and parents should encourage it it might be annoying for a parent if a child puts its hands in its beans but it wants to know what they feel like
8094753 as adults we already know these things but a baby doesnt and its up to its parents to help it learn about the sensory world whenever its practical
8094754 while there are undeniably advantages of having great genes to start with nurture plays a key role in intellectual development
8094755 genes provide the raw material but you provide the environment that helps to build the structure
8094756 make the most of the time you have with your child and think how they can learn just from the ordinary things youre doing
8094757 so talk to them while youre doing things get toddlers to help if they can and remember that maximising their cleverness can be fun for both of you
8094758 our best advice with interviewing for conservative jobs is that the entire goal of your interview wardrobe should be to take the focus off your appearance and put the focus where it should be on your mind your accomplishments and the way you carry yourself

8094819 when we got married back in the ukraine for six month we had no children and thought we wouldnt have any kids at all
8094820 i said how could this happen me in the army and she is at home pregnant
8094821 i was young then and didnt take into account we had lived together a while
8094822 its a lot of work and we all get tired and its difficult from financial point of view
8094823 but we overcome the fear by looking forward to our children with love
8094824 it takes a great deal of work to raise all of the children on each level
8094825 education and upbringing plays a large role but the most important thing is love and a big heart
8094826 i talk to my friends and they are worried their family has only one child or two
8094827 they go home to nothing i come home from school and im never bored you always have something to do
8094828 our goal is to raise the children so when they grow up they will not be afraid of anything in life
8094829 i think if every family approaches it that way we will have a very healthy society
8094830 we sit all together put out the food and eat like a regular family
8094831 sometimes we wait for each other to finish and then feed the little kids
8094832 its impossible to say how many diapers weve changed because back in the ukraine we didnt have those things

8095068 at least two senators that i heard with my own ears cited this as a reason why they decided to vote to not allow a bipartisan majority to reauthorize the patriot act
8095069 well as it turns out the author of this article turned in a book three months ago and the paper the new york times failed to reveal that the urgent story was tied to a book release and its sale by its author
8095070 state of war the secret history of the cia and the bush administration
8095071 i think its a crying shame that we find that americas safety is endangered by the potential expiration of the patriot act in part because a newspaper has seen fit to release on the night before the vote on the floor on the reauthorization of the patriot act as part of a marketing campaign for selling a book
8095072 may pose a potential for a shock or fire hazard
8095073 a manufacturing defect may cause a malfunction of the light string resulting in overheating and possible melting in the encapsulated area of the light string
8095074 when i look at their lists i find it quite amazing usually kids ask for playstations or dvds these kids are asking for necessities

8095090 in the 70s it was a hippie dippie sexual revolution woodstock kind of gig flower children in many ways pot smokers though once in a while you would see cocaine or a pill most of them had been to college some have come from broken homes some from abusive homes
8095091 what i tell kids when i lecture in colleges is that porn is largely a microcosm of hollywood itself there were kids who wanted to do something goofy and crazy some were actors who wanted to go for an acting career like me and settled for this because acting was just a murderously difficult thing to get into its thousands of people chasing so few jobs with everyone driving a taxi working as a waiter
8095092 this will legalize roman candles rockets mortars shells and fire crackers and a few others anything that flies or goes bang
8095093 fireworks have become much much safer over the past few decades the statistics show that injuries are down
8095094 right now people are buying fireworks anywhere and west virginia is losing the sales tax and this 10 percent safety fee
8095095 theyre talking about 1 3 million in tax revenue but one fatality would totally negate that in terms of litigation
8095096 explosive fireworks have been shown in the hands of children to be inherently unsafe and part of this proposal is handing them out to kids under the age of 21 and requiring them to wear eye goggles but it wont help them if they blow off their hand
8095097 the movie is supposed to teach us that the education of our children will mean the future of our planet all the action scenes had a goal they were supposed to be driven by either a metaphysical point of view or experience for the characters instead parts of the movie are like a bad episode of 24
8095098 babylon will probably have a good first weekend but the second weekend were going to lose 30
8095099 i dont see how people who went through all these amazing blockbusters like the dark knight and iron man this summer will take it
8095100 you know it was once said of the first george bush that he was born on third base and thought hed hit a triple
8095101 well with the 22 million new jobs and the budget surplus bill clinton left behind george w bush came into office on third base and then he stole second
8095102 and john mccain cheered him every step of the way
8095103 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do
8095104 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8095105 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones
8095106 im very traumatized because i dont know if they are going to let my husband go and when i will see him
8095107 we have kids without dads and pregnant mothers who got their husbands taken away
8095108 it was like a horror story they got handled like they were criminals
8095109 ongoing investigation and yesterdays action was just the first part
8095110 runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for its jobs
8095111 it is company policy that it hires only u s citizens and legal immigrants
8095112 it was like a horror story they got handled like they were criminals
8095113 omg they are criminals folks they are stealing jobs from americans
8095114 but not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
8095115 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8095116 appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8095117 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground
8095118 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8095119 i didnt always comport myself in the way that i wanted to
8095120 america must stand firmly on the side of freedom and justice
8095121 ive never been a team i shouldve been a one man band
8095122 this is a significant racketeering case involving alleged criminal activity spanning the globe
8095123 i feel better than ever im excited ive got a whole new look on life i look at life on a whole nother radar
8095124 this may sound drastic but i have put it in gods hands and now have peace knowing that this is the best way to put this disease in check
8095125 i have complete faith that with the lords blessings this surgery will eliminate the cancer from my body and ill soon be back on the road doing what i do best
8095126 i know were at the democratic convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or a d next to it
8095127 because this election isnt about liberal versus conservative its not about left versus right its about the future versus the past
8095128 in george bush and john mccains america far too many
8095129 a plan that would explode the deficit that will be passed on to our kids no real plan to invest in our infrastructure and his plan would continue spending 10 billion a month in iraq
8095130 i dont know about you but thats not just right thats four more years that we cant just afford
8095131 old partisanship gives way to new ideas and hope replaces fear
8095132 and a whole lot of good folks who didnt see themselves as either democrats or republicans but as virginians
8095133 right now at this critical moment in our history we have one shot to get it right
8095134 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground we need leaders who will appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8095135 the race for the future is on and it wont be won if only some americans are in the running
8095136 it wont be won with yesterdays ideas and yesterdays divisions
8095137 and it wont be won with a president who is stuck in the past
8095138 we need a president who understands the world today the future we seek and the change we need we need barack obama
8095139 barack obama and john mccain have never had executive decision making experience ever
8095140 were not electing a rock star its not a vote to see whos the most charismatic
8095141 barack obama and joe biden are committed to producing enough homegrown fuel to replace every drop of the oil we import from the middle east and venezuela in just 10 years an obama administration will invest 4 billion to keep america in the car making business and give you a tax cut so you can buy a fuel efficient car or truck
8095142 its time for a president who will bring our jobs back and bring our troops home for the change we need its time for barack obama
8095143 what we need is someone who can step right in and do something right away clinton has an amazing ability to adjust
8095144 she and i are very good friends and i think she will be the best president when i sign up to support a candidate its to the end
8095145 there is only one candidate who will make the change that we need to restore the promise of america he is a man of integrity he is a man of honesty he loves his country he is barack obama
8095146 the only thing we have to fear is fear itself
8095147 warner get a real job no ones going to want a phone in the car
8095148 i like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past
8095149 having another high capacity mill in operation will shorten the grinding season for other mills lengthen our growing season and increase the value of our crop
8095150 high energy prices have led to an increase in biodiesel production which in turn has led to an increase in the amount of crude glycerol in the market
8095151 we have shown that it is possible to use the crude glycerol byproduct from the biodiesel industry as a carbon source for microalgae that produce omega 3 fatty acids
8095152 after thorough chemical analysis we have also shown that the algae biomass composition has the same quality as the commercial algae product
8095153 apakah anda telah melihat iklan baru iklan kampanye mccain yang menyamakan barack obama dengan britney spears dan paris hilton dan sekarang kampanye obama mengeluarkan iklan yang menyamakan john mccain dengan zsa zsa gabor dan bea arthur
8095154 apakah mccain telah menonton video seksnya paris hilton di video itu tak ada kata kata yang ada action semuanya
8095155 putri john mccain mengumumkan bahwa ia akan menulis buku anak anak berdasarkan riwayat hidup ayahnya
8095156 is a soldiers death honorable even if he fights in an unpopular war
8095157 even his officers had a hard time believing he joined just because he wanted to serve his country they are so used to seeing kids influenced by sex drugs and rock and roll that at first they thought he joined to get the scholarship freebie on the other end
8095158 is a soldiers death honorable even if he fights in an unpopular war
8095159 well the other big political story if you believe there are two americas then john edwards is in trouble in both of them do you know about this the mainstream media is now starting to report a story that was first broken by the national enquirer that john edwards was caught leaving his girlfriends hotel room at the beverly hilton hotel at 2 00 in the morning the woman had a room at the beverly hilton so at least he is not another politician screwing the poor
8095160 well heres the latest on john edwards vice presidential chances too much vice not enough presidential have you heard this story the mainstream media is now starting to report on a story that was first broken by the national enquirer this week the national enquirer claimed they caught john edwards visiting his mistress at 2 40 in the morning at the beverly hills hotel monday night and when a team of reporters confronted him he ran and hid in the mens room and you know who was in there senator larry craig what are the odds
8095161 how about this john edwards thing imagine that a personal injury attorney who turns out to be a sleaze ball who could have seen that coming
8095162 john edwards has admitted to having an affair but hes denying that he is the father of the womans baby in fact he says a member of his campaign staff is the babys father campaign staff how does that work what was edwards running late that day huh had to send an advance man in look i cant have sex with you im sending bob down
8095163 i thought this was nice at one point during the olympic ceremony tonight they had 56 children march in all belonging to john edwards
8095164 i guess edwards apparently met this woman at a new york city bar in 2006 and he is a pretty smooth operator
8095165 no he actually said today about the other woman he doesnt love her oh thats smart now youve got two women mad at you great way to go
8095166 you know what it turns out she was his campaign videographer yeah there you go think therell be a sex tape coming soon huh
8095167 well democrats are furious theyre going on record now saying john edwards will not be allowed to speak at the convention because of this affair yeah instead speaking in his place bill clinton you have to put your foot down
8095168 in fact when john mccain heard about the john edwards affair he said well thank god i cant get an erection anymore whew some problems just take care of themselves
8095169 i have a unique perspective on this like many you you i was the first person in my family to go to college
8095170 millions of americans have lost their jobs their homes their health care their pensions trillions of dollars for an unnecessary war paid with borrowed money tens of billions of dollars in cash and weapons disappeared into thin air at the cost of the lives of our troops and innocent iraqis while all the presidents oilmen are maneuvering to grab iraqs oil borrowed money to bomb bridges in iraq afghanistan and pakistan no money to rebuild bridges in america money to start a hot war with iran now we have another cold war with russia while the american economy has become a game of russian roulette
8095171 the insurance companies took over health care wake up america the pharmaceutical companies took over drug prices wake up america the speculators took over wall street wake up america we went into iraq for oil and now they want to drill more into your wallet wake up america this administration can tap our phones but they cant tap our creative spirit they can open our mail but they cant open economic opportunities they can track our every move but they lost track of the economy
8095172 wake up america this is not a call for you to take a new direction from right to left this is call for you to go from down to up up with the rights of workers up with wages up with fair trade up with creating millions of good paying jobs rebuilding our bridges ports and water systems up with creating millions of sustainable energy jobs to lower the cost of energy lower carbon emissions and protect the environment up with health care for all up with education for all up with home ownership up with guaranteed retirement benefits up with peace up with prosperity up with the democratic party up with obama biden

8095183 ya quisiera alg n partido u ong tener tanta influencia
8095184 los pueblos ind genas no se oponen al desarrollo sino que quieren ser incluidos en sus propios t rminos y esto no comprende el gobierno

8095191 estamos tratando de obtener la mayor informaci n y yo he reforzado la cantidad de funcionarios para ver si podemos detener a las personas que corresponden de acuerdo a las instrucciones de los fiscales
8095192 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
8095193 con frecuencia todos los hechos que suceden en el sur del pa s con absoluta ligereza e irresponsabilidad se las atribuyen a los mapuche esta situaci n reiterada obedece por un lado al racismo hist rico con los mapuche y por otro responde a los intereses de los grupos econ micos y particularmente por quienes han participado en actos de despojo territorial y ltimamente el aprovechamiento pol tico y la agitaci n del senador alberto espina
8095194 exigimos respeto por los derechos de los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos mapuche considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad donde los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos son objetos de actos de violencia institucional los hechos de violencia institucional se repiti en el allanamiento del d a domingo 24 de agosto en donde resultaron varios ni os mujeres y ancianos con asfixias y lesiones esta situaci n sucede porque carabinero act a bajo la doctrina del enemigo mapuche
8095195 a ra z del descontrol y los ataques indiscriminados de carabineros en contra de los mapuche result herido con balines el sargento edgardo alvarado esta elocuente situaci n pone de relieve y desmiente la participaci n de los mapuche en actos de violencia
8095196 denunciamos la agitaci n para el uso de la violencia institucional de parte del senador alberto espina unidos al gremio de agricultores agrupados en la sofo y muchos de ellos actores de la usurpaci n de tierras mapuche asimismo el gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n quienes han venido haciendo apolog a publica sobre la violencia amenazas reiteradas para el uso de las arma de fuego en contra de los mapuche
8095197 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos vinculados a los agricultores a las empresas forestales y el propio estado chileno
8095198 en vista que el estado chileno no ha protegido nuestros derechos el aumento del racismo odioso de los agricultores de las empresas forestales de los camioneros y la agitaci n de algunos parlamentarios en esta oportunidad concurriremos a la jurisdicci n internacional y a los mecanismos de protecci n a los derechos humanos para solicitar medidas cautelares a favor de las comunidades y la protecci n de los ni os mujeres y ancianos mapuche
8095199 el pueblo mapuche tiene la amplia disposici n para el di logo en la medida que el derecho a la autodeterminaci n el autogobierno mapuche y el territorio sean los ejes fundamentales del di logo

8095259 lets elect barack obama and joe biden for the future that our country deserves
8095260 it makes sense that john mccain will be with president bush in the twin cities because theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8095261 we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8095262 i cannot wait to see barack obama sign into law a health care plan that covers every single american

8095274 i know were at the democratic convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or a d next to it
8095275 because this election isnt about liberal versus conservative its not about left versus right its about the future versus the past
8095276 in george bush and john mccains america far too many
8095277 a plan that would explode the deficit that will be passed on to our kids no real plan to invest in our infrastructure and his plan would continue spending 10 billion a month in iraq
8095278 i dont know about you but thats not just right thats four more years that we cant just afford
8095279 old partisanship gives way to new ideas and hope replaces fear
8095280 and a whole lot of good folks who didnt see themselves as either democrats or republicans but as virginians
8095281 right now at this critical moment in our history we have one shot to get it right
8095282 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground we need leaders who will appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8095283 the race for the future is on and it wont be won if only some americans are in the running
8095284 it wont be won with yesterdays ideas and yesterdays divisions
8095285 and it wont be won with a president who is stuck in the past
8095286 we need a president who understands the world today the future we seek and the change we need we need barack obama
8095287 take care of my buddies a lot of them are still over there and then will you please help take care of me
8095288 i cant feel my legs and ive still got fucking glitter on me
8095289 but the great politically correct ones say that man in the center of the universe if you voice disagreement you must be lying
8095290 as a fan of robert bakker though who still uses the term brontosaurus and argues against the classification change that eliminated it stu would refer to brontosaurs as exactly that
8095291 to add insult to injury the poor brontosaurus not only got a name change but it was discovered that he had the wrong head too one item that was not found in the excavation with marshs yale skeleton was a skull marsh mounted a head found at a different location to complete the exhibit for many years scientists suspected that marsh had gotten the wrong skull but it wasnt until 1970 that two scientists john mcintosh from wesleyan university and david berman of the carnegie museum proved it the head that marsh had mounted was from another sauropod named camarasaurus the proper brontosaurus apatosaurus skull actually had a slightly longer snout and looked a lot like the skull of another sauropod called diplodocus
8095292 arent scientists supposed to be more rational than latching on to the first idea that pops into their heads
8095293 fulfill my fathers kind of crazy sounding dreams and wishes
8095294 i liked the story but i sort of groaned when it was revealed the wife was a time traveller i thought the story was really about stu s obsession about finding a time traveller for him to do so seemed a bit like wish fulfillment but in the end it worked because despite the revelation his obsession continued and was never fulfilled if he had ended up going back in time it would ve just seemed hacky
8095295 hes trying to fool me into thinking the femur is stus but it cant be
8095296 before we begin the program i wanted to say a few words about my good friend cong stephanie tubbs jones last week we learned the painful news that stephanie had died at the age of 58 stephanie was a true champion of civil rights and women her infectious enthusiasm for life and her unbridled love of people energized all who met her in june she spoke at the emilys list lunch in washington and we wanted to honor stephanie by sharing with you her remarkable spirit let your spirit soar my friend id now like to welcome our home congresswoman diana degette of denver to lead us in the pledge of allegiance thank you congresswoman gwen moore and thank you all for joining today with emilys list to celebrate the power of women to rebuild a progressive america democrats went through an historic nominating process in 2008 watching two strong and determined candidates battle for votes in every state barack obama came out the winner and i congratulate him he is an inspirational leader ready to take our country in a new direction we are honored to have michelle obama here with us today she is an extraordinary talented young working mom an attorney who has built important bridges between her community and the university of chicago medical center voters across the country are going to love getting to know michelle and theyll learn that both obamas understand the pressures facing families today and both will continue to work hard to make america a better place to raise our children and what a great choice in the addition of sen joe biden to the ticket this week democrats will also show america that we have nominated an exciting experienced team that can lead this country forward are you ready to win in november are you ready to unleash the political power of women to take our country back make no mistake about it emilys list members you in this room democrats and progressives across the country are united we will elect barack obama president of the united states though she did not get our partys nomination i believe in many ways hillary clinton came out of that nominating process as a winner she showed the world that women can compete at the very highest level of american politics she was eloquent and tough with the strength of an olympian i want to thank my friend hillary clinton for her passion and commitment to our country hillary you make us very proud next january when president obama is sworn into the white house he will begin the difficult job of rebuilding our country we have no illusions we know the special interests and the republicans will stop at nothing to block change thats why we have two goals in 2008 elect a democratic president and build working democratic majorities in congress and in the states to overcome gop resistance and get things done we know the phenomenal job speaker nancy pelosi has done to begin to move this country forward under her leadership democrats have raised the minimum wage extended unemployment benefits boosted spending for student loans and the gi bill of rights and increased fuel efficiency standards but think how much more can be done when the republicans cant use their delaying tactics or the filibuster to block change universal healthcare for all investments in a new green economy pay equity and paid sick leave and so much more the republicans stood in the way of progress in the last congress so we will stand together to defeat the republicans at the polls in 2008 we will elect a working democratic majority to help president obama create change thats why emilys list is supporting democratic candidates who can help move our country forward women like jeanne shaheen of new hampshire and kay hagen of north carolina who can take republican senate seats or betsey markey here in colorado who is going to defeat cong marilyn musgrave women candidates with your support will have the power to create change and i suggest you got to emilyslist org to learn more about the women who can win in november the victories of all democratic candidates men and women from barack obama running for president to candidates like camille ryckman running for the colorado legislature all those candidates depend on the decisions of women voters and thanks to your support today emilys list women vote will be able to reach out to 6 5 million women and show them how they can make a profound difference in their lives and the lives of their families by electing the democratic ticket women vote will send an important message to first time voters if youre excited about voting for barack obama for president and we know you are dont forget to vote for other democratic candidates on the ballot because he needs them as his partners in rebuilding a progressive america every woman has the power to change the direction of this country by casting her ballot for barack obama and the democrats so reach out to your friends and family and tell them how they can rebuild our country by supporting our candidates in november you and i through emilys list will unleash the power of women the power of women candidates and the power of women voters in november this is our country and together united we will use the power of women to rebuild a progressive america in 1986 only 11 election cycles ago emilys list had our first election and we did something extraordinary we helped barbara mikulski become the first democratic woman ever elected to the united states senate in her own right sen mikulski has shown us over and over why we believe that if you give democratic women political power they will use it to build a progressive america she has been a stalwart supporter of working people has forced equal treatment for women in health research and as dean of the women in the senate has led the fight for legislation that helps women and families please welcome senator barbara mikulski

8095340 before you criticize someone you should walk a mile in their shoes that way when you criticize them youre a mile away and you have their shoes
8095341 sai non decido io a giugno eravamo rimasti daccordo che ci sarebbe stata una conferma e per per una questione di correttezza per ora posso dartela solo in via ufficiosa ti sapr dire entro domani al massimo dopodomani
8095342 before you criticize someone you should walk a mile in their shoes that way when you criticize them youre a mile away and you have their shoes
8095343 you have become estranged from christ you who attempt to be justified by law you have fallen from grace
8095344 i will not not or never never cast out without
8095345 he who comes from above is above all he who is of the earth is from the earth and speaks of the earth
8095346 what he has seen and heard of that he testifies and no one receives his testimony
8095347 he who has received his testimony has set his seal to this that god is true
8095348 for he whom god has sent speaks the words of god for he gives the spirit without measure
8095349 the father loves the son and has given all things into his hand
8095350 he who believes in the son has eternal life but he who does not obey the son will not see life but the wrath of god abides on him
8095351 for just as the father raises the dead and gives them life even so the son also gives life to whom he wishes
8095352 for not even the father judges anyone but he has given all judgment to the son 23 so that all will honor the son even as they honor the father
8095353 truly truly i say to you he who hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and does not come into judgment but has passed out of death into life
8095354 i am the bread of life he who comes to me will not hunger and he who believes in me will never thirst
8095355 but i said to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe
8095356 all that the father gives me will come to me and the one who comes to me i will certainly not cast out
8095357 for i have come down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him who sent me
8095358 this is the will of him who sent me that of all that he has given me i lose nothing but raise it up on the last day
8095359 for this is the will of my father that everyone who beholds the son and believes in him will have eternal life and i myself will raise him up on the last day
8095360 i told you and you do not believe the works that i do in my fathers name these testify of me
8095361 but you do not believe because you are not of my sheep
8095362 my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me 28 and i give eternal life to them and they will never perish and no one will snatch them out of my hand
8095363 my father who has given them to me is greater than all and no one is able to snatch them out of the fathers hand
8095364 father the hour has come glorify your son that the son may glorify you 2 even as you gave him authority over all flesh that to all whom you have given him he may give eternal life
8095365 this is eternal life that they may know you the only true god and jesus christ whom you have sent
8095366 all the authority that the father giveth me shall come unto me and him that cometh unto me i will no wise cast out
8095367 before you criticize someone you should walk a mile in their shoes that way when you criticize them youre a mile away and you have their shoes
8095368 all the authority that the father giveth me shall come unto me and him that cometh unto me i will no wise cast out
8095369 before you criticize someone you should walk a mile in their shoes that way when you criticize them youre a mile away and you have their shoes

8095374 the tiniest boys and girls should be loved and protected
8095375 but as nominating barack obama emphasizes the dnc even supports killing kids in the womb old enough to know their mothers voice sleep and dream suck their thumbs and play with their toes
8095376 when we tell kids that unborn children can be killed if their parents dont want them
8095377 we rob them of the knowledge of the god given right to life and we destroy their moral foundation abortion is wrong because its a baby its always wrong to intentionally kill an innocent baby
8095378 feminism is a socialist anti family political movement that encourages women to leave their husbands kill their children practice witchcraft destroy capitalism and become lesbians
8095379 the moment you lose the ability to sense your own absurdity
8095380 i do not set aside the grace of god for if righteousness comes through the law then christ died in vain
8095381 all who ever came before me are thieves and robbers but the sheep did not hear them
8095382 i am the door if anyone enters by me he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture 1 cor 10 1 12
8095383 the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play
8095384 it is the spirit who gives life the flesh profits nothing the words that i speak to you are spirit and they are life john 4 23 24
8095385 but the hour is coming and now is when the true worshipers will worship the father in spirit and truth for the father is seeking such to worship him
8095386 god is spirit and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth
8095387 sanctify them by your truth your word is truth john 3 34
8095388 for he whom god has sent speaks the words of god for god does not give the spirit by measure john 3 33
8095389 he who has received his testimony has certified that god is true john 3 35 36
8095390 the father loves the son and has given all things into his hand
8095391 he who believes in the son has everlasting life and he who does not believe the son shall not see life but the wrath of god abides on him
8095392 but the helper the holy spirit whom the father will send in my name he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all things that i said to you gal 2 19 21
8095393 for i through the law died to the law that i might live to god
8095394 i have been crucified with christ it is no longer i who live but christ lives in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by faith in the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me
8095395 i do not set aside the grace of god for if righteousness comes through the law then christ died in vain
8095396 all who ever came before me are thieves and robbers but the sheep did not hear them

8095478 het werk werd aangekocht bij een antwerpse familie die via een tussenpersoon te kennen gaf het werk te willen verkopen
8095479 de initi le vraagprijs bedroeg 3 miljoen euro deze ensor is zeker geen koopje maar het is een prachtig werk waar de vlaamse overheid een correcte prijs voor betaalde ensor zelf gaf in een terugblik op zijn schildersloopbaan kinderen aan het ochtendtoilet aan als een mijlpaal in zijn ontwikkeling
8095480 het werk situeert zich tussen de donkere periode van de vroege jaren en de expressionistische werken van de late jaren 1880 kinderen aan het ochtendtoilet is de conclusie van een reeks intimistische werken en typisch voor ensor meteen ook het eindpunt het nec plus ultra james ensor geeft in kinderen aan het ochtendtoilet een voor die tijd ongewone interpretatie aan een klassiek thema als het naakt in een interieur de badsc ne en het thema van de jeugd waardoor hij vooruitloopt op latere ontwikkelingen bij symbolisten en expressionisten
8095481 door zijn plaats in onze kunstgeschiedenis verdiende het om permanent voor het publiek toegankelijk te zijn al te veel werken van dat niveau zijn immers al uit ons land verdwenen en vele musea en priv verzamelingen in het buitenland bezitten meesterwerken met een vlaamse herkomst zo draagt ensors intrede van christus in brussel in het getty museum in los angeles ongetwijfeld bij tot de uitstraling van de vlaamse kunst in de wereld maar het blijft ontzettend jammer dat dit kapitale werk niet permanent in een vlaams museum te zien is indien de vlaamse gemeenschap kinderen aan het ochtendtoilet niet had aangekocht dan was het hoogstwaarschijnlijk vertrokken naar het buitenland of opnieuw verdwenen in een besloten priv verzameling

8095483 many dont agree with my assertion that speculation has little or nothing to do with the run up in oil prices and consider that the brutal price increases followed by just as brutal price decreases cannot be explained by fairly small changes in supply or demand figures

8095488 you get a list of routes below and the start of the routes marked on the map
8095489 muslims in the west are finding they can practice islam without pressure from islamic governments so here in the uk both dangerous islamists and freethinking reformers are emerging
8095490 the west is now the crucible in which islam is being openly debated and modified for the 21st century i suggest the outcome of the debate in this country that is going on between muslims could well affect the outcome for the future of islam worldwide
8095491 two prisoners whose cells adjoin communicate with each other by knocking on the wall the wall is the thing which separates them but it is also their means of communication it is the same with us and god every separation is a link
8095492 if you dont believe me read that bible thing people keep going on about
8095493 its worth remembering that in the 1940s penicillin was so expensive because we didnt know how to purify it very well that it was recycled from the urine of those receiving it today
8095494 if you meet the buddha on the road kill him
8095495 our muslim neighbours view us as completely infidel they think what we are doing in the church is completely evil
8095496 the market gives people what the people want instead of what other people think they ought to want at the bottom of many criticisms of the market economy is really lack of belief in freedom itself
8095497 put the catch pole around the donuts and just sat downwind of it so he couldnt smell me and sat just out of the light so there wasnt shadows

8095500 theyre probably going to be doing a lot of wrestling a lot of chasing each other things that will help them develop their muscles and their skills
8095501 a national hero on the ticket would help mccain out immensely
8095502 whos the latest american hero the man whose hard work and perseverance have most recently shown the american can do spirit the golden boy himself michael phelps
8095503 its just amazing what this young man can do my friends
8095504 i used to swim in a slurry of urine and feces when i was a pow and while i never won any medals i considered myself pretty fast but not as fast as matthew uh michael phelps and he didnt even have the motivation of bamboo under his fingernails to drive him on no siree
8095505 michael is only 23 and the constitution requires that the vice president be at least 35 years old just in case his running mate dies of old age or something
8095506 now you can talk the democrats in congress into just about anything these days so lowering the age requirement or maybe even using a president vp age averaging system are both very possible
8095507 in the latter case the mccain phelps age would be i dunno sixty something well over the requirement
8095508 organizar un campeonato y jugarlo es complicado hay muchas cosas por hacer no ten s tiempo para descansar aunque igualmente la prioridad es trabajar en los aspectos que hacen al torneo pero estoy contento porque el p blico apoya y porque todo est saliendo b rbaro

8095515 john mccain calls himself a maverick but he votes with george bush more than 90 percent of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick

8095518 la dif cil coyuntura de las cooperativas el ctricas y emsa debe ser soportada con un incremento tarifario y con un mecanismo solidario en donde los sectores de mayor capacidad econ mica efect en los mayores aportes y el incremento resulte el m nimo posible compatibiliz ndose con el sostenimiento del servicio a todos los sectores de la actividad econ mica y de la poblaci n especialmente a la de menores recursos
8095519 no alcanza para cubrir los gastos que deben afrontar las entidades pero viene a paliar un poco la situaci n cr tica de muchas cooperativas
8095520 very honored for voters to have chosen me its really overwhelming first time i ran for office its just really overwhelming
8095521 we presented our alternative to voters as far as what issues we thought were important and mr cameron presented his and voters made their decision and we respect
8095522 i think more training more focusing on what our strengths are and more focusing on accountability so theyre on paper for the entire community to see thats the direction were making
8095523 this is not a debate about abortion this is about the baby bonus being misused and misapplied to women who do have terminations
8095524 clearly that is not the intention its not in keeping with the support of mainstream australians for the baby bonus
8095525 i think it is a very humane gesture from society to say you are going through enough already were not going to withhold the bonus
8095526 if there is any evidence of this occurring we will follow it up immediately
8095527 our research disputes a major pillar holding up the long held assumption that homo sapiens were more advanced than neanderthals
8095528 it is time for archaeologists to start searching for other reasons why neanderthals became extinct while our ancestors survived
8095529 technologically speaking there is no clear advantage of one tool over the other when we think of neanderthals we need to stop thinking in terms of stupid or less advanced and more in terms of different
8095530 colonising a continent isnt easy colonising a continent during the ice age is even harder so for early homo sapiens colonising ice age europe a new shared and flashy looking technology might serve as one form of social glue by which larger social networks were bonded he said
8095531 thus during hard times these larger social networks might act like a type of life insurance ensuring exchange and trade among members of the same team
8095532 hi leigh i just wanted to say that you are so funny i know you can piss people off but i love it never change

8095540 tropical island in many car owners is just a dream including me
8095541 umm i think that we are all beginning to lose sight of the real issue here which is what are we going to call ourselves and i think it comes down to a choice between the league against salivating monsters or my own personal preference which is the committee for the liberation and integration of terrifying organisms and their rehabilitation into society one fallback with that the abbreviation is clitoris
8095542 she is female which addresses the novelty of the opposition she is smart and well respected she is knowledgeable on key issues especially domestic policy
8095543 i still think its going to be former massachusetts governor mitt romney
8095544 shes been around for decades and is not going to start making mistakes now
8095545 her nomination would be a signal to american women that mccain takes their aspirations seriously even if obama does not hutchison is not charismatic but her circumstances would be if she were nominated the prospect of a woman vice president would electrify women throughout the nation
8095546 she has clearly set her sights on governor and looks at that as the way she wants to complete her long and distinguished career of public service
8095547 the conservatives could probably stomach hutchison a lot better than a tom ridge or joe lieberman
8095548 she is a woman and their strategy seems to be to go for disaffected hillary clinton voters but i would say this is more like the chet edwards boomlet it raises the profile there is no downside to being mentioned but hutchison at this point looks like a last minute ploy not a considered judgment
8095549 ok shes not a dynamo of fiery charisma in fact as ive noted before shes a bland and sometimes boring speaker and a pleasant if unprepossessing television presence nevertheless she is a she and that fact in itself would allow mccains choice to upstage obamas
8095550 she wouldnt add much to the slate but she is a southerner and female
8095551 some people think kay bailey hutchison in texas i think thats unlikely
8095552 sta ser una experiencia completamente nueva para todos nosotros somos un cuerpo t cnico joven que debuta en la categor a as que no le vamos a esquivar el bulto por esa es la realidad con respecto al equipo logramos conjugar tres atletas con mucha experiencia y un grupo bastante joven con ambici n
8095553 la meta est formada por la dirigencia y por el cuerpo t cnico pero yo ser la cabeza responsable que va a hacer lo imposible para que el equipo pueda mantener la categor a estoy seguro de que eso no ser f cil pero si luego de varios partido el plantel da para m s lo analizaremos a medida en que pase el campeonato
8095554 this was an endlessly fascinating process already and its still got some twists and turns between now and november
8095555 but underneath that and in the background there is also a different story which we dont want to unearth much on the convention floor because its not really what were trying to do but which you should be mindful of
8095556 no single guide telling us where to go with this
8095557 the project was born already obsolete in technological organizational and conceptual terms

8095568 over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
8095569 speaker of the house nancy pelosi is a gifted public servant of strong convictions and many professional skills
8095570 regrettably knowledge of catholic history and teaching does not seem to be one of them
8095571 is always gravely evil and so are the evasions employed to justify it
8095572 its a two hour test given once a year and its just a small piece of what we are all about and thats creating well rounded kids
8095573 we have to make the most of the pockets of excellence we have to really focus the energy and resources in those pockets on improving the rest of the district
8095574 teachers have to teach to the students at the top of class the at risk students and the students in between
8095575 our veteran teachers work very hard and have learned how to do that that is why they are held in high regard here
8095576 we want to differentiate instruction and teach to ensure the success of every single kid
8095577 in many ways the work of a critic is easy we risk very little yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment we thrive on negative criticism which is fun to write and to read but the bitter truth we critics must face is that in the grand scheme of things the average piece of junk is more meaningful than our criticism designating it so but there are times when a critic truly risks something and that is in the discovery and defense of the new the world is often unkind to new talent new creations the new needs friends
8095578 i remember that a soldier is just a uniform following orders a warrior is the man or woman that follows their conscience and does the right thing in the face of adversity

8095586 today the multinational corps iraq is operating in more areas of the country with fewer troops and our security gains continue to trend in a positive direction even after the redeployment of five brigade combat teams and most recently the georgian brigade weve been able to achieve this success because of an increasingly effective iraqi security force one that is growing in capability and in confidence
8095587 the suicide bombing of jalawla is striking evidence that iraqi security forces are unable to impose security on the area from which peshmerga have just withdrawn
8095588 the suicide bombing of jalawla is striking eveidence that iraqi security forces are unable to impose security on the are from which pershmerga have just withdrawn
8095589 this is the latest in a series of attacks launched mainly by sunni islamists in diyala
8095590 the attack followed a suicide bombing on sunday night at a tribal sheiks banquest in the western baghdad suburb of abu ghraib
8095591 prime minister nouri malikis negotiators are also bogged down in talks over a long term security agreement with the united states despite a december deadline looming for a deal the shiite led government has also initiated a crackdown on leaders and members of the u s funded sons of iraq movement which includes many former insurgents who allied themselves with america in 2007 to fight al qaeda in iraq since may iraqi security forces have started arresting sunni fighters leaders from the sons of iraq have warned that the measures could drive some of their men back to fighting the government
8095592 fixed deadline for the departure of all u s troops troops from iraq
8095593 his words appeared to rule out the presence of any u s military advisors special forces and air support after the withdrawal date
8095594 a direct challenge to the bush administration which insists that the timing for troop departure would be based on conditions on the ground
8095595 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
8095596 despite the tough words aides insisted a compromise could be found on the two main stumbling blocks to an accord governing the u s military presence in iraq after a united nations mandate expires at the end of the year

8095599 but it is usually the job of the party nominee to build unity once a vanquished rival has conceded and made the right gestures unless the loser happens to be a woman then its just like high school and she must do the work
8095600 we must have an opposition party in this country and the green party with over 200 elected officials on the local level can be that opposition but we have to expand and broaden the green party to reflect the entire fabric of all of the communities that are in this country we have done a great job of reaching out to people of all diverse backgrounds and we wanted to make sure that people understood that not only is green party a viable alternative it is imperative
8095601 were hoping for 5 000 people and we want the mood to be thoroughly democratic and we want the peopl to feel inspired about voting for candidates who actually represent them
8095602 these new estimates are a major advance in poverty measurements because they are based on far better price data for assuring that the poverty lines are comparable across countries
8095603 it looks like were slowly starting to dig out of this
8095604 over the past few weeks many people have contacted me reaching out to me everywhere from meetings to grocery stores to just driving through my neighborhood or walking on the beach telling me to keep fighting
8095605 but this has been physically and emotionally draining on me and my family the decision about whether to fight this will be made with my family over the next few days
8095606 there are some issues with the affidavit and i can file an injunction based on those but that requires i hire an attorney and that isnt in our family budget if i want to keep the heat on this winter i can choose to resign or i can stick with it and fight this out
8095607 was the decision of a board made without dialog based on rumors and innuendo this was a disappointment for all involved this was a missed opportunity for a conversation and a missed opportunity to work together to identify problems and find solutions
8095608 i n light of the efforts the council had initiated on the downtown growth incentive zone the idea that we wanted to bring new local businesses to our town and not discourage them the savings didnt outweigh the costs that was a decision based on many hours of studying and understanding this issue
8095609 i am not sure that pas an islamist party is convinced that he can get 30 government mps to cross over

8095613 tyndall is unfortunately gone to switzerland so that i cannot get you his comments whether he might have picked holes in any detail or not i do dot know but i know his opinions sufficiently well to make sure in his agreement with the general argument in fact a favourite problem of his is given the molecular forces in a mutton chop deduce hamlet or faust therefrom he is confident that the physics of the future will solve this easily
8095614 all religious theories schemes and systems which embrace notions of cosmogony or which otherwise reach into the domain of science must in so far as they do this submit to the control of science and relinquish all thought of controlling it

8095616 to be ignorant of ones ignorance is the malady of the ignorant
8095617 since the early 1970s ddt has been banned in industrialised countries and the interdiction was gradually extended to malarious countries the bans occurred because of environmental concerns
8095618 global trends of decreasing numbers of sprayed houses started with changing strategy from the vectorcontrol approach to malaria control was progressively strengthened by whos malaria control strategies of 1969 1979 and 1992 these strategies were adopted even though published who documents and committee reports have consistently and accurately characterised ddt sprayed houses as the most cost effective and safe approach to malaria control
8095619 additionally assistance from industrialised countries was often specifically contingent on not using ddt
8095620 other mechanisms also have been used by environmental advocates to stop use of ddt for malaria control a recent example is the agreement of the north american commission for environmental cooperation cec that forced mexico to stop producing and using ddt for malaria control
8095621 on a landscape scale a sprayed house will only have a very small amount of ddt enclosed in the walls nevertheless environmentalists are still seeking a global ban arguing that if ddt is produced for use in improving public health it will also be used for agriculture and lead to global pollution of the environment
8095622 the replacement of ddt by organophosphate carbamate or pyrethroid insecticides is commonly proposed even though price efficacy duration of effectiveness and side effects eg unpleasant smell are major barriers to their use in poor countries high costs and downward trends in foreign assistance discourage many countries that cannot afford the switch to ddt alternatives
8095623 the west is hypocritically depriving developing countries of the right to use ddt
8095624 because of carson the agricultural use of ddt was banned but not the anti malarial use of ddt and it has continued to be used to this day
8095625 rachel carson is the greatest murderer of recent times solely responsible for millions of malaria deaths
8095626 realmente estoy preocupado y por tal motivo ma ana por hoy le pediremos explicaciones al rector aldo caballero en la reuni n de presupuesto de la universidad
8095627 la agrot cnica tiene un presupuesto interesante no se si es suficiente o no a nadie nos alcanza el dinero pero yo creo que se debe administrar mejor
8095628 es decir un 40 por ciento m s pero con cuatro carreras con la proyecci n de una m s cuidando un predio de 5 000 hect reas con bosques nativos mantenimiento de ocho laboratorios estamos pudiendo sobrellevar la situaci n que es cr tica
8095629 es que los alumnos deban volverse a sus casas por falta de recursos para darles de comer es por eso que por lo menos le preguntar al rector aldo caballero cual es su visi n sobre la situaci n
8095630 en la medida que existan recursos financieros la escuela agrot cnica los recibe durante el ejercicio de 2008 exclusivamente para funcionamiento se le giraron alrededor de 200 mil pesos

8095639 people in this profession can burn out quickly if they do not have the right support
8095640 the people who come into this profession have a genuine passion and a love for it so it is absolutely vital to bring our new staff on board
8095641 we have classes with 20 to 30 students and teaching to each one of them can be an intimidating task for a new teacher
8095642 its good for them to have someone they can rely on or turn to for guidance and support because this really is about leaving no child behind
8095643 because they work with people who are bringing fresh ideas and current resources to the table

8095645 antioxidants sit within this tiny trojan horse protecting it from attack from digestive juices in the stomach
8095646 once in the small intestine the nanoparticle gets sticky and bonds to the intestinal wall it then leaks its contents directly into the intestinal cells which allows them to be absorbed directly into the blood stream
8095647 we hope that by mastering this technique drugs and supplements also vulnerable to the digestive process can be better absorbed by the human body
8095648 for catechins the class of antioxidants under examination and among the most potent dietary antioxidants only between 0 1 and 1 1 per cent of the amount consumed makes it into our blood if we can improve that rate the benefits are enormous

8095662 everyone is hanging on for dear life at both papers
8095663 the cta is very happy to be able to provide free rides for those individuals who are disabled and least able to pay
8095664 that being said unfortunately there is nothing free about free rides as they have a cost to the cta
8095665 i would hate for the two free ride programs to be compared to one another
8095666 this was in the works long before the governor gave free rides to seniors unlike that program which pays no attention to income this ensures those who most deserve help can get it
8095667 they can score from anywhere on the park either through their pace or their power
8095668 they have a lot of good players and they back themselves
8095669 traditionally we are expected to at least be competitive against those teams and we are really looking forward to testing ourselves against the super 14 base sides
8095670 well know more after this weekend and more again in another month where we are at
8095671 the propositions for the subdivision of texas in bells plan were exactly the same as those reported as part of websters plan in the press
8095672 initially received some supportive comments but it would fail as the basis for compromise just as all other schemes focused on the subdivision of texas did
8095673 the great majority of northern legislators would not countenance a subdivision
8095674 we all knew this day would come sooner or later

8095679 we continue to invest in the network and still putting some in but we will take some out where they are gathering dust
8095680 its a gentle pruning exercise rather than large scale deforestation
8095681 arguably as the bigger more cost efficient stores move out the poor increasingly are likely to find themselves choosing between traveling farther to purchase nutritious competitively priced groceries or paying inflated prices for low quality processed foods at corner stores
8095682 stores pricing and location decisions in most instances are guided by competitive factors rather than any bias against the poor or their neighborhoods
8095683 one suggestion would be to explore the possibility of encouraging co operative stores which spreads the ownership among a relatively large group of stake holders within the poor community while at the same time increasing its operational economies of scale another possibility might be to consider joint ownership or management of franchises of selective stores in the poorest neighborhoods by the corporate owners of big grocery chains and poor residents

8095692 if woolworths appeal is unsuccessful again both companies are in the same position
8095693 we have previously put some strong arguments to the commission and the courts as to why any acquisition would be lawful i am comfortable that the supreme court will be in a position to properly consider the issues
8095694 we will await with interest the outcome of the woolworths appeal and as we have consistently said we would not rule anything in or anything out going forward

8095697 it is time for parents everywhere to take action now to get proactive and help protect their children from child predators according to the national center for missing and exploited children ncmec there are more than 100 000 registered sex offenders and child predators that are unaccounted for in the u s under megans law whats more alarming is the fact that if abducted by a stranger the statistics reflect that a child will likely be murdered if not found within the first three hours of being abducted if a child is not amber ready it may take up to four hours for a parent to confirm a child is missing and to collect essential identification information to supply police with what is necessary to launch a search there is no longer any reason that parents should give predators intent on harming our kids this head start when amber ready police can react instantaneously by transmitting an alert from a parents wireless phone thus improving the odds that their child will be found by authorities and safely returned home
8095698 with the amber ready ii enrollment platform parents do not need to wait until aasc hosts a child safety and enrollment event in their area by simply using their wireless phone or accessing our planned new web site parents and guardians can make their kids amber ready immediately moreover aasc can reach and empower millions of families in a fraction of the time it would have taken through our centers and special events
8095699 the 10 million parents for child safety imperative is a national movement designed by aasc to promote awareness of the amber ready free sponsorship program and to create a partnership between parents educators law enforcement and communities nationwide that will empower us all to play a role in protecting every child from the danger of predators if we prove successful more than ten million parents will be prepared to provide law enforcement with the information that could help lead to the safe and rapid recovery of their child in the event of an abduction moreover with each amber ready ii enrollment the amber alert safety foundation will make a donation to the ncmec for each subscribers state amber plan and a donation to the ctia to support the wireless amber alert program the goal of this imperative will be to donate 10 million to the ncmec and 10 million to the ctia
8095700 we vigorously applaud the ny giants organization for taking the safety and security of their junior fans so seriously

8095704 one day at her house in minneapolis as we sat around talking
8095705 the outcome will be sickness and death and homelessness and for those cut off from health coverage and help
8095706 shame on you barack obama enough with the speeches and the big rallies and then using tactics that are right out of karl roves playbook
8095707 senator obama holds up his original opposition to the war on the campaign trail but he didnt start working aggressively to end the war until he started running for president so when he had a chance to act on his speech he chose silence instead
8095708 last summer he basically threatened to bomb pakistan which i dont think was a particularly wise position to take
8095709 so you decide which makes more sense entrust our country to someone who is ready on day one or to put america in the hands of someone with little national or international experience who started running for president the day he arrived in the u s senate
8095710 well you know senator obama it is very difficult having a straight up debate with you because you never take responsibility for any vote and that has been a pattern
8095711 if we dont have universal health care we will be betraying the democratic partys principles sen obamas plan does not and cannot cover all americans
8095712 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8095713 three things in human life are important the first is to be kind the second is to be kind and the third is to be kind
8095714 the one thing i want to leave my children is an honorable name
8095715 it is hard to fail but it is worse never to have tried to succeed
8095716 given to him by oink37 and bestows it upon cyress8
8095717 barack obama and john mccain have never had executive decision making experience ever
8095718 were not electing a rock star its not a vote to see whos the most charismatic
8095719 barack obama and joe biden are committed to producing enough homegrown fuel to replace every drop of the oil we import from the middle east and venezuela in just 10 years an obama administration will invest 4 billion to keep america in the car making business and give you a tax cut so you can buy a fuel efficient car or truck
8095720 its time for a president who will bring our jobs back and bring our troops home for the change we need its time for barack obama
8095721 what we need is someone who can step right in and do something right away clinton has an amazing ability to adjust
8095722 she and i are very good friends and i think she will be the best president when i sign up to support a candidate its to the end
8095723 you know it was once said of the first george bush that he was born on third base and thought hed hit a triple
8095724 well with the 22 million new jobs and the budget surplus bill clinton left behind george w bush came into office on third base and then he stole second
8095725 and john mccain cheered him every step of the way
8095726 oh uh there wont be any money but when you die on your deathbed you will receive total consciousness
8095727 three things in human life are important the first is to be kind the second is to be kind and the third is to be kind
8095728 john mccain calls himself a maverick but he votes with george bush 90 percent of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
8095729 and guess who voted with president bush 90 percent of the time sen john mccain
8095730 now the oil companies are placing their bets on john mccain bankrolling his campaign and gambling with our future
8095731 explains why he wants to give another 4 billion tax break to oil companies
8095732 at a time when america should be working harder than ever to develop new clean sources john mccain wants more of the same and has taken more than a million dollars in campaign donations from the oil and gas industry now he wants to give the oil companies another 4 billion in tax breaks four billion in tax breaks for big oil

8095735 i know were at the democratic convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or a d next to it
8095736 because this election isnt about liberal versus conservative its not about left versus right its about the future versus the past
8095737 in george bush and john mccains america far too many
8095738 a plan that would explode the deficit that will be passed on to our kids no real plan to invest in our infrastructure and his plan would continue spending 10 billion a month in iraq
8095739 i dont know about you but thats not just right thats four more years that we cant just afford
8095740 old partisanship gives way to new ideas and hope replaces fear
8095741 and a whole lot of good folks who didnt see themselves as either democrats or republicans but as virginians
8095742 right now at this critical moment in our history we have one shot to get it right
8095743 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground we need leaders who will appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8095744 the race for the future is on and it wont be won if only some americans are in the running
8095745 it wont be won with yesterdays ideas and yesterdays divisions
8095746 and it wont be won with a president who is stuck in the past
8095747 we need a president who understands the world today the future we seek and the change we need we need barack obama

8095757 sin embargo tampoco los prefectos quieren debatir eso y solo quieren prolongar postergar y no hacer aprobar la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado boliviano
8095758 yo le explique al canciller que fui a santa cruz por varias razones a entregar ayuda estuve en la inauguraci n de las olimpiadas especiales con el prefecto y aprovech la oportunidad de esta visita tambi n para reunirme en p blico con el prefecto costas nada m s que eso que es parte de mi labor diplom tica

8095765 some theologians to speculate that specifically human life capable of receiving an immortal soul may not exist until a few weeks into pregnancy while in canon law these theories led to a distinction in penalties between very early and later abortions the churchs moral teaching never justified or permitted abortion at any stage of development
8095766 agrees with the church that we should reduce the number of abortions

8095769 hay algunas acciones en momentos de tensi n que pueden provocar malos entendidos
8095770 mientras thomas shannon dice que lo respetan al presidente morales que respetan la democracia boliviana y al gobierno su embajador se re ne con un prefecto quien insulta con quien no quiere acatar las leyes
8095771 no ayudan a construir esas relaciones positivas que ambos gobiernos pretenden
8095772 esperamos que el embajador en adelante tenga m s cuidado en realizar acciones que puedan perjudicar la construcci n positiva de nuestras relaciones
8095773 el puede reunirse pero que trate de evitar esos encuentros en estos momentos de tensi n que pueden deteriorar las relaciones y l goldberg est muy consciente de eso y va tratar de evitar estos encuentros
8095774 we are absolutely delighted they publish authors such as penny vincenzi wendy holden and martina cole
8095775 they are part of the massive hodder group so it was great news for us that they were interested in our idea and wanted to publish a book called moan about men
8095776 the pitch was great it proposed that the book was written by author juliana foster using the moanaboutmen website as a basis for a words led rant about the things that women find universally irritating about men
8095777 obviously this is a very exciting time for us we have been to london and met the publisher and author and we have seen a couple of chapters of the work
8095778 most of the moaning is humourous and light hearted but the forum is also a place where women are coming together for a girlie chat and making new friends
8095779 the phrase the industry should rally around is serious games to bring together the numerous disciplines however forrester recommends identifying individual games with the underlying goal of the game for example calling volvo car uks game an immersive learning simulation we dont see this being an issue in a few years as the old guard in the workforce is replaced by younger colleagues as this happens doubts about calling a game a game will subside future business leaders are already thinking in terms of games as ibms bpm video game coming out of a competition between business students at duke university and the university of north carolina at chapel hill
8095780 city employees should not be allowed to solicit from local residents and businesses
8095781 but it really does create a situation where conflicts of interest could occur
8095782 generally it is not a good idea to allow police to solicit from the people they serve
8095783 a lot of times people dont know that they can say no
8095784 we asked him to provide us with some specific figures but he never did that
8095785 i dont have an exact number but it certainly was thousands
8095786 that is a problem that had to be addressed it had to be corrected so that it passed the smell test
8095787 your interpretation is correct there are clearly some features and functionality that nintendo could add to the wii without changing the way the games are played as you say
8095788 analysts words misconstrued upgraded wii comments not meant to be next gen preemptive strike
8095789 that was supposed to be our house this was supposed to be my home city you were supposed to be my husband
8095790 no word on how it went i have no idea
8095791 hes going through the appeal process no clue what went on or when its going to be finished im sure it will be done in a timely fashion
8095792 originally started as a 20 project in 2004 and has since expanded to google labs toolbar firefox search box
8095793 after all the rumours we have finally and quite literally unwrapped australias first surface

8095795 after all the rumours we have finally and quite literally unwrapped australias first surface
8095796 youre asking an awful lot of high school guidance counselors because the parents arent there to help students
8095797 when language is a factor it becomes extra challenging to meet the high standards
8095798 we really want to be culturally responsive in our teaching
8095799 the juices are flowing just because the first game is coming
8095800 yeah i thought we had a really good pre season were excited about our execution
8095801 we came out and we got into training camp at the beginning it was the best the offence has started for us at camp
8095802 usually the defence is far and away ahead but having the guys that we had at certain positions we were able to kind of pick up where we left off and go from there and it was important to get that feeling of confidence
8095803 actually this might be the easiest week for a lot of guys
8095804 this is obviously an opportunity for all of us especially for the starters and the guys who are going to go into the season full steam ahead to kind of get our legs back get refreshed and then be ready to go next week
8095805 last year we came out of the gate pretty good in that first game
8095806 were a pretty veteran group experienced especially offensive i think well be ok
8095807 because our new campaign is this is our league were saying the traditions and fabric of this country are worth celebrating
8095808 this helps with the performance of our brand and exposure
8095809 i really didnt know about the 1950 mud bowl until this year
8095810 its an honour to learn more about the history of the game and be a part of it
8095811 he was not a blackberry kind of guy said his younger brother joshua goldman a 32 year old hybrid city bus engineer from san diego
8095812 man of la mancha his family said they remembered him at the camping trip he organized for his four brothers strumming a mandolin and singing as they paddled three weeks before his death down the potomac river this was near where he had been born and raised in potomac md goldmans father was nuclear physicist for the u s government from him benjamin got his chin dimple and his probing disciplined intellect his mother was a lover of philosophy henry james and the grand ole opry from her her son inherited his passionate love of music goldman met his wife when they were teenagers at a jewish summer camp they fell in love as counselors after a year in israel on a kibbutz he learned hebrew and wrote a song for his new love called dance lonni dance
8095813 ben had a gift for seeing things the way few of us could said paul mcnab vice president of marketing and corporate marketing organization for cisco
8095814 every problem was an opportunity every roadblock a chance to shine every discouragement a possibility to improve
8095815 for the next 2 hours we went whooping and hollering through the corridors of the pentagon fast i mean fast said his brother michael an allergist from maryland
8095816 youre not allowed to go roller blading in the pentagon
8095817 im sorry i didnt know you couldnt go roller blading here
8095818 we are facing extraordinary growth whether we like it or not and to accommodate that it is important that we have child care said councilman sam liccardo
8095819 we dont like the decision but we are willing to work with the community for a year at 45 beck said
8095820 i have come up with what i hope and think is as balanced an approach to this project as possible
8095821 i am sorry that mrs beck made a poor choice from the beginning without doing her homework
8095822 why does someone who doesnt live in the district get more consideration than the people who do
8095823 if the whole human race lay in one grave the epitaph on its headstone might well be it seemed a good idea at the time
8095824 look at the size of the pork chops on this one
8095825 it really depends on the fair and the location in the country
8095826 my father brought in a big steer to the fair that weighed 3 100 pounds
8095827 usually people are amazed and dont believe it until they actually see it
8095828 they cant really do the clipping part so i took advantage of them being in bed
8095829 not only are we beekeepers but we are also educators and provide bees that pollinate for farms
8095830 ive been asked how many times have you been stung quite a lot
8095831 we have so many students who are holding back academically
8095832 its a very rigorous challenging curriculum that focuses on intercultural respect
8095833 this is definitely a curriculum for extremely high end students with a tremendous work ethic
8095834 more than ever the sat reflects the face of education in this country
8095835 you only had the best of the best taking the test
8095836 ive never been a person that does things for political gain
8095837 if that was the fact i wouldnt have voted to fire jerry knerr and bill faber i made the motion because its time for this to stop
8095838 ive read the judges recommendation and i think we should go with that weve wasted a lot of money time and taxpayers dollars its time to let a third party who is disinterested decide the issue
8095839 would reflect the merger of local 113 into local 92 and to amend the certification to show local 92 instead of local 113 as the exclusive representative
8095840 its now almost two years since township employees william faber and jerry knerr were terminated if the state employment relations board serb were to simply order the employer to post a cease and desist notice and proceed with the grievance procedure that should have been completed two years ago there would be little if any motivation for this or any public employer to comply with their responsibilities under ohio revised code chapter 4117
8095841 no evidence exists to support the assertion that local 113 and local 92 were merged together per the national labor relations board nlrb or serb precedent the fact that a mere letter to the respondent township with no additional action does not magically transfer to local 92 the same bargaining relationship that the respondent had with local 113
8095842 the unprecedented demand for american eagle gold one ounce bullion coins necessitates our allocating these coins among the authorized purchasers on a weekly basis until we are able to meet demand
8095843 were probably going to lose somewhere in the neighborhood of 2 billion this year
8095844 if we dont act well lose 2 billion or more the following year
8095845 i believe very strongly that our rural communities are a whole lot more than a 5 digit or 9 digit zip code
8095846 and day by day attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes they received their food with glad and generous hearts
8095847 how i did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable and teaching you in public and from house to house
8095848 to whom not only i give thanks but all the churches of the gentiles give thanks as well greet also the church in their house
8095849 the churches of asia send you greetings aquilla and prisca together with the church in their house send you hearty greetings in the lord
8095850 and apphia our sister and archippus our fellow soldier and the church in your house

8095852 si me dicen que l mart nez es un fajador y un peleador fuerte eso me gusta porque yo soy un fajador tambi n
8095853 yo he peleado con grandes boxeadores como el ex campe n mundial antonio cerme o y lo noque adem s de otros grandes peleadores as que me siento preparado para cualquier rival

8095855 ya gan en una ocasi n y ahora vengo un poco m s r pido y a ganar por nocaut
8095856 youve got a public that on some level has a complex mix of views on this subject admiring of women admiring of traits that they associate with leadership but not yet admiring of women in top leadership roles
8095857 if women are not distinguished from men in their view of men and women in politics then there is no hope for change
8095858 we have to prepare for the world coming to the arctic
8095859 are the increasingly ice free shipping lanes that can cut shipping times by a third or more
8095860 a future battleground could be russians are conducting naval exercises in the arctic canada sent soldiers north in the spring more likely at least in the short term well see a lot of novel legal arguments and history aired out in trying to establish rightful claims the shipping lanes are a big deal not only because they shave off a lot of time compared with existing routes but also because the existing shipping lanes are about tapped out there are a handful of energy chokepoints that handle nearly all of the worlds oil shipments the fate of these chokepoints and the consequences of failure at any point could have huge impacts on the oil markets
8095861 no sharp line can be drawn between scientific technique and traditional arts and crafts the essential characteristic of scientific technique is the utilization of natural forces in ways not evident to the totally uninstructed
8095862 as we approach modern times the changes deliberately brought about in social structure become greater this is especially the case where revolutions are concerned the american revolution and the french revolution deliberately created certain societies with certain characteristics but in the main these characteristics were political and their effects in other directions formed no part of the primary intentions of the revolutionaries but scientific technique has so enormously increased the power of governments that it has now become possible to produce much more profound and intimate changes in social structure than any that were contemplated by jefferson or robespierre science first taught us to create machines it is now teaching us by mendelian breeding and experimental embryology to create new plants and animals there can be little doubt that similar methods will before long give us power within wide limits to create new human individuals differing in predetermined ways from the individuals produced by unaided nature and by means of psychological and economic technique it is becoming possible to create societies as artificial as the steam engine and as different from anything that would grow up of its own accord without deliberate intention on the part of human agents such artificial societies will of course until social science is much more perfected than it is at present have many unintended characteristics even if their creators succeed in giving them all the characteristics that were intended the unintended characteristics may easily prove more important than those that were foreseen and may cause the artificially constructed societies to break down in one way or another but i do not think it is open to doubt that the artificial creation of societies will continue and increase so long as scientific technique persists the pleasure in planned construction is one of the most powerful motives in men who combine intelligence with energy whatever can be constructed according to a plan such men will endeavour to construct so long as the technique for creating a new type of society exists there will be men seeking to employ this technique they are likely to suppose themselves actuated by some idealistic motive and it is possible that such motives may play a part in determining what sort of society they shall aim at creating but the desire to create is not itself idealistic since it is a form of the love of power and while the power to create exists there will be men desirous of using this power even if unaided nature would produce a better result than any that can be brought about by deliberate intention
8095863 there are in the world at the present time two powers which illustrate the possibility of artificial creation the two powers in question are japan and soviet russia
8095864 modern japan 1930 is almost exactly what it was intended to be by the men who made the revolution in 1867 this is one of the most remarkable political achievements in all history in spite of the fact that the purpose which inspired the innovators was simple and such as every japanese might be expected to sympathize with the purpose was in fact nothing more recondite than the preservation of national independence china had been found impotent to resist the western powers and japan appeared to be in like case certain japanese statesman perceived that the military and naval power of the western nations rested upon western education and western industrial technique they decided to introduce both with such modifications as japanese history and circumstances demanded but whereas industrialism had grown up in the west with very little assistance from the state and scientific knowledge had developed very far before the western governments undertook the task of universal education japan being pressed for time was obliged to impose education and science and industrialism by governmental pressure it was clearly impossible to effect so great a change in the mentality of the average citizen by mere appeals to reason and self interest the reformers therefore skilfully enlisted the divine person of the mikado and the divine authority of the shinto religion on the side of modern science the mikado had been for centuries obscure and unimportant but he had already been restored to power once before in the year a d 645 so that there was a precedent of respectable antiquity for what was being done the shinto religion unlike buddhism was indigenous to japan but had been for ages thrust into the background by the foreign religion imported from china and korea the reformers very wisely decided that in introducing christian military technique they would not attempt to introduce the theology with which it had hitherto been correlated but would have a nationalistic theology of their own shinto as now taught by the state in japan is a powerful weapon of nationalism its gods are japanese and its cosmogony teaches that japan was created sooner than other countries the mikado is descended from the sun goddess and is therefore superior to the mere earthly rulers of other states shinto as now taught is so different from the old indigenous beliefs that competent students have described it as a new religion as a result of this skilful combination of enlightened technique with unenlightened theology the japanese have succeeded not merely in repelling the western menace but in becoming one of the great powers and achieving the third place on the sea japan has shown extraordinary sagacity in the adaptation of science to political needs science as an intellectual force is sceptical and somewhat destructive of social coherence while as a technical force it has precisely the opposite qualities the technical developments due to science have increased the size and intensity of organizations and have more particularly greatly augmented the power of governments governments have therefore good reason to be friendly to science so long as it can be kept from dangerous and subversive speculations in the main the men of science have shown themselves amenable the state favours one set of superstitions in japan and another in the west but the scientists both in japan and of the west have with some exceptions been willing to acquiesce in governmental doctrines because most of them are citizens first and servants of truth only in the second place in spite of the extraordinary success of japanese policy there are certain unintended effects which are likely in time to cause serious difficulties the sudden change of habits and of conscious opinions has induced a certain nervous strain at any rate in the urban part of the population this may produce a tendency to hysteria in time of national stress indeed such a tendency was shown in the massacres of koreans that occurred after the earthquake of tokio what is more serious the position of japan demands the growth of both industrialism and armaments owing to the expense of the latter the industrial workers are poor they tend consequently to acquire a rebellious mentality and the circumstances of their work make it difficult for them to preserve that close family organization upon which japanese society is built if japan should become engaged in an unsuccessful war these stances might produce a revolution analogous to the russian revolution the present social structure in japan is likely therefore in time to become unstable but it may be that the same skill which has rendered possible the triumphant career of japan throughout the last seventy years will enable the japanese to adapt themselves to changing circumstances gradually without any violent upheaval the one thing that seems fairly certain is that whether gradually or by revolution the social structure in japan will have to be profoundly modified remarkable as it is therefore it is not a perfect example of scientific construction i do not mean by this that it could have been bettered at the time but only that it is not in all respects a model for the future
8095865 the attempt at scientific construction which is being made by the soviet government is more ambitious than that which was carried through by the japanese innovators in 1867 it aims at a much greater change in social institutions and at the creation of a society far more different from anything previously known than is that of japan the experiment is still in progress and only a rash man would venture to predict whether it will succeed or fail the attitude both of friends and enemies towards it has been singularly unscientific for my part i am not anxious to appraise the good or evil in the soviet system but merely to point out those elements of deliberate planning which make it so far the most complete example of a scientific society in the first place all the major factors of production and distribution are controlled by the state in the second place all education is designed to stimulate activity in support of the official experiment in the third place the state does what it can to substitute its religion for the various traditional beliefs which have existed within the territory of the u s s r in the forth place literature and the press are controlled by the government and are such as are thought likely to help it in its constructive purposes in the fifth place the family in so far as it represents a loyalty which competes with loyalty to the state is being gradually weakened in the sixth place the five year plan is bending the whole constructive energies of the nation to the realization of a certain economic balance and productive efficiency by means of which it is hoped that a sufficient degree of material comfort will be secured for everyone in every other society of the world there is enormously less central direction than under the soviet government it is true that during the war the energies of the nations were to a considerable extent centrally organized but everyone knew that this was temporary and even at its height the organization was not so all pervasive as it is in russia the five year plan as its name implies is supposed to be temporary and to belong to a time of stress not wholly unlike that of the great war but it is to be expected that if it succeeds other plans will take its place since the central organization of the vast nations activities is too attractive to the organizers to be abandoned readily the russian experiment may succeed or may fail but even if it fails it will be followed by others which will share its most interesting characteristic namely the unitary direction of a whole nations activities this was impossible in earlier days since it depends upon the technique of propaganda i e upon universal education newspapers the cinema and the wireless the state had already been strengthened by railways and the telegraph which made possible the rapid transmission of news and concentration of troops in addition to modern methods of propaganda modern methods of warfare have strengthened the state as against discontented elements aeroplanes and poison gasses have made revolt difficult unless it obtains the support of aeronauts and chemists any prudent government will favour these two classes and take pains to secure their loyalty as the example of russia has shown it is now possible for men of energy and intelligence if they once become possessed of the governmental machine to retain power even though at first they may have to face the opposition of the majority of the population we must therefore increasingly expect to see government falling into the hands of oligarchies not of birth but of opinion in countries long accustomed to democracy the empire of these oligarchies may be concealed behind democratic forms as was that of augustus in rome but elsewhere their rule will be undisguised if there is to be scientific experimentation in the construction of new kinds of societies the rule of an oligarchy of opinion is essential it may be expected that there will be conflicts between different oligarchies but that ultimately some one oligarchy will acquire world dominion and will produce a world wide organization as complete and elaborate as that now existing in the u s s r
8095866 the financial storm that reached gale force some weeks before our last meeting
8095867 if not reversed these developments together with a pace of growth that is likely to fall short of potential for a time should lead inflation to moderate later this year and next
8095868 the scale of help is such that i dont think it can come from the private sector
8095869 were not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war of course we dont need that everything depends on the stance of our partners and the world community and our partners in the west
8095870 if they want to preserve good relations with russia they will understand the reason for taking such a decision and the situation will be calm
8095871 after the georgian leadership lost their marbles as they say all the problems got worse and a military conflict erupted
8095872 and i believe we should handle other existing conflicts in this context
8095873 we have agreed to meet and discuss the transdniestria settlement
8095874 i think there is a good reason to do this today i see good prospects of reaching a settlement
8095875 russia is ready to continue its efforts towards finally solving the transdniestrian crisis
8095876 thank god during all these years we had enough brains and reserve not to allow a similar deterioration of situation
8095877 frozen conflicts are a real volcano which can blow up anytime
8095878 that is why taking into account what had happened elsewhere it would be useful if we exercised again such wisdom not to allow such things to repeat in our country
8095879 hes nervous because hes the kind of guy that wants everyone to be pleased with his performance starting with himself hes a perfectionist
8095880 but i think when it comes down to the concepts that our people have asked him to understand the true xs and os that people have asked him to understand i think hes done an excellent job
8095881 we always have our team meetings just the players no coaches win or lose we bring everything to the table iron out any problems were having whether its on the field personal or whatever
8095882 we realize our situation right now but even if we had a 4 0 preseason what would it matter if we went out and lost the first game
8095883 what weve worked through this preseason will help us in the long run i think
8095884 i mean well be getting guys back we had 15 guys who didnt even travel with us last week fifteen key guys
8095885 there were plays we could have corrected that we gave them kevin smiths 35 yard cutback was one
8095886 one thing we learned is people cant line up and pound us any more
8095887 any time anything goes into the middle the big guys are clogging and making the ball bounce
8095888 when we are able to do things like we did offensively at garaway we hope to do that each week but its not realistic
8095889 hopefully we can get better by no means did we play the perfect game we were able to put points on the board but we still made mistakes
8095890 it didnt hurt us on friday but im sure it could hurt us on another friday
8095891 it was the first game thats just how it went last week we were able to match them up we scored 42 points and at no time were we safe in the game because they moved the ball down inside our 20 late we were able to stop them there and run the clock out
8095892 we didnt want to get into a shootout because we knew how dangerous they were we wanted to keep the ball out of their hands as much as possible but still two touchdowns were for over 60 yards and the other two were set up by 50 yard plus plays
8095893 keyes and beun were the pillar of last weeks game
8095894 garaway didnt run the ball but they ran 77 plays any defense that runs 77 plays in the course of a game should have people with 25 tackles they just happened to be in those spots
8095895 probably they run the quarterback a little bit more a lot of spread formations theyll motion sometimes they like to run counter inside zone and then theyll zone read off their quarterback a little bit they try the jet sweep and sweep with the motion they can do it but thats not really our concern
8095896 we can just look back at the film from last year and see from our mistakes we can just see from their films the comparisons and just look back and see how we can fix our mistakes
8095897 theyre going to run more quarterback counters and things like that there might be situations where he scrambles but not like the buchtel quarterback
8095898 jordans quarterback is not as much of a scrambler as buchtels quarterback it just helps how buchtels quarterback can affect the second game of the season
8095899 were hoping that throws teams a little off balance and keeps 10 guys out of the box on the run
8095900 we can do some different things with it teams always have stacked the line somewhat against us but we still have done pretty well running the ball but we dont just have to run the spread to throw the ball we can do it out of the wing t as well
8095901 i thought our kids ran great routes and we took advantage of what they gave us
8095902 we completed most of our passes but that was only for one half because we didnt really have the need to throw the ball in the second half
8095903 sometimes people might think of perry as being one dimensional but this year hyde gives them that threat that not only can they run the football extremely well but they can also put it in the air if they have to
8095904 they threw it very effectively when they wanted to last week and that just gives you another dimension that you have to defend
8095905 adam has done a great job and hes gotten better and better during the offseason
8095906 he needs that playing time to continue to improve and we want to rest johnny on offense because he also plays defense for us
8095907 anytime you can run the ball well like we were able to do that certainly can help open up the passing game
8095908 when youre running the ball then those defensive backs tend to creep up a little bit
8095909 i think anybody that was up to speed on the dynamics of the trade that went through i mean i didnt really have a whole heap of say with what went on so if people sort of bear that in mind i think theyll go easy on me
8095910 they wouldnt want to be sitting next to my mum if they boo though because they could end up with a lap of chips or something
8095911 eighty percent has been selected as the threshold for the trusts shareholding to provide vector with additional flexibility to undertake additional share buybacks in the future without the need for further waivers
8095912 it is time for parents everywhere to take action now to get proactive and help protect their children from child predators according to the national center for missing and exploited children ncmec there are more than 100 000 registered sex offenders and child predators that are unaccounted for in the u s under megans law whats more alarming is the fact that if abducted by a stranger the statistics reflect that a child will likely be murdered if not found within the first three hours of being abducted if a child is not amber ready it may take up to four hours for a parent to confirm a child is missing and to collect essential identification information to supply police with what is necessary to launch a search there is no longer any reason that parents should give predators intent on harming our kids this head start when amber ready police can react instantaneously by transmitting an alert from a parents wireless phone thus improving the odds that their child will be found by authorities and safely returned home
8095913 with the amber ready ii enrollment platform parents do not need to wait until aasc hosts a child safety and enrollment event in their area by simply using their wireless phone or accessing our planned new web site parents and guardians can make their kids amber ready immediately moreover aasc can reach and empower millions of families in a fraction of the time it would have taken through our centers and special events
8095914 the 10 million parents for child safety imperative is a national movement designed by aasc to promote awareness of the amber ready free sponsorship program and to create a partnership between parents educators law enforcement and communities nationwide that will empower us all to play a role in protecting every child from the danger of predators if we prove successful more than ten million parents will be prepared to provide law enforcement with the information that could help lead to the safe and rapid recovery of their child in the event of an abduction moreover with each amber ready ii enrollment the amber alert safety foundation will make a donation to the ncmec for each subscribers state amber plan and a donation to the ctia to support the wireless amber alert program the goal of this imperative will be to donate 10 million to the ncmec and 10 million to the ctia
8095915 we vigorously applaud the ny giants organization for taking the safety and security of their junior fans so seriously
8095916 monthly data for july show that the broad money growth has almost collapsed
8095917 its obviously worrying people either cant borrow or dont want to borrow even if they can
8095918 there are always short term blips but over the long run m3 has repeatedly shown itself good leading indicator
8095919 i dont think you can control all the world from one centre
8095920 there are big nations there are huge populations there is unbelievable economic development in some parts of the world so what we have to do is instead of unilateral actions act all together make common decisions and have consultations with the world a new world order if i can say it should emerge
8095921 such a deal by turkey with iran would send the wrong message at a time when the iranian regime has repeatedly failed to comply with its un security council and iaea obligations
8095922 i dont want to think about that everybody should take a lesson from what happened in iraq
8095923 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground we need leaders who will appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8095924 an energy policy that basically says lets borrow money from china to buy oil from countries that dont like us
8095925 all of them are more severe more immediate and more threatening because of the misguided policies and outdated thinking of this administration
8095926 hes starting to lose less blood which hopefully means the blood is clotting
8095927 if this continues on in the next couple of days then thats a very good thing and he may not have to have surgery to move part of his intestine
8095928 from what i can gather he saw a beautiful rock formation and it was all colours and really something special
8095929 it was in a bit of a ravine and he went to have a little look a bit closer and hes gone off the path a bit
8095930 then these horrible lizards almost komodo dragon size came out of nowhere and started chasing him and he had nowhere to go but over the cliff so he went over the edge to escape them and of course lost his footing so he tumbled down and down and down and he said he thought he landed in a creek
8095931 we had a little moment of touching hands to fingers
8095932 why should i keep all these old non sharp crayons
8095933 its part of the way the world works these days
8095934 governments are buying money off people whove dammed rivers which are public amenity
8095935 if it has to be that way let it be that way because we have to find that water to go right down the river and allow the environment and the primary human requirements to be met
8095936 i mean were talking about areas where the people are already doing it tough were talking about areas where there are strong indigenous populations
8095937 if you are going to buy something thats major in an area you must replace it with a substantial form of economic enterprise to take its place or you must buy out the rest of the houses
8095938 there is an industry responsibility to know who their suppliers are and to exercise some diligence
8095939 part of the original deal with les was that the council owned the apartment and rented it to him and a couple of things came up that changed the situation
8095940 a board member raised the question as to whether it would be proper for the council to continue to own the property given the fact that he had not been president for five years
8095941 i said look i dont want any questions to be raised about this why dont i just buy the apartment
8095942 its not a large apartment has kind of a small dinning room and a small living room and i dont know whether there are two bedrooms or three but theyre rather small what i really like is that they like it
8095943 the apartment itself is not large my wife did not want a large apartment and neither did i i basically wanted a terrace
8095944 it should be noted that this is a four night infomercial
8095945 were seeing people who are still working but who dont make enough the cost of living has outpaced income
8095946 we serve the largest population of working poor in the state
8095947 we have people working 60 and 70 hours a week who cant feed their families if we can keep families stable it strengthens the community
8095948 were seeing people who have lived here in bloomington for over 20 years in the same house but got caught in illness or job loss or they took out a second mortgage and theyre losing their house
8095949 people are coming to us and saying theyre going to be out of their house in less than a week they waited because they thought for sure theyd get that job or be able to fix the situation
8095950 two years ago we could pay a utility bill for 250
8095951 we are here to give families the tools to be strong the parents choose the gifts and the kids see the parents giving the gifts
8095952 the lutheran communion of faith is linked by name and heritage to the memory of martin luther teacher and reformer honoring his name in our own we recall his bold stand for truth his earthy and sublime words of wisdom and above all his witness to gods saving word luther proclaimed a gospel for people as we really are bidding us to trust a grace sufficient to reach our deepest shames and address the most tragic truths in the spirit of that truth telling we who bear his name and heritage must with pain acknowledge also luthers anti judaic diatribes and the violent recommendations of his later writings against the jews as did many of luthers own companions in the sixteenth century we reject this violent invective and yet more do we express our deep and abiding sorrow over its tragic effects on subsequent generations in concert with the lutheran world federation we particularly deplore the appropriation of luthers words by modern anti semites for the teaching of hatred toward judaism or toward the jewish people in our day
8095953 it is quite sad to see the typical vomiting of mindless anti semitism amp anti christinism in a pathetic attempted defense of darwinism evolutionism and other false science
8095954 martin luther i would say we see that his body of death includes a hatred for the jews that goes beyond what could be explained by the times in which he lived
8095955 we were just following the directives written by martin luther
8095956 besides he wrote a mighty fortress in german and somehow it rhymes in english a true miracle
8095957 dont call me christian because im really a disciple or follower of jesus the messiah

8095959 hes going to contribute in one way or another im not sure what it will be yet
8095960 finding ways to remember certain defenses and taking ones that i know from the past and finding ways to match them
8095961 there are several calls here that were something else somewhere else those were key words for me in the past so now ive got to erase them from my mind ive pretty much got it down the more you do it the more it becomes second nature to you
8095962 if you love san fran football and the man who makes the amazing hits every sunday
8095963 then join the official tko fan club and be a part of takeo spikes official team
8095964 hes a tough hard nosed football player everything a team could want in its locker room
8095965 hes consistent not up one game and down the next he studies the game he watches a lot of film i think hed be a good coach someday
8095966 we have a lot of talent especially up front some guys who probably wont get recognition on a larger scale like aubrayo franklin and ray mcdonald those guys come off the ball and they play hard theres so much potential on this team
8095967 everybody talks to each other and says dont tip off your stance here or we expect you to make that play its constructive criticism
8095968 one of the best technicians as a young linebacker that ive seen hes never out of position to make a play some guys may be all over the place where they take false steps hes not going to give you the false steps he understands what he has to do with his steps before the ball is even snapped that has to do with formation recognition
8095969 warner get a real job no ones going to want a phone in the car
8095970 i like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past
8095971 i think they ought to do whatever she wants them to do
8095972 hillary completely understands that our fates are all tied together
8095973 what is good for the country and what is good for barack is good for her i think she knows that
8095974 i went down with her to new mexico with gov bill richardson on the 17th
8095975 the obama campaign asked her to do an event in espanola a predominantly spanish speaking area which she carried
8095976 i think they made the right decision when it comes to home runs foul or fair
8095977 the new dimensions and the way stadiums are built it makes it very tough on the umpires the good part is they are not taking the human element away i like it the human element has been around for 100 years and you just cant take it away maybe in 100 years you may have a machine calling balls and strikes but i dont want to see that
8095978 i think if it just stands like this it is good
8095979 its tough to overturn safe and out then youll get into ball and strike then all of a sudden people have to pack more than a lunch to get here to the ballpark
8095980 theyre not out there trying to stick it to any particular team their job depends on them getting the calls right so i think the chiefs will be very fair and reasonable in deciding to use it if they get together and cant figure out whether it was a home run or not definitively thats when you go to the replay
8095981 you make the right decision and someone is going to get mad its going to help baseball and the umpires and obviously they are going to make the right decision we dont have to watch tv for two hours and talk about the same thing
8095982 i shouldnt say its not going to work put it this way this could turn into a little bit of fiasco
8095983 all we get all spring is speed up the games i dont know how many directives ive had on speed up the game this is certainly not going to speed up the game is it if it takes too long this isnt like football ill tell you what itll probably be used as a ploy by some managers just to freeze the pitcher for five or six minutes to cool him off if hes going really well baseballs got to look at this thing carefully whatever they do they really do
8095984 now that the ballparks are made real fan friendly there always is the chance of fan interference you are always going to have fans leaning over i think it could help
8095985 the human element is what makes baseball the game it is and i definitely dont ever want the game to go to instant replay for close plays or anything like that or end up having the strike zone called by computer
8095986 i think the human element is important for baseball so as long as and i know this was an important part of the players union agreeing to it we keep it limited only to home runs so were not opening a pandoras box
8095987 any time the umps convene and talk about it why not be sure and get it right
8095988 for anything other than home runs though i think itd be tough unless they had another ump up in the booth other calls thats the human element part of the game and i think they should just leave that alone
8095989 i find it very strange that they would pick with 30 games to go in the season that they would start it now
8095990 i find that very peculiar no 1 if they wanted it so bad what took them so long to get it going and why wait until this particular point in time i think they fudged on it because they originally said they were going to do it in the arizona fall league
8095991 how many times has a team gone or not gone to the playoffs because of a one game difference in the record
8095992 its important to get those right because that is something that is fixable through replay
8095993 the planes pilot has indicated that the hijackers who number 10 or maybe more have said they belong to the sudanese liberation army of abdel wahid mohammed nur
8095994 the hijackers claim to have coordinated with him nur to join him in paris
8095995 the hijackers refuse to free any passengers or even open the doors which have remained closed since the plane landed
8095996 this is the result of what the government is doing in the camps of displaced people in nyala
8095997 im not sure if its connected to kalma but its related to that the government kills and the international community does not intervene what can the darfurian people do
8095998 its bothered me but i know theyre looking out for me and my best interests
8095999 i feel like i need the reps and the drills to make myself as good as possible so i always try to get in as much as possible
8096000 if i had my choice id still be playing gunner too anything theyll let me do im going to do it
8096001 obviously he was very disappointed during the first meeting i had with him but there is no other person who is more dedicated to the teams success
8096002 even though hes not out there in the huddle hes coaching guys
8096003 its just really impressive to see a guy refusing to go into the tank and feeling sorry for himself
8096004 probably hang out with a lot of rabble like the kind i find at my game tables
8096005 come move this transmission so i can take a bath
8096006 ok but i should warn you that there is a statue of a naked man in there wearing only a fig leaf
8096007 well in that case ill just look the other way
8096008 sir i dont understand why did they applaud for me just because i went to the restroom
8096009 every time someone lifts the fig leaf on that statue the lights go out now how about that drink
8096010 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
8096011 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride

8096014 hes an eclectic person and kind of reminds me of a japanese version of johnny depp
8096015 come move this transmission so i can take a bath

8096017 well in that case ill just look the other way

8096023 if i ever hear ian healy or someone say sledging has been going on forever im going to refer him to the video of the invincibles there wasnt a word out of place for the whole tour
8096024 if bradman could come back today and see whats happening in the game of cricket i think hed be terribly disappointed
8096025 when i heard about ricky ponting delivering the bradman oration i thought to myself dear oh dear oh well thats the way they do things these days
8096026 i heard ponting being interviewed on the wireless one day it was after the india test at the sydney cricket ground where they disgraced themselves and all that baloney and i heard him say no im not going to tell my players what they can say
8096027 i thought god strike me that would be the equivalent of field marshal montgomery calling his colonels together on the night before the battle of el alamein well boys weve got rommel tomorrow at el alamein do it your way and ill see you at the finish
8096028 people have been a little bit askance about bradman they talk of him being unapproachable and so forth it wasnt the case
8096029 im certain i never queried him on it but he wouldnt say to a player later on when he was a selector look billy i think youre not travelling well it might be because of so and so that wasnt his go
8096030 but all you had to do was say can you help me hed bend over backwards then
8096031 the discussions last week were robust and constructive and we look forward to continuing this dialogue around a revised draft exemption text at next months meeting
8096032 the key function of the nsg is to formulate guidelines for managing exports of nuclear material equipment and technology to ensure that this trade does not contribute to nuclear weapons proliferation
8096033 while new zealand remains a strong advocate of the nuclear non proliferation treaty npt and the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty ctbt and would welcome indias accession to these treaties we have not included these elements in our package of proposals
8096034 while noting concerns and the need for consistency in pursuing the objective of non proliferation
8096035 a large number of countries big and small expressed views similar to new zealands that there needed to be compatibility between the us india agreement and the goals of the nsg and indicated a willingness to engage positively to achieve that outcome
8096036 the nsg exemption should be clean and there should be no additional condition
8096037 they may want to push but india cant be pushed civil nuclear cooperation is important but that doesnt mean at any cost
8096038 should we allow ourselves to be pushed are we not indians are you not proud of yourself and what you are doing
8096039 let me be clear weve conducted an intensive investigation chased down numerous leads and carefully reviewed the evidence to date
8096040 it is a very serious federal crime to threaten a presidential candidate in this case however there is insufficient evidence at this time to indicate a true threat plot or conspiracy against senator obama
8096041 reported threats hateful and bigoted though they were involved a group of meth heads methamphetamine abusers all of whom were impaired at the time and they cannot independently be corroborated
8096042 the evidence involving alleged threats does not warrant federal charges but the investigation is ongoing and we are keeping an open mind
8096043 what matters at this moment from a legal point of view the law recognises a difference between a true threat one that can be carried out and the racist rantings of drug users
8096044 he dont belong in political office blacks dont belong in political office he ought to be shot
8096045 we gave them equal opportunities and jake i wouldnt have guessed when we signed wade ended up beating him out
8096046 he came out and took the job he earned it he didnt get it by default
8096047 they didnt know they could count on me to come play
8096048 that didnt surprise me i knew after getting hurt i couldnt come in and mess around this was kind of make or break
8096049 before jake got hurt he was playing well but he wasnt the same jake that we see right now hes much stronger quicker
8096050 once my body felt good that made my mind feel good
8096051 being in the same system two years in a row is huge being able to try to fine tune something rather than try learning which way to go that makes a huge difference too
8096052 he was very close to returning but the great part about michael is that he takes his time to think about things and he is very thorough
8096053 you can get excited about coming back and running through the tunnel one more time
8096054 in the end he felt he could not get back to where he was
8096055 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8096056 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8096057 its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize
8096058 we know the parameters of the contract and the giants would have been generous
8096059 we knew it was a long shot but we owed it to ourselves to exhaust the possibility
8096060 we appreciate michael even considering ending his retirement he has a new career in front of him and we wish him nothing but the best as we all said when he announced his retirement michael was and is a great giant
8096061 there is a reason he went in the first round obviously
8096062 the guy he is playing behind strahan and osi and then we moved him to linebacker so obviously he is one of our top players on the team and he is going to show that he is a top defensive end in the league
8096063 we know we are a confident team and we are a playoff capable team and we have to go out and perform like it
8096064 the reason we took the underdog role last year was because everybody said it and we just went with it were not thinking like that this year we do have a chip on our shoulders and it grows more and more when somebody gives us something to feed off of
8096065 the only reason he will come back is if he wants to play
8096066 if we can get him 15 20 snaps in friday nights exhibition finale against san diego that would be good
8096067 although theyve been banged up theyve done a better job
8096068 he had only been a wide receiver two weeks ago
8096069 were going to look at some things in certain personnel to utilize him because he catches the ball so well and he is a bigger tailback but dont mistake that we claimed a fullback well look for another fullback to compete with this guy or depending on how this guy does this week the final waiver cut michael bush isnt here to be a fullback michael bush has a chance to be a spectacular tailback in this league and thats what hes here to play
8096070 in anaheim i had bruises from balls everywhere on my shoulder
8096071 but i never got them in the tips this has been the worst year i dont know if im doing something wrong
8096072 it can happen thats very true those are so tough on you having all these kids who are nasty sometimes the hitters are just defending themselves and get the tips
8096073 ive got to do it my season is just starting
8096074 ive got to get down there and get some innings under my belt to show these guys im healthy enough to throw
8096075 oh you pesky liberals and your talk talk talk about how horrible everyone else is
8096076 im so tired of having all those blacks just living off of welfare when my husband and i are taxed to pay for their babies and free cheese
8096077 if you vote for kerry you are voting for terrorism
8096078 do you really think id let a nigger run our family business
8096079 i think its picked up in the last couple years were seeing more people come out people are finding it more important to buy local and eat fresh
8096080 we get cold in the winter the nighttime temperatures drop into the 20s sometimes lower its the right climate for pears
8096081 years ago people used to come and pick large volumes for canning
8096082 im talking specifically about starters who consistently pitch six or seven innings
8096083 it just makes sense to have your best pitchers the ones youre paying the most money working those pressure innings
8096084 mentally youre training pitchers to look over their shoulder for the next guy to bail them out and then you have the 12th or 13th best pitcher on your team coming in for important outs that doesnt make sense
8096085 im not even sure i could pitch today id probably want to be a reliever as a starter you have no chance of controlling your destiny you can have a great game and not be able to finish it i trust me more than i trust a reliever
8096086 we were on a performance count not a pitch count
8096087 dont let them take you out win or lose this is great
8096088 pitchers of the generations up to marichals had a belief that this game is mine the idea of doing permanent harm to a pitchers arm didnt come into anyones mind
8096089 i think its proving over time that they arent really saving anybody guys are getting hurt just as much today as they were before if not more so this whole theory about saving their arms i aint buying it i think kids have to throw more and the more they throw the stronger theyll get in time i think it will go back to what it was for 100 years of baseball
8096090 what organization is going to have the guts to go down to the lower minors and have a four man rotation and forget about counting pitches and let them figure out how to pitch i think a lot of them want to its a combination of agents the money in the game today and fear
8096091 i kind of eyeball the clientele each day and put the birds on the spits accordingly
8096092 i place my finished birds up here and away from the main heat where theyre not cooking anymore but just a bit hot

8096094 the ageing crisis in australia is a far greater crisis than climate change
8096095 if action isnt taken now to plan for the financial crisis thats going to occur by the year 2030 the ageing population of australia will bankrupt the federal budget
8096096 by that time there will be more voters in australia over the age of 50 than under the age of 50 and that situation will worsen through the rest of the century
8096097 we believe that can be turned into an advantage if governments plan for it now
8096098 if they create the right conditions for pensioners in areas such as superannuation health and housing
8096099 the derby has been an iconic event for the past 32 years although a somewhat safer one now because you can no longer throw eggs
8096100 im far more attracted to go in the derby knowing im not going to have eggs landing on me just soft things
8096101 it will be interesting to see if our success in the water in beijing has inspired this years derby veterans to new levels of healthy competition

8096106 we have seen what the chinese have done here and im sure we will better that without a doubt
8096107 i was lucky enough to be back in london last week and had a lot of spare time in the hotel so i was watching the olympics all day it was great to see the cycling was so impressive and it was great for chris hoy to have achieved what he did

8096111 the mdc views this continued harassment and arrest of mdc legislators by the state security agents as a direct affront to the will of the people of zimbabwe
8096112 the capture of the speakers chair by the mdc levelled the ground effectively achieving a power sharing structure in the legislature outside the negotiations
8096113 this represents a shift of some power away from zanu pf and this should provide some considerable leverage for the mdc when talks resume
8096114 everyone wants to live at the expense of the state they forget that the state lives at the expense of everyone
8096115 were going to look at some things in some certain personnels to utilize him because he catches the ball so well and he is a bigger tailback but dont mistake that

8096348 they did not want lacers to be put into the position where questions might arise about the fairness of lacers decision making process
8096349 i dont have any feelings on it at all its going to play itself out
8096350 take a position that would be unfavorable to lacers interests
8096351 i realize that this may be a difficult e mail to read and it was difficult to write but please be assured that i come to this from the perspective of attempting to have all parties best interests in mind
8096352 mereka bertiga akan kami mutasikan soal tempat tugas akan ditentukan kemudian
8096353 kata anak anak buah saya mereka pertimbangannya kemanusiaan karena jhon kei mengeluh ruang tahanan panas
8096354 we had an agreement to have a somewhat open relationship and actually being involved in a game online was a very safe way to do that
8096355 what i can say is that right now in this present moment she is disease free
8096356 he goes no no no it cant be cancer he thought it was pneumonia or something
8096357 they sit me in this cold little waiting room and he the doctor comes back in and says they found a mass
8096358 we realised later we missed the chance of course we are angry
8096359 we are decent and treat them well so we left we are not paparazzi
8096360 she was very angry by the sound of her voice when she asked the danish media to leave
8096361 i got the impression she did not want to be hassled
8096362 they got to see lots of things and it was good they were able to have some quiet time
8096363 it wont be won with yesterdays ideas and yesterdays divisions and it wont be won with a president who is stuck in the past
8096364 are we going to declare our energy independence and change the world whos going to lead us there as the next president of the united states now lets go win this election
8096365 the normal political thing to do in terms of the best decision to make to win wouldve been to pick hillary clinton
8096366 it is a no brainer she got 18 million votes joe got 9 000 votes
8096367 hes a charming guy hes a celebrity but does he have the judgment and experience that comes from a life long service in one sector or another
8096368 thats what the choice for a president comes down to it doesnt come down to a choice between the abstract and the abstract it comes down to a choice between two people
8096369 you cant avoid that comparison youve got one candidate with a lot of experience and one with virtually no experience
8096370 i cant imagine anybody who is ready to debate joe biden
8096371 im not sure when john mccain will make his vice president announcement or who itll be
8096372 i have confidence in his instincts hes proven time and time again that those instincts serve him well and i think hell make a wise choice
8096373 its fitting that george bush and john mccain will be appearing together in the twin cities because its awfully hard to tell them apart
8096374 decided that for this next critical stage of the age we would have fresh editorial and executive leadership
8096375 discussing with andrew the ways his skills and expertise can be made available within the company
8096376 we need to make sure that people know these are improvements that are really needed
8096377 its unthinkable that were so far behind in this area
8096378 we need to make a commitment to bring public school standards to the 21st century
8096379 while there is no national turnaround in residential real estate prices it is possible that we are seeing some regions struggling to come back which has resulted in some moderation in price declines at the national level

8096385 weve run out of several brands where the manufacturers didnt see ahead
8096386 this is the first time mainstream america is viewing the scooter as a practicality not a toy
8096387 i have nothing in a street bike for sale under 750cc as we speak
8096388 fifty miles to the gallon bikes dont sell as well as 80 miles to the gallon
8096389 we have college kids right up to 75 year old men
8096390 with a backpack and under the seat space you can get a lot on a scooter
8096391 theyre kind of in vogue and youre seeing more of them on the road
8096392 in some cases weve seen riders not wearing helmets which can lead to more serious accidents
8096393 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time
8096394 the day of reckoning approaches and its going to be glorious its time to go to war
8096395 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8096396 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our candidate
8096397 like everything else in life there are times that you have to make an adjustment
8096398 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8096399 you three children are so na ve truly you cant comprehend the situation you let yourselves get involved in now you and all the people around you
8096400 let it be know to all living creature in this world and all others that the ironclads have just started to carve the pathway to eternal reign
8096401 there is a new group of chosen ones they will carry on what we have left unfinished
8096402 im ok youre not the message were sending nonbelievers and why we should stop
8096403 democrats dont deserve to win just because republicans deserve to lose
8096404 government is the name we give to the things we choose to do together
8096405 i am a victim you are a victim we are all victims lets all be victims together ressentiment lo volt
8096406 much more consciously feminist than hillary was at the beginning of the campaign
8096407 jeez kevin calling you an asshole would be a huge understatement wouldnt it
8096408 you made me laugh and yes youve even made me cry
8096409 i was in front of the front row last night
8096410 last night before i went to the floor i saw that theres a press lovely its air conditioned
8096411 then theres a little room off to the side and its dark and its dank were clearly not allowed to mingle with the big kids im hoping in 2008 or 2012 well get past that
8096412 other than that its amazing we have our own space
8096413 physical presence counts for a lot in 2004 there were bloggers but we didnt have a space what it says is we are here we are present in a way we havent been before
8096414 its an interesting time to meet my fellow bloggers and learn a lot more about how the sausage gets made
8096415 its fun to be part of a community thats merging into its own in the progressive community
8096416 you guys are a couple years ahead of us as far as the use of internet in politics
8096417 with raising money people have to be used to using their credit card online or used to giving their e mail out
8096418 its not about technology per se its more a cultural thing
8096419 im not making money out of blogging but its not exactly a hobby since it helps my job
8096420 the access to the convention center is the most important thing if you want to be able to say you attended
8096421 but to be honest the big tent is much better
8096422 theres an obama mania in greece and europe in general
8096423 the media loves him and bloggers love him too since hes used the internet in his campaign i hope he keeps them mesmerized after the election if he gets elected when it really becomes difficult
8096424 i spent a week in iowa with my 14 year old daughter freezing our butts off for john edwards
8096425 i live in a place in alabama where i cant get cell phone access from my house and i cant use wireless internet because we dont have broadband out in the country
8096426 edwards spoke to those issues when edwards pulled out i just kind of checked out and waited to see
8096427 that was really nice because it made us realize people actually care what were writing and want to hear from us
8096428 the room we were offered was 45 a night so we jokingly referred to it as the blogger crackhouse
8096429 one of our bloggers is staying at the media housing though and he said its basic economy lodging and we wouldve been fine there
8096430 i wish i could tell you i was a good political blogger
8096431 i was actually across town eating ethiopian food you dont get it in alabama
8096432 we are concerned that this is going to go up
8096433 we anticipate that the 2008 poverty rate is going to increase with the housing and oil factors and rising unemployment and the cost of everything is really going to take a toll
8096434 in 2008 we have only the beginning of a recession
8096435 we know the numbers will be worse unemployment has gone up 2 percent in rhode island and gasoline and oil prices have gone up significantly the price of gasoline nationally has gone up 37 9 percent according to the bureau of labor statistics from july of 07 to july of 08
8096436 the poverty level is not a good measure to gauge how we live
8096437 we really are concerned that this doesnt give a very good view of the real cost of living in rhode island
8096438 but there are still excessive variances to buffer and setback requirements and any development on this lot will impact habitat
8096439 staff recognizes that successful wetland restoration in this location has the potential to provide preferred habitat for both resident and migrating wildlife species and believes that such restoration is possible on this site however staff also recognizes the disturbance and impacts from the proposed residential construction which will occur to wildlife currently utilizing the site

8096441 serious illness caused by west nile virus is uncommon and has been identified in a small number of people in massachusetts for the past several years
8096442 additionally west nile has been found in horses mosquitoes and many species of birds throughout the state the mosquitoes that carry this virus are common throughout the state and these mosquitoes are found in the city as well as in the woods and other less populated places

8096446 and lot went up out of zoar and dwelt in the mountain and his two daughters with him for he feared to dwell in zoar and he dwelt in a cave he and his two daughters and the firstborn said unto the younger our father is old and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth come let us make our father drink wine and we will lie with him that we may preserve seed of our father and they made their father drink wine that night and the firstborn went in and lay with her father and he perceived not when she lay down nor when she arose and it came to pass on the morrow that the firstborn said unto the younger behold i lay yesternight with my father let us make him drink wine this night also and go thou in and lie with him that we may preserve seed of our father and they made their father drink wine that night also and the younger arose and lay with him and he perceived not when she lay down nor when she arose thus were both the daughters of lot with child by their father
8096447 apakah moral dari kisah itu apakah yang awak belajar darinya
8096448 he was detained because he was believed to be a security risk
8096449 he was released when after review he was determined not to pose a threat
8096450 we will be seeking more specific information about why he was picked up and held and about his experience during his incarceration
8096451 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8096452 appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8096453 we need leaders who see our common ground as sacred ground
8096454 i know has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and john mccain for president
8096455 i didnt always comport myself in the way that i wanted to
8096456 america must stand firmly on the side of freedom and justice
8096457 ive never been a team i shouldve been a one man band
8096458 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it tonight
8096459 for those who supported the women who have run the women who are holding office please remember its not just about politics
8096460 its really personal because when you start running you have no idea where the path will lead
8096461 are united we will elect barack obama president of the united states
8096462 though she did not get our partys nomination i believe in many ways hillary clinton came out of that nominating process as a winner
8096463 she showed the world that women can compete at the very highest levels in american politics she was eloquent and tough with the strength of an olympian
8096464 we need a president and a vice president with whom we can work
8096465 to work as hard for barack obama as you did for me
8096466 i know a little about the way the white house works
8096467 and you know if the president is not exactly on our side call the first lady
8096468 im not going to see him like i used to
8096469 he told me he said dont stop speaking when he comes into the station
8096470 and she said you know hes the same ol joe
8096471 instead night after night week after week year after year he returned home to wilmington on a lonely amtrak train
8096472 a seventy five minute trip passes really quickly when youre talking with joe
8096473 some mornings he would ride down on the train and literally buy the entire car and conductors coffee
8096474 its what we call relationship repair they want to repair infidelity or having grown apart or a relationship that was not very close
8096475 its kind of a promising concept though i suppose only a very small percentage of married couples are doing it
8096476 but i think that it is something that i would personally encourage
8096477 celebrities in particular are at risk for special person syndrome
8096478 if somebody grows up with special talents if they are taller smarter or more athletic than others they can see themselves as being in a special category and that makes the rules not apply to them
8096479 they have never really learned how to be a teammate they have always been in the limelight alone but marriage is a two person game
8096480 often when people first pick someone to marry their heart knows what they are doing
8096481 at the same time perhaps at least one of the partners does not have the skill set to maintain a successful marriage over time the irritation grows and the affection fades
8096482 when i see many of them interact in my office i often say that i 100 percent agree that they need to divorce themselves from that old marriage
8096483 but thats a separate issue from whether they want to remain life partners
8096484 they can stay married but they need new ways of addressing the complications and situations that come up between two people trying to live life as a duo
8096485 but when they were in church they heard something in a sermon that made them realize they wanted to be together after all
8096486 she said you know i dont think we would have made it if it were not for that ceremony
8096487 usually the flame is renewed just by being together again
8096488 if you just remarry on the basis of rekindled affection people who do not have these important skills who go for a second round are more patient with their partners
8096489 that can get them through but they are still better off if they learn these skills
8096490 i would not advise anyone to do this out of desperation and say im going to save my marriage
8096491 forget all the little excuses and just answer one question
8096492 i possess the fundamental skill necessary to succeed so i can now face lifes challenges

8096505 we had up to 10 inches of water in the whole store its a 2 000 square foot store so it completely covered the entire store and bottom row of all the inventory and stock
8096506 you could smell the dankness i guess that could be the right word
8096507 im perfect for this job because i can walk into any place and know immediately if theres mold or anything in the air
8096508 it actually is so much better than the ozone machine it actually penetrates through the walls and the ceilings and the floors
8096509 weve had blowers and dehumidifiers in here that has helped as well
8096510 we dont mind a little shameless self promotion and sell outery

8096528 one thing thats interesting is that the two tracking polls
8096529 why now athletes now have more responsibilities and we want to help their professional development
8096530 there are more fans more media and more sponsors we want to help our athletes as best we can succeed off the golf course as well as on it
8096531 a lot of korean players think they are being targeted but its just because there are so many of them
8096532 global tour and is not targeting any specific player or country
8096533 it is important for sponsors to be able to interact with players and have a positive experience

8096574 i am not at all claiming that this is what science has established about religion we dont yet know
8096575 notwithstanding what he has written is just an extravagant speculation based upon his hope for what is the case a pious account of his own atheistic longing
8096576 moral democracy suffers from the same structural weakness as its political counterpart an inherent mandate to appeal to the lowest common denominator
8096577 it is certainly a quixotic assertion considering that these family values atheists are half as likely to get married twice as likely to divorce and have fewer children than any other group in the united states

8096598 the united states will not take north korea off the state sponsor of terrorism list until we have a protocol in place to verify the dismantling and accounting for koreas nuclear program

8096601 i can confirm that us personnel remain on the ground at the yongbyon facility monitoring the sites

8096606 but i do question his ability to deliver them when and if he does become prime minister given that the opposition coalition that he leads is comprised of three parties with widely differing agendas and ideologies
8096607 with explosions continuing and a fire raging it is quite treacherous for rescuers since there are huge amid the blasts along with leaks of toxic gases such as ammonia and formaldehyde
8096608 police have surrounded government house they are not going to disperse the crowd we are trying to negotiate

8096613 they considered it important and told their units not to leave evidence of the people they had assassinated
8096614 most of those who were disappeared are in graves or thrown in the river especially the cauca or magdalena rivers and it will never be possible even with enormous effort to find them
8096615 we just wanted to give our institutions a heads up that our examiners are going to be focusing on this area

8096630 i think i was a good wife with the fact that hanggang ngayon eh mahal pa rin ako ng ex husband ko it only means that i was a good wife

8096640 were extremely excited to be doing our 100 th program
8096641 since our inception in 2006 the cell phone junkie programs have been downloaded by more than 100 000 listeners so we believe were providing a valuable service to many people
8096642 obviously there is a humorous side to the cell phone industry

8096649 he and his neoconservative foreign policy types that he agreed with are one of the reasons that george w bush decided to go to iraq
8096650 the fear is that the firefox policy will force some sites to use certificate authorities but will make others not use any security at all
8096651 unfortunately their aircraft was not able to land so we initiated search operations as early as that around 10 last night their aircraft is still missing up to now and were conducting search and rescue operations concentrating on the 20 mile radius around davao city international airport
8096652 were still verifying really as to what really transpired because this is something very unusual the aircraft and the pilots were all ok before take off and everything was normal until that time
8096653 we are conducting investigations to determine the cause of the incident
8096654 the air force has been in the limelight because of our airstrikes of milf lawless groups
8096655 we will expand that search area as we have combed the area radius by radius
8096656 we have no problem about maintenance we have no problem about aircraft spares we have expert maintenance personnel and we have maintenance facilities that meet international standards and we have spare parts that are original equipment manufactured
8096657 most probably crashed thats why we are concentrating our search within a 20 mile radius
8096658 this is the 48 bit lba limit if you are using windows xp you will need to install service pack 1 or later if the bios is incorrectly reporting the size you will need to check to see if there are any bios updates to fix it being a k8 i dont expect that its a bios issue
8096659 it is what a man must do i will not take and defile you in such a way
8096660 in alta we will marry and turn from mexico forever for us my love there is nothing here that can heal us not a thing in this revolution i have fought in it for too long and now i have killed a priest they will try and find me before i reach the border when the time comes we will find a way to escape for now let me go and release a little more anger
8096661 these are my brothers all is now lost this is horrible for me maybe we should have gone south to guatemala we will have to take a boat to baja the government might not catch us on the seas this is getting too close too close for such a man as myself starting a new life
8096662 we will spend richly extravagantly all the way through mexico
8096663 this money will be no good in america so we might as well live generously on the road to freedom
8096664 why have my people turned against me i would jump into the sea but i am afraid it would cast me back out worse off than i am now
8096665 my dear little flower i suppose you are what dreams are made of right alta will be a new beginning
8096666 you see all of this water lita it is so grand it is here for us the fish the sand the waves the moonbeams that shine on them forget this revolution there are bigger testaments of our faith out there that are more important than this damned country america is out there too and it is in that country where we will build a legacy for ourselves and for our children
8096667 ah so you think you have grown into a civilized man you there with your new clothes your new hair your new moustache and your stolen money come now renaldo there is nothing for a man like you in america besides the authorities will catch you before the border they will execute you come back and join the revolution before it is too late before you are dead you are no good to pancho villa as a lifeless carcass he has said himself that youre a good man he will change you come back and you can escape this murderous trail and lie of a good life
8096668 and that is why you are here to stop me
8096669 your name will be cleansed if you were to come back
8096670 you have lost taste for the revolution what have you lost the very tip of your forked tongue you have lost taste for life country and for your brothers then look around there is more to this life than beautiful seas good food and young so called victims
8096671 perhaps life has a flavor much deeper than revolution miguel
8096672 do not worry there will be food and comfort and more fruit for you to eat all along the way we begin tomorrow
8096673 i tried to do this the way of our people with a forgiving heart
8096674 but the revolution has lost its patience and there is a bounty on your head worthy of bringing you back to the mainland
8096675 with all the fighting we have done together we have had such a strong brotherhood
8096676 i am sad to say the bounty says dead or alive and so i must do this with justice in mind you understand you may even have done the same at one time
8096677 damn you for your allegiance to pancho villa damn you all you do not know the truth
8096678 the truth be quiet young girl you are nothing but a defiled victim of this revolution once the daughter of a proud farmer now a whore
8096679 kill me then that is the only way i will go with you
8096680 that could not have been our great grandmother stories like that only exist in movies dad
8096681 some remember the bullet hole in litas shoulder my father said he played with worthless mexican money as a child it is a story as true as the desert wind blowing through your blonde hair
8096682 because that day on his way to the church before he killed the priest and stole the money he saw litas other sister

8096686 global private equity firms are itching to write a cheque in india for a few hundred million dollars and this would represent a major opportunity for them
8096687 as it is people who see more fat people around them may themselves be more likely to gain weight young people who think many of their friends binge drink are likely to do so themselves
8096688 girls who think their peers engage in early sex are more likely to do so themselves peer pressure and social norms are powerful influences on behaviour and they are classic excuses
8096689 our need and not just in relation to public health issues is to act on the environment while fostering positive peer pressure and social norms we have to take away the excuses
8096690 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a new cold war
8096691 but we dont want it and in this situation everything depends on the position of our partners
8096692 it is contrary to the principles of the peace agreement which russia recently agreed and to recent russian statements

8096696 since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us
8096697 every temptation is an opportunity of our getting nearer to god
8096698 i decided i needed to make a change and i turned to god
8096699 bryan credits two things with getting his life back on track his success in sports that led him to college and his belief and acceptance of the christian faith

8096701 you trying to say jesus christ cant hit a curveball
8096702 jesus said you are the salt of the earth but salt does not exist for itself when is the last time you went to someones home for a meal and said man this is great salt honey how come we dont have salt like this at home we gotta switch brands salts calling is to lose itself in something much bigger and more glorious and then it fulfills its destiny we were made to count we were made to be salt but the quest for significance is a delicate dance if i do it by myself for myself its death if i do it with god for others its life
8096703 entered into an unhealthy relationship on an emotional level with a female member of his staff

8096708 franklin called me and said he thought the movie was dorky but i think its good and positive and i think it honors the lord and my mother and daddy i dont know why franklin felt like he had to make a public statement i wish hed just left it alone

8096716 pfizer only promotes the use of its medicines for approved indications cytotec is off patent with at least two generics and we are not actively marketing the brand
8096717 pfizer has not studied cytotec for the purpose of labor induction or for the early termination of pregnancy nor do we intend to
8096718 sometimes people talk about this as a passport to the er
8096719 they take enough so it looks like theyre having a miscarriage and then they have an aspiration procedure
8096720 we spoke of 5 000 10 000 deaths a year
8096721 i confess that i knew the figures were totally false but it was a useful figure widely accepted so why go out of our way to correct it with honest statistics
8096722 this is a big change in blubber and if it continues it could make it more difficult for the whales to survive it indicates there have been some big changes in their ecosystem
8096723 i dont think you could measure this by other non lethal means
8096724 this is the first time a long term decline in energy storage in minke whales has been demonstrated
8096725 explosive harpoons and a large calibre rifle in the event that death was not instantaneous
8096726 lots of dead bodies will provide robust data so if you kill lots of whales then you will be able to get some information the question is whether the benefits outweigh the number of whales killed and how they were killed scientific whaling is not about science and there is no pressing conservation need that requires it to be done
8096727 journals need to think very carefully about information that comes from this source different journals have different ethical standards
8096728 senator biden is a strong supporter of the supreme courts roe v wade ruling which mandated abortion on demand
8096729 biden has not voted on the pro life side on any issue since 2003
8096730 he has played a leading role in blocking or trying to block the nominees to the supreme court who were opposed by pro abortion advocacy groups such as robert bork clarence thomas john roberts and samuel alito
8096731 biden has supported the hyde amendment and some other laws to prevent tax funding of abortion while obama advocates the repeal of the hyde amendment and supports tax funded abortion on demand
8096732 biden voted for the federal law that prohibits partial birth abortion and in april 2007 biden said i make no apologies for it
8096733 but obama opposes the ban on partial birth abortion and expressed strong disagreement with the supreme courts april 2007 action in upholding it
8096734 it is also noteworthy that in 2001 biden voted for the language of the federal born alive infants protection act which recognizes babies who are born alive during abortions as legally protected persons while obama killed a virtually identical bill in the illinois state senate in 2003

8096738 the ibraces system allows us to straighten teeth without people seeing the appliances
8096739 there are other systems out there that achieve similar results and i use those systems on the right candidates but certain corrections and results cant always be achieved without the use of brackets and archwires
8096740 we suggest strictly enforced government mandated daily dose limits for toxic metals in all dietary supplements and requirements that all manufacturers demonstrate compliance through independent third party testing
8096741 by 2020 we might have nine billion people on the planet we could have a very big middle class driving millions more cars and we could be in a really resource hungry world with the oil price climbing and a supply situation in libya russia and saudi where natural gas is limited
8096742 it is those drivers those conditions which will encourage the possibility of landfill mining
8096743 once plastic is in a landfill site it pretty much sits there doing nothing and the beauty of that is that youre able to go back and recapture it in the future
8096744 there are some really buoyant prices around because plastic is all manufactured from oil so as the raw price of oil goes up every commodity derived from it goes up accordingly
8096745 over a period of a very long time many decades we have had a policy of burying whatever we can in landfill sites so there are valuable resources in those sites
8096746 and wherever there are valuable resources there is always the temptation to investigate whether its worth recovering them the logic is sound but the practicalities are complex and you have to balance those out with the commercial viability
8096747 several pilot studies have been carried out for research or pre feasibility studies in countries in europe but also in china japan and india
8096748 for example landfills in sweden dating from the 1960s have a lot of waste building material reflecting the construction boom of that era
8096749 and other landfills have very specific waste like those used by vehicle breakers which have high concentrations of aluminium copper and iron scrap
8096750 the value of these materials varies daily with global market prices and today there is considerable demand for scrap metal from china for instance
8096751 just imagine the resources that are lying in those landfills it could be incredible
8096752 but the insane thing is that we are talking now about investing millions into tapping into a resource under the ground when the real tragedy is that every week were still dumping tonnes and tonnes of plastic into more landfills its an act of vandalism against the environment
8096753 cancelling these subsidies might reduce greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 6 percent a year while contributing 0 1 percent to global gdp
8096754 governments should urgently review their energy subsidies and begin phasing out the harmful ones
8096755 many fossil fuel subsidies are introduced for political reasons but are simply propping up and perpetuating inefficiencies in the global economy
8096756 some countries spend more on subsidies than on health and education combined they stand in the way of more environmentally friendly technologies
8096757 i really tried to emphasise here that this process up to copenhagen is a golden opporutnity for african countries to make sure that the next regime does meet their needs in a much better way
8096758 they need to formulate what is essential to them to act both to limit emissions and to adapt to the impacts of climate change
8096759 africa has to know whats to the liking of africa
8096760 africa is still not profiting from the instruments we have
8096761 countries have developed a better understanding here of how they want to deal with deforestation how they want to reward people for forest conservation
8096762 i think theres a strong sentiment in the room especially among developing countries that a decision to address a sector is something you decide at the national level
8096763 its not something that you could or should try to impose at the international level
8096764 in my job as a dive guide i have seen many things from being right in the middle of a feeding frenzy with silky sharks to watching orcas eating hammerhead sharks
8096765 but nothing compared to what i saw that afternoon last august
8096766 it was 4 30pm and i and six guests were at darwins island set to make the fourth dive of the day
8096767 as we were on the boat checking our equipment i saw a big white thing by the surface of the water
8096768 at the beginning i could not tell what it was i had never seen anything like it before
8096769 so i decided to put my mask on and put my face over into the water
8096770 right after this i explained to my guests that it looked like a white whale shark and we were going to all jump in the water and try to follow it
8096771 i told everyone to keep a distance and not disturb it so we all jumped in the water and followed it for five minutes
8096772 i kept up swimming with it and i got very close even the eye was white
8096773 then we all went back on the boat and we spotted the shark again and we all jumped into the water again this time only with snorkelling gear
8096774 i free dove 50 feet down and is when i finally managed to get some pictures of it
8096775 it was difficult because i did not want to frighten it away so i stayed a few metres away
8096776 after a few minutes the albino disappeared and nobody has ever seen it again
8096777 the whole experience from the moment i first saw it to the time it swam away lasted around 30 minutes
8096778 i was very excited but it was not until we came back to the boat that i finally realised and understood how special this sighting was
8096779 it was a unique experience and was maybe the best gift that my beautiful islands couldve ever given to me
8096780 an atmospheric pressure drop at wind turbine blades is an undetectable and potentially unforeseeable hazard for bats thus partially explaining the large number of bat fatalities at these specific structures
8096781 given that bats are more susceptible to barotrauma than birds and that bat fatalities at wind turbines far outnumber bird fatalities at most sites wildlife fatalities at wind turbines are now a bat issue not a bird issue
8096782 slow reproductive rates can limit a populations ability to recover from crashes and thereby increase the risk of endangerment or extinction
8096783 an atmospheric pressure drop at wind turbine blades is an undetectable and potentially unforseeable hazard for bats thus partially explaining the large number of bat fatalities at these specific structures
8096784 given that bats are far more susceptible to barotrauma than birds and that bat fatalities at wind turbines far outnumber bird fatalities at most sites wildlife fatalities at wind turbines are now a bat issue not a bird issue
8096785 the chances that it a new un scheme to slow deforestation will go ahead in my mind are much higher
8096786 what i saw and heard in our debates on sectoral actions and approaches was a very fruitful debate
8096787 we used to cut down a lot of trees to plant cocoa cutting down trees used to be normal
8096788 elephants come to raid our crops then we have to buy food elsewhere
8096789 there seemed to be a lot of will and support for the idea that the communities should be receiving benefits
8096790 there is an overall understanding that aiding local people is an important part of what we should do
8096791 we learnt from experts in zambia that elephants dont like pepper
8096792 elephants have a very good sense of smell and stay away from the pepper ive tried it myself it was 100 percent successful
8096793 the average battery chicken walks in a very ungainly way they kind of lurch from side to side when they walk this chicken looks a lot more agile and healthy
8096794 if you took the average chicken from a factory farm and plonked it down in a small households backyard in bangalore it wouldnt be able to run away from a cat or dog if it needed to and it would probably get ill very quickly because its immune system is seriously undermined
8096795 this chicken if a dog was trying to catch it could fly away its sturdier and does very well on scavenging household waste
8096796 were encouraging the farmers so that they can have healthy food in their diets and also they can make income make money out of this
8096797 its down to the economics a fast growing breed costs less to produce and therefore costs less to the retailer
8096798 its all being driven by what the consumer wants and farmers and companies have been driven to produce that
8096799 the indian ocean hosts some of the most diverse reefs in the world
8096800 current marine protected areas dont show any potential for faster recovery than non protected areas
8096801 the west indian ocean lost about half of its coral and some areas lost up to 90 percent
8096802 we need to focus on areas that are recovering faster or escaping the impacts of climate change
8096803 this is where your brood stocks of coral areas are that will help seed other areas
8096804 at what point does a baby get human rights in your view
8096805 well i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
8096806 what we are doing here with this bill is to create one more burden on a woman and i cant support that
8096807 instead of people gathering to develop a culture they want to escape from other people individuals believe they can reach a level of self sufficiency that can isolate them or their family in an ideal place then they somehow expect the civilisation that has made them to serve them its a parasitic kind of life
8096808 it was not a community for communitys sake eating tofu and giving each other back rubs
8096809 it was the opposite of the hippy scene a community of construction workers if you were going to be here you were going to work harder than youd ever worked in your life
8096810 paolo was central to everything he was an unbelievably dynamic speaker everywhere he went his energy was obvious through word of mouth a steady stream of people came we had to send people away in the end the kitchen couldnt cook more than 1 000 meals a day
8096811 i was driven by emotions i never sat down and said what am i going to do now i was too busy
8096812 utopia is a pretty stupid notion it says if any group anywhere develops some ideal condition this condition is legitimate and i say forget it if you are surrounded by all sorts of demeaning or painful conditions then utopia is just an arrogant notion that has no room for evolution
8096813 we have this unstoppable energetic self righteous drive thats innate in us but which has been reoriented by limitless consumption per se it doesnt have anything evil about it its a hindrance but multiply that hindrance by billions and youve got catastrophe
8096814 by eating the pests that damage coffee crops birds can provide a valuable service to coffee farmers
8096815 this is one of those win win win situations something that is good for the farmer good for the birds and good for the environment
8096816 as soon as the brokers take a sample and see there is damage by the coffee berry borer the price goes down immediately
8096817 birds are always going to be cheaper than using pesticide
8096818 the coffee berry borer is an incredibly difficult insect to control and the only way to make a dent in its population levels in the field is by using an arsenal of strategies
8096819 the recent findings from jamaica indicate that birds could be an important part of the arsenal to fight this pest
8096820 we found that across all studies birds reduce all arthropods which include insects spiders and crustaceans and plant damage
8096821 we have always had an appreciation that birds played a role in controlling the coffee borer but had no idea that the effect was as significant as johnsons research has shown
8096822 this is changing the way we farm as we now are looking at ways to attract more birds to the coffee fields including preserving more woodland and ensuring that the shade trees are maintained within the coffee fields
8096823 although they prefer forests we found that these manakins also leave the forest sometimes and travel between fragments
8096824 many people think that shade coffee means bird friendly coffee
8096825 these areas are host to some of the worlds most biodiverse coral reefs and habitat and some of the most interesting and compelling geological formations in all of our oceans
8096826 however if the president establishes these new sites as no take reserves where no extractive activity is allowed it would be one of the most significant environmental achievements of any us president
8096827 the president is on the cusp of conserving more territory than any leader has ever done thats an amazing legacy to leave the nation
8096828 these are among the only base lines that we have left of what the ocean was like hundreds of years ago
8096829 these places are completely different from what we know anywhere else theyre totally dominated by their predators
8096830 imagine the serengeti with five lions per wildebeest this is kingman reef
8096831 you wouldnt necessarily need to have the entire thing protected but its very important to have key areas fully protected
8096832 there is risk in this from a conservation standpoint in that if it doesnt go right it could be a step backward
8096833 if he does this before he leaves office he could go down in history as being the best president on ocean conservation
8096834 i bet most of the opposition for the enlargement of the protection will come from the tuna fishing industries
8096835 its largely uninhabited and its difficult and expensive to do surveillance and enforce regulations
8096836 we may be faced with the extinction of another one the vaquita in mexico
8096837 there are several more on the list both small and large cetaceans
8096838 clearly we are called upon to act before the status of a stock or a species reaches that level of concern particularly if the threat is of a relatively simple nature for example directed takes
8096839 we are going to do the same types of things
8096840 what we have done here for the last two years has been successful if something isnt broke it doesnt need to be fixed
8096841 the thing with jamie is that he can move around the pocket
8096842 as the spring progressed he got better and better throwing the football i think he can do some really good things he is a winner and i am excited about him he has worked hard is a smart kid and i feel good about where he is
8096843 obviously losing omar is a great loss but we have a guy coming in who is similar
8096844 losing kenny cattouse at running back we have a guy who is similar losing gary banks at receiver we have guys who can take up for that loss
8096845 we are going to miss gary banks no question about it
8096846 his production well be able to replace that but what will be hard for us will be to replace his leadership we have guys who can do all of the things that did except we dont have the big strong physical guy right now
8096847 we had a couple of guys we knew were pretty good but those guys played a lot better than we thought a lot of the credit for that goes to john schlarman but they played higher than expectations this year they will be called on to lead the offense
8096848 we are going to lean on those guys a lot to lead this offense and i expect us to be better than we were last year and we were pretty good up front last year
8096849 it makes me feel a little better with a young quarterback and young running back having those guys up front
8096850 we are going to do some stuff with those guys to protect those corners a little at least until we see what they can do hopefully two of those corners will step up and we wont have any worries in the secondary we feel pretty good about the nickel and the safeties
8096851 we have dion gales steve mclendon and maurice coleman back inside and two of those three have started we have to have a little help there on the interior
8096852 at end we lost shawn todd but we get brandon lang back from injury we have a couple of jc guys coming in and a couple of young guys coming on for depth with lang kenny mainor and cameron sheffield all pretty good guys back the biggest deal is depth we have to add some bodies and build up
8096853 boris has gained some weight up into the 220s which will be 20 25 pounds heavier than last year
8096854 he has another year of experience he is a wonderful football player but he needs to keep getting better
8096855 kit homes were sold via mail order catalogs and shipped to the wanna be homeowner in about 10 000 pieces
8096856 as we see the longhorns and their fans celebrating abcs cameras catch leinart and carroll hugging and leinart whispering the words god i wish i knew how to quit you all right i made that up
8096857 man i really want to attack this hill but i dont wanna leave you guys
8096858 who put this hill here im going to have a word with mr armstrong about this
8096859 a pickup pulled out and i had to stop short
8096860 a mack truck cut me off and flung me into a ditch
8096861 in addition to fulfilling your new years fitness resolutions and raising needed funds for the children of st jude this is also your opportunity to be a part of history by creating a new guinness world record for the most abdominal crunches done in one hour by a group
8096862 im extremely proud to lead this national campaign to benefit a very worthy cause while educating women on the importance of strengthening their core as a first step to greater fitness
8096863 st jude is an incredible research center where doctors and researchers are committed to saving the lives of children with cancer and other deadly diseases
8096864 our family is forever grateful for the courageous people at st jude and all that they do ab crunch challenge participants will be a part of a vital team supporting the hospitals life saving work and ensuring that no child is ever turned away because of a familys inability to pay
8096865 we think we have identified a pathway that can be used to prevent tumor formation and a potential target for therapy
8096866 we were interested in whether there were signals that inhibited tumor formation
8096867 and if there were which ones were they could they be used to identify new therapeutic targets
8096868 what was not known and what we now find is that the effect of bmps on normal gnp cells is almost exactly mimicked in gnp like tumor cells
8096869 what we a found is that using a lower dose of the sonic hedgehog inhibitor in combination with bmp gives the same therapeutic effect as high doses of the hedgehog inhibitor
8096870 we hope that by reducing the levels of both compounds we might prevent the secondary effects on bone of this potential therapy
8096871 autophagy is a cell survival jack of all trades and were trying to understand the signals that trigger its onset
8096872 this process developed so early in the evolution of life that at least some types of microorganisms must have learned how to avoid this defensive response of the cell to being invaded we want to know how invading microorganisms avoid being destroyed by autophagy and learn how cancer cells use autophagy to resist chemotherapy drugs before they have a chance to work
8096873 we suspected that because tlr signaling triggers both phagocytosis and autophagy that this signal might also link these activities together as well as enable each process to occur separately
8096874 this would make sense since autophagy kills microorganisms that invade the cell and phagocytosis deliberately brings microorganisms into the cell to destroy them so having two totally separate and unrelated sets of signals to do a similar job would be like re inventing the biochemical wheel
8096875 this strongly suggested that tlr recruits parts of the autophagy machinery to enable the phagosome to fully develop and fuse with the lysosome even if autophagy itself doesnt occur simultaneously
8096876 we can actually see phagocytosis take place in live cells and we can study it in detail so we know the steps involved
8096877 but autophagy seems to occur suddenly and we know about it only after its very obviously underway now that we discovered that phagocytosis uses some of the same biochemical signals as autophagy does we can use that information to solve the mystery of how autophagy works we hope that we will be able to translate that new knowledge in the future into improved treatments for infections and cancer
8096878 our report reflects how adept st jude has become at designing and conducting even complex clinical trials for twinning through iop
8096879 this is a powerful strategy for sharing our knowledge and skills with countries that have excellent clinicians but limited resources
8096880 through twinning we can ensure delivery of state of the art therapy to children in other countries while identifying additional research opportunities
8096881 we think we have identified a pathway that can be used to prevent tumor formation and a potential target for therapy
8096882 we were interested in whether there were signals that inhibited tumor formation
8096883 and if there were which ones were they could they be used to identify new therapeutic targets
8096884 what was not known and what we now find is that the effect of bmps on normal gnp cells is almost exactly mimicked in gnp like tumor cells
8096885 what we found is that using a lower dose of the sonic hedgehog inhibitor in combination with bmp gives the same therapeutic effect as high doses of the hedgehog inhibitor
8096886 we hope that by reducing the levels of both compounds we might prevent the secondary effects on bone of this potential therapy
8096887 its time to hand the torch to the next generation of young people to continue this important role of st jude in the international community
8096888 dr websters legacy is that he has highlighted the importance of the avian reservoir of influenza as it relates to human health
8096889 we now know that the avian reservoir is the initial source for all human flu he has helped the world understand that we need to keep an eye on whats going on in the animal populations and communicate with each other about those changes
8096890 richard has attended who meetings and has been accepted by the international community
8096891 gene expression profiling will help us identify targets for future therapy
8096892 it is still crude but in the end you identify multiple genes for further study if you find a good target for therapy the next step is to develop molecular therapeutics for the target
8096893 pharmacogenetics is important to finding out a persons response and tolerance for a therapy
8096894 certain drugs may be good for 99 percent of patients but bad for 1 percent we need to find out who those patients are who are at risk so we can spare them from toxicity
8096895 we need to know the leukemic cell genetics that affect drug sensitivity or resistance and what role pharmacogenetics plays in treatment to improve efficacy and decrease toxicity
8096896 that way we dont over treat low risk patients or under treat high risk patients
8096897 effector t cells mediate immune responses like accelerators make cars go forward while a specialized population called regulatory t cells stop an immune response like brakes slow down a car
8096898 regulatory t cells actively suppress the activation of effector t cells that are reactive and damaging to self tissues thereby preventing autoimmune disease
8096899 in the context of an infection after the effector t cell has orchestrated the correct immune response and the pathogen is gone regulatory t cells can help calm down the immune system
8096900 in contrast there are very few that issue stop signals only two or three so il 35 is special
8096901 this discovery adds significantly to our understanding of how these cells prevent immune responses from running out of control and causing damage
8096902 to return to the car analogy il 35 may turn out to be a very important brake for the immune system
8096903 there is mounting evidence that regulatory t cells stop our ability to eradicate tumors
8096904 tumors produce a dilemma within the immune system on one hand the system wants to get rid of the tumor cells but on the other hand theyre a part of us thus regulatory t cells may prevent the immune system from attacking the tumor experimental studies have shown that if you can remove regulatory t cells or dampen their activity then tumor immunity becomes vigorous and the body can get rid of the tumor
8096905 regulatory t cells are seen as a major impediment to the development of effective anti cancer vaccines and may prevent sterilizing immunity in certain chronic infections such as hepatitis c and tuberculosis
8096906 blocking the activity of il 35 may reduce the function of regulatory t cells and their ability to block anti tumor immune responses so treatments that block il 35 activity may make anti cancer vaccines more effective
8096907 when i interviewed with dario he said the best thing about st jude is that your only limitation is your imagination and he was right
8096908 one of the best things about science is the fact that your discovery attracts the interest of other bright minds other scientists will hear about il 35 and say maybe this new protein is important in the disease process or condition that im studying by collaborating with others whose expertise is different than ours we can hasten progress
8096909 i believe this protein has a good chance of having therapeutic applications
8096910 im a st jude donor myself and like other donors i think its important to remember that at the end of the day the goal of our research is to treat patients especially the children we have here at st jude
8096911 this is probably the first description of what is happening mechanistically that contributes to the ability of cells to delay apoptosis
8096912 it provides incredible insights into how three proteins work and how they can control apoptosis
8096913 this suggests that the protein is playing basically the same role in humans as we described in mice
8096914 that was intriguing because several studies suggested that hax1 was controlled by cytokine signaling
8096915 also studies have suggested that if you overexpressed hax1 in cells the cells were protected from undergoing apoptosis
8096916 that additional window of survival is extremely important because in the body cytokines are limiting
8096917 the key observation was that hax1 was important in helping cells to survive importantly what happened to the mice we generated was remarkably similar to what happens if you remove the mitochondrial enzymes called htra2 or parl
8096918 the new information is important because it helps identify children who are most at risk for severe disease using easily available clinical information
8096919 this narrows down the patient population who needs to be considered for antiviral therapy which is costly and often inconvenient to receive from a childs perspective for example one treatment for rsv infection is to have the child breathe an aerosolized form of the antiviral drug ribavirin for 12 to 18 hours which is tough for the child and the parent
8096920 this finding is important because with cancer patients clinicians are used to identifying those at risk for bacterial and fungal infections based on a patient having neutropenia
8096921 we decided to analyze the course of rsv infection in children being treated for cancer to identify factors that could help us predict which ones were at highest risk for severe disease or death due to a lower respiratory tract infection with this virus
8096922 proteasome inhibitors are currently being used to treat some types of cancer including multiple myelomas although many aspects of this cellular process remain poorly understood
8096923 our study sheds new light on how that process works
8096924 we wanted to determine what happens to defective heavy and light chains in plasma cells so we could get a better understanding of the molecules and channels that allow these cells to get rid of defective proteins that cant be used to make antibodies
8096925 the class of cancer drugs called proteasome inhibitors block endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation as well as the destruction of proteins from other parts of the cells and cause defective proteins to overload this system
8096926 we want to fully understand how endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation works for antibodies made by plasma cells so we can design more specific ways to block this process in myelomas
8096927 our study shows for the first time the role herp plays at the retrotranslocon
8096928 the study also describes how non glycosylated proteins are removed from the endoplasmic reticulum and disposed of this information helps to explain how the process works and how we might design ways to block it in cancer cells
8096929 decreased levels of transforming growth factor beta and increased levels of jnk are known to be associated with the transformation of myeloid cells into leukemic cells in humans
8096930 so those findings in our lab suggest once again that n myc is linked to aml
8096931 by eliminating il 3 from the culture we were able to unmask the apoptotic effect of n myc which greatly increased cell death
8096932 each year the samaritan award is given to a broadcaster or organization that exemplifies the industrys commitment to serving the public interest through the airwaves
8096933 country cares is a program that truly embodies the spirit of this award as apparent through their tireless fundraising efforts and dedication to serving the patients of st jude childrens research hospital
8096934 there are a lot of heroes out there in radio who continue to make this happen
8096935 im just so happy and surprised by all the people especially in country music whove taken st jude to heart
8096936 he put on a mask too when we had our picture taken together
8096937 im just excited to be here doing what i can to help
8096938 the artists who come here need to take what theyve learned and pass it on the type of care offered here is revolutionary
8096939 all these people took the time out of their busy schedules to come here and help the kids
8096940 i dont want people to ever forget about st jude
8096941 long lived cells like those in the brain arent constantly being replaced like red blood cells are
8096942 these cells must have a way to remain healthy for a long time getting rid of mitochondria that threaten the cell by making ros is one of those strategies
8096943 the fact that reticulocytes must eject their mitochondria in order to form red blood cells makes it the perfect model for studying programmed mitochondrial clearance
8096944 the identification of nix as a protein that regulates programmed mitochondrial clearance is a significant advance because of the importance of this process in the health of long lived cells like those in the heart and brain
8096945 jim nantz has received many awards and honors in his outstanding career with cbs sports
8096946 to have the honor to present him an award that bears my name will indeed be a very special moment for me
8096947 at univision and at each of the local stations in the univision radio network we are proud of the role we play for hispanics in the united states
8096948 our work with st jude is another example of our commitment to our communities the amazing response of our staff and listeners since we started our partnership 10 years ago demonstrates the importance of the st jude message of hope
8096949 we are very fortunate to have the support from univision radio and the hispanic community to ensure that no child is ever turned away from receiving treatment because of a familys inability to pay
8096950 we want the community to know that every donation even as little as 20 a month makes a difference in saving a childs life at st jude
8096951 part of my job is to motivate people when i see this for myself i want to make sure we have a very successful radiothon
8096952 eighty five percent of every dollar received comes to the hospital thats a very high number for any charity
8096953 i saw every hallway every child and every smile as i was sharing with my listeners
8096954 it makes you feel good to know you are a part of this
8096955 its a simple dance really you just take two steps back and grab your wallet welcome to the mississippi shakedown
8096956 there certainly seems to be a disproportionate number of contributions from the greater ripley booneville new albany area
8096957 it is amazing to me that in spite of being under investigation by the attorneys general millercoors intends to introduce sparks red with an even higher alcohol content in october consequently today i have sent a letter to leo kiely the chief executive officer of millercoors asking for copies of documents regarding the marketing strategy for sparks red i just wish the company would respond more responsibly as did anheuser busch i guess millercoors lust for the corporate annual profits of 114 million off of the caffeinated drinks overrides their concern for our young people
8096958 its a simple dance really you just take two steps back and grab your wallet welcome to the mississippi shakedown
8096959 its a simple dance really you just take two steps back and grab your wallet welcome to the mississippi shakedown
8096960 there certainly seems to be a disproportionate number of contributions from the greater ripley booneville new albany area
8096961 site you must determine if it is legal for you to access this site from the computer you are on we are not responsible for you accessing this
8096962 a series of complex developmental processes must be carefully orchestrated for the eye to form correctly
8096963 one important aspect of this coordination is that retinal thickness be the same irrespective of eye size for example the mouse eye is about 5 000 times smaller than that of the elephant eye but the retinal thickness in these two species is comparable
8096964 this represents the first example of a role for a myc gene in retinal development
8096965 on the basis of our data we propose that n myc plays a central role in coordinating retinal proliferation with eye growth during development
8096966 the determination of n myc target genes during retinal development may also contribute to the current understanding of retinoblastoma progression
8096967 importantly for retinas to maintain nearly constant thickness across species that have different sizes of eyes the total number of retinal cells must change several fold
8096968 the identification of n myc as a key regulator of these processes allows us to begin to understand the coordination of complex developmental programs in the developing eye and how these processes have evolved
8096969 one of the main reasons my family and i support st jude is because there is always something you can do for someone else
8096970 it costs more than 1 2 million a day to run st jude so every penny counts whats really cool about st jude is that it doesnt matter about things like race religion or a familys inability to pay they are really here to help the kids and that is what is really important it is great to be able to encourage kids to learn and help other kids at the same time
8096971 give thanks for the healthy kids in your life and give to those who are not
8096972 i am so proud that these buildings are joining the thanks and giving campaign to support st jude
8096973 through their dedication nearly 75 000 chilis grill amp bar team members made the 2007 create a pepper to fight childhood cancer campaign a resounding success
8096974 this years campaign once again exceeded our highest expectations totaling more than 8 2 million for the patients of st jude bringing us closer to our goal of raising 50 million and making the chilis care center building we are dedicating today a reality
8096975 as we stand at the foot of the chilis care center in celebration today i want to thank chilis grill amp bar and our other partners who helped make this dream possible we are truly overwhelmed by your dedication to help st jude provide unsurpassed patient care and unparalleled scientific research and you can know that you have helped bring hope to thousands of children from around the world
8096976 the chilis care center is a significant part of our long term strategy to translate basic research at st jude into the most advanced and effective care of patients
8096977 integrating patient care and research holds the key to more rapid advances in science and medicine this new facility will help us maintain our leadership role in defining the forefront of research to advance the treatment of children with cancer and other catastrophic pediatric diseases

8096979 making eagles on the tour takes on a whole new meaning with the eagles for st jude program because i know my accomplishments help st jude achieve its mission to find cures for these special children
8096980 it touches my heart to see these brave kids they have so much courage to fight it makes me feel proud every time i make an eagle and it gives me added drive and passion to play my best golf
8096981 st jude is vital in the battle against catastrophic childhood diseases and we want the world to know it it is our hope that the eagles for st jude program will increase awareness for this special place and encourage golf fans and those who support st jude to donate to this worthy cause
8096982 eagles for st jude is a wonderfully unique program that shows stanfords amazing commitment to the kids of st jude it will be thrilling to watch the eagles accumulating throughout the pga tour knowing that each one will help support st judes ground breaking research and life saving care
8096983 on behalf of the entire global stanford financial group of companies let me say how honored we are to present this check to st jude childrens research hospital
8096984 this tournament is the flagship event for stanfords global relationship with st jude and we look forward to continuing to work together to raise funds and awareness for the battle against childhood cancer we were very pleased with the success of this years tournament our first as title sponsor and to be able to present the largest donation in the history of this event is a true honor for me st jude and these incredible kids is the reason we are involved and im delighted that we can do our part to help st jude work its miracles
8096985 with our donation today and as we have for the last 22 years fedex has supported the incredibly important work being done at st jude childrens research hospital
8096986 we remain strongly committed to this great organization through our continued involvement with the stanford st jude championship and we look forward to carrying on our charitable giving on a national level through the many opportunities with our sponsorship of the fedexcup
8096987 obviously i have my own motivation to make as many eagles as possible but with the eagles for st jude program theres an even greater reward when i do so eagles for st jude allows me to share that good feeling that i have on the golf course and turn it into something truly lasting and meaningful off the golf course i feel like my accomplishments help st jude accomplish its mission to find cures for these special children
8096988 we are grateful to stanford financial group and fedex for their commitment to make this event even more successful than in years past to see a professional like vijay singh get behind our event and support it with both his time and his money is very gratifying we see the stanford st jude championship only growing and we know thats because of the sincere and long term commitment by these incredible partners
8096989 if you go out to eat for lunch or dinner on september 24 by going to chilis you will help seriously ill children become the ultimate survivors on that day chilis restaurants nationwide will be donating all their profits to support st jude
8096990 many times physicians will look at a childs scans and assume that it is impossible to remove the tumor while preserving some uninvolved kidney but our study indicates that surgeons should not rely solely on the imaging to make that decision
8096991 in most cases the surgeon will be able to save normal kidney on both sides
8096992 the study indicates that when combined with chemotherapy and radiation therapy this surgical approach provides an opportunity to preserve renal function while maintaining a high probability of cure
8096993 commonly when a child has bilateral disease the surgeon will remove the kidney that has the most tumor and do a partial nephrectomy on the other side
8096994 but if a patient then develops problems in the remaining kidney the options are limited because one kidney has been taken out of the equation at st jude we try to save as much kidney as possible in children with bilateral disease thus far 100 percent of the time we have been able to save normal kidney on both sides
8096995 among the many mysteries surrounding autoimmune diseases is why they can sometimes take decades to manifest themselves
8096996 our findings hint that this delayed onset could be explained by subtle defects in the molecular controls on t cells
8096997 the itams we studied are little molecular tags inside the cell by which the t cell receptor communicates to the rest of the cell
8096998 the mystery we wanted to address was why the t cell receptor needs 10 itams to do its job why not just have a simple on off switch
8096999 we theorized that there were two possibilities why the immune system needs so many itams
8097000 one is that the requirement was purely quantitative and that the itams were there for signal amplification the second possibility is that different itams do slightly different things they do have slightly different structures so maybe they bind to some signaling molecules better than others and their positions in the t cell receptor are different so while our primary observation is that quantity is more important than itam type we also found that type has some influence
8097001 one implication of our findings is that a relatively small defect in the efficiency of signal transduction through the t cell receptor could give rise to a subtle failing in negative selection which gives rise over a long period of time to a few overly active t cells that might initiate autoimmunity
8097002 clearly from our studies there is the possibility that you dont really need a very big reduction in t cell receptor signal strength to have a defect in negative selection
8097003 we were surprised to find that many itams were required to make t cells divide and expand but only one or two was required to make t cells secrete cytokines
8097004 we believe this idea that t cell signaling acts more like a rheostat than an on off switch offers significant new insights into how t cell development and function is controlled
8097005 the new information is important because it helps identify children who are most at risk for severe disease using easily available clinical information
8097006 this narrows down the patient population who needs to be considered for antiviral therapy which is costly and often inconvenient to receive from a childs perspective for example one treatment for rsv infection is to have the child breathe an aerosolized form of the antiviral drug ribavirin for 12 to 18 hours which is tough for the child and the parent
8097007 this finding is important because with cancer patients clinicians are used to identifying those at risk for bacterial and fungal infections based on a patient having neutropenia
8097008 we decided to analyze the course of rsv infection in children being treated for cancer to identify factors that could help us predict which ones were at highest risk for severe disease or death due to a lower respiratory tract infection with this virus
8097009 our findings show that children under 3 years with dpg can potentially respond better to treatment than older children
8097010 unlike other previous studies in young children where the diagnosis of dpg was based on either ct scans or magnetic resonance imaging mri the diagnosis of all our patients was based on mri only ct scans are not able to differentiate between dpg a tumor that occurs in the brainstem and other tumors which originate in the same area with a better prognosis
8097011 we believe that the more we learn about dpgs the more likely we will be able to design more effective treatments for children of all ages with this tumor
8097012 even though pneumococcus is very common until recently no one had realized that it could develop this pilus to reach out and touch a human cell
8097013 oral streptococci which are normally in the mouth and throat have the pilus genetic package and we believe pneumococcus picked it up in the back of the throat we decided to look at how the bacterium figures out how to use that package
8097014 when bacteria attack the lung there are two steps they need to do to establish pneumonia
8097015 they need to stick to lung cells and they also need to invade the lung cells our experiments were designed to separately test those two steps and we established that the pili are not used for adhesion but for invasion which was not understood before
8097016 so far only 20 percent or so of the clinically important strains of pneumococci have developed this trick of producing the proteins for making pili
8097017 in creating vaccines we want to use proteins that occur in a wide variety of bacterial strains these pili related proteins are not prime candidates so we can now concentrate on other proteins that we know are expressed almost universally by pneumococci and that we can put into a vaccine
8097018 current vaccines used in the developed world cost over 100 a dose and are limited to protecting against perhaps 10 to 15 types of pneumococci
8097019 but that price is far too high for developing countries and there are 90 types of pneumococci out there
8097020 target presents varietys power of youth campaign is a powerful one one that harnesses the energy of more than 150 young performers who are in a position to influence their peers and fans with the support of target and our other sponsors the power of youth effort has the opportunity to generate millions of dollars to benefit st jude childrens research hospital and create a bedrock of social awareness within the next generation of entertainment
8097021 our partnership educates and encourages young individuals to take action in their community
8097022 this event is important to target because of our long standing relationship with st jude childrens research hospital and the meaningful work they do
8097023 my father opened the doors of st jude through the generosity of the entertainment community
8097024 target and variety continue the tradition of entertainers giving back to people in need the dedication and enthusiasm of young hollywood and partners like variety and target enables us to carry on my fathers vision that no child should die in the dawn of life
8097025 this motility is also called dancing because when you electrically stimulate an outer hair cell with a sound the cell body spontaneously elongates and contracts along with the sound
8097026 it is very dramatic to see these hair cells dance with the sound
8097027 we found that these mice showed exactly the same kinds of hearing deficiency as the previous knockout mice
8097028 therefore we believe that these experiments eliminate criticism of our earlier experiments with the knockout mice
8097029 with this study we still cannot really exclude stereociliary motility from contributing to cochlear amplification because eliminating somatic motility also reduces ciliary motility so it is not possible to totally isolate either form of motility in fact we hypothesize that the two mechanisms might work together in different aspects of amplification
8097030 for example an overdose of aspirin causes a high frequency hearing loss by inhibiting prestins function
8097031 also there is evidence that many cases of high frequency hearing loss are caused by defects in the cells molecular machinery that involves prestin and two mutations that have been detected in the prestin gene in humans are reported to be associated with deafness
8097032 the discovery is important because it explains why patients with sialidosis have enlarged spleens and suggests that new drugs or gene therapies that target that problem might be an effective therapy
8097033 the results also explain how the loss of neu1 can cause bone marrow transplantations to fail and therefore suggests that such failures might also be corrected by target therapeutics
8097034 our work represents an unexpected and important clue to one of the prominent clinical manifestations of sialidosis patients
8097035 we were surprised to discover that an old ubiquitous enzyme in lysosomes better known for digesting cellular waste products plays such an important role in a basic biological process that when exacerbated contributes to the outcome of such a terrible disease in children
8097036 the evidence strongly suggests that in children lacking a normal gene for neu1 disruption of the bone marrow environment causes the exodus of hematopoietic cells from the marrow to the spleen
8097037 that leads to development of the symptoms of sialidosis although we dont have a cure for this terrible disease we are now beginning to identify alternative ways to improve the disease outcome in affected children
8097038 the exciting thing about this work is that it sheds light on two major issues the cause of sialidosis and the reason for bone marrow transplantation failure in the absence of neu1
8097039 this wealth of new information gives us a better understanding of the physiological function of neu1 which appears to be much broader than originally thought this illustrates the important role of basic research in making discoveries that have major implications for medical problems
8097040 these findings are important because while genes that cause hpe have been identified the interactions among those that produce hpe are not only complex but poorly understood
8097041 this represents a first step in understanding the mechanism of that interaction
8097042 this is good evidence for what has been called the multi hit model of hpe
8097043 in this model it takes mutations in both six3 and other genes in the sonic hedgehog pathway to produce the severe pathology of hpe
8097044 sonic hedgehog is a major player in embryonic development in the brain as well as elsewhere in the body
8097045 so this new understanding of its regulation in this very limited time and place in the brain helps us understand at a molecular level some of its overall role in brain formation
8097046 among the many mysteries surrounding autoimmune diseases is why they can sometimes take decades to manifest themselves
8097047 our findings hint that this delayed onset could be explained by subtle defects in the molecular controls on t cells
8097048 the itams we studied are little molecular tags inside the cell by which the t cell receptor communicates to the rest of the cell
8097049 the mystery we wanted to address was why the t cell receptor needs 10 itams to do its job why not just have a simple on off switch
8097050 we theorized that there were two possibilities why the immune system needs so many itams
8097051 one is that the requirement was purely quantitative and that the itams were there for signal amplification the second possibility is that different itams do slightly different things they do have slightly different structures so maybe they bind to some signaling molecules better than others and their positions in the t cell receptor are different so while our primary observation is that quantity is more important than itam type we also found that type has some influence
8097052 one implication of our findings is that a relatively small defect in the efficiency of signal transduction through the t cell receptor could give rise to a subtle failing in negative selection which gives rise over a long period of time to a few overly active t cells that might initiate autoimmunity
8097053 clearly from our studies there is the possibility that you dont really need a very big reduction in t cell receptor signal strength to have a defect in negative selection
8097054 we were surprised to find that many itams were required to make t cells divide and expand but only one or two was required to make t cells secrete cytokines
8097055 we believe this idea that t cell signaling acts more like a rheostat than an on off switch offers significant new insights into how t cell development and function is controlled
8097056 this finding represents a key extension of other studies on puma because such loss had never been shown before in human cancer
8097057 on the one hand patients receiving traditional chemotherapy can suffer the loss of immune cells and this loss occurs in part because puma induces the death of these cells
8097058 in this case the goal would be to protect patients bone marrow by developing drugs to inhibit puma on the other hand for patients with a lymphoma in which puma was inactivated drugs could be used to reactivate the gene to trigger apoptosis and kill the tumor cells
8097059 because the control of cancer in the bone marrow has improved so much cns relapse has become proportionally more important
8097060 if we are to further increase the cure rate and improve the quality of life of our patients we need to concentrate on preventing cns relapse
8097061 most clinicians still feel strongly that high risk patients need radiation treatment because they think that without radiation such patients have a very high risk of relapse
8097062 but i disagree i think that we should avoid using radiation in all patients even those at high risk of relapse with optimal chemotherapy we can reduce the relapse rate to a very low level we should reserve radiation for the treatment of relapse whats more the salvage rate for cns relapse in patients who did not receive prior radiation is very high and if patients who are treated with radiation develop bone marrow or cns relapse later on it is more difficult to treat them successfully
8097063 optimization of intrathecal therapy to allow adequate distribution of intrathecal therapy in the cns and to avoid traumatic lumbar puncture which leads to an increase in cns relapse are essential for the success of cns directed treatment
8097064 however there are no conclusive trials that show this approach to be superior to intensive chemotherapy
8097065 so whether transplantation has any role in the treatment of isolated cns relapse is uncertain
8097066 cns relapse may just be the tip of the iceberg meaning that while we may see cns relapse there may be hidden leukemia in the bone marrow
8097067 at st jude our treatment protocols involve detecting subclinical cns leukemia early and treating it aggressively
8097068 such treatment has allowed both good cns and bone marrow control therefore we have achieved excellent outcomes for our patients
8097069 our findings show that children under 3 years with dpg can potentially respond better to treatment than older children
8097070 unlike other previous studies in young children where the diagnosis of dpg was based on either ct scans or magnetic resonance imaging mri the diagnosis of all our patients was based on mri only ct scans are not able to differentiate between dpg a tumor that occurs in the brainstem and other tumors which originate in the same area with a better prognosis
8097071 we believe that the more we learn about dpgs the more likely we will be able to design more effective treatments for children of all ages with this tumor
8097072 it was definitely an honor to win the stanford st jude championship last year not only because of the talented field i competed against but because of the special place this tournament holds in this communitys heart and the wonderful charity it benefits
8097073 i look forward to returning to memphis in two months to defend my title
8097074 celebrating our 51st year in memphis the stanford st jude championship has a very rich history
8097075 it is the strong support of the community as well as the commitment from dedicated sponsors such as stanford financial group and fedex that make it one of the longest running tournaments on the pga tour were excited with the way this years field is shaping up and were looking forward to entertaining our fans with another first class tournament
8097076 this is a call to the global community that it is possible to increase pediatric cancer survival even in countries that have high under 5 mortality rates for other causes such as infectious diseases
8097077 with a modest financial investment we can improve survival very quickly
8097078 that is because these countries have developed twinning programs with st jude and other institutions
8097079 the data show a modest investment in health if it is well organized can produce an incredible increase in pediatric cancer survival
8097080 countries with limited resources should not be afraid to tackle pediatric cancer as a national health priority because they can have decent programs if they make a relatively small investment
8097081 and that investment can come from outside sources as well
8097082 these findings emphasize that patients with aml especially those with high white blood cell count should be treated in an experienced tertiary center with a good supportive care team
8097083 for example at st jude we have a dedicated team of clinicians taking care of aml patients and they are more aware of the need to treat hyperleukocytosis are more experienced and are more vigilant in patient care than is usually found at a less specialized hospital
8097084 even though we had dramatically reduced early deaths in this group of patients in the latter period of the study the long term result for patients with these complications was still not good
8097085 we have continued to address their problems with new treatment approaches and have now improved not only the early results but also their long term outcome

8097115 surely you must have some sort of defense mechanism that enables you to look away from all that sadness or numb yourself to the horror of a dying child
8097116 we speak frequently and proudly about the medical marvels that take place within the walls of st jude
8097117 but we all know none of this could be accomplished without the love dedication and financial support of each and every volunteer partner corporate sponsor and donor it is because of you that the most gifted doctors and scientists in the world come here to do their finest work

8097141 it is always gratifying to see one of the nci designated cancer centers achieve comprehensive status recognition of excellence not only in state of the art care and cancer research but also in patient education community outreach and the dissemination of vital information to professionals and the public
8097142 these extra efforts to establish programs that reach out to surrounding communities and patients are the hallmarks of our comprehensive centers which now number 41 this enhanced designation is a timely recognition of important contributions and advances made by the dedicated staff of st jude
8097143 being designated a comprehensive cancer center is a prestigious accomplishment and to be the only pediatric center is an incomparable distinction for st jude
8097144 st jude is well known for having innovative programs led by the best and the brightest faculty and staff now being awarded comprehensive stature places an additional nci imprimatur on st jude and further validates our position among the countrys leading cancer centers this also speaks volumes about dr kastans strong leadership as our cancer center director
8097145 its rewarding to see a designation of comprehensive to an institution that is exclusively focused on children
8097146 they have a huge population of survivors that they alone have the resources and capability to bring back for follow up studies so they are to be congratulated and envied in that they are the only uniquely pediatric cancer center in the country
8097147 our international outreach program directed by dr raul ribeiro is a wonderful example of how a medical institution can provide important services to local national and worldwide communities
8097148 in addition to the effective web based efforts st jude has a long and successful track record of bringing modern medicine to less advantaged countries through education of local health care providers and establishment of pediatric cancer clinics
8097149 while maintaining significant activities in education and community service st jude will continue its major efforts in both basic laboratory research and clinical investigation to better understand the biology of cancer and develop novel treatment approaches
8097150 these findings provide new avenues to pursue to gain a better understanding of these disease processes and ultimately to develop better therapies
8097151 it really takes a series of genetic lesions to lead to cancer
8097152 you may get activation of an oncogene but you may also need activation of a tumor suppressor gene and an alteration in a cell death pathway
8097153 it appears from our study and other work published previously that all you need to get cml is that chromosomal translocation and bcr abl1 expression
8097154 the vast majority of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemias are of b cell lineage
8097155 the loss of the ikaros gene is a nearly obligatory lesion for the development of bcr abl1 all
8097156 and clearly must be a genetic lesion that is cooperating with bcr abl1
8097157 that is an important finding that may give insight into how that transformation occurs or it may give insight into a better way to treat the disease if one can figure out how the ikaros deletion is working
8097158 a major issue we face in managing patients with recurrent sarcomas is the paucity of active agents
8097159 there is a limited number of drugs that are active against bone sarcomas and these are usually used as front line treatments when the sarcomas recur we have essentially no active agents
8097160 we were first very careful to see whether we would see any excess toxicity in children compared to that seen in adults
8097161 when we found that the combination was well tolerated we used it in more patients since our colleagues at rady childrens hospital were also using it for refractory sarcoma we decided to pool our data
8097162 further evaluation of this drug combination is warranted in these patients
8097163 this is probably the first description of what is happening mechanistically that contributes to the ability of cells to delay apoptosis
8097164 it provides incredible insights into how three proteins work and how they can control apoptosis
8097165 this suggests that the protein is playing basically the same role in humans as we described in mice
8097166 that was intriguing because several studies suggested that hax1 was controlled by cytokine signaling
8097167 also studies have suggested that if you overexpressed hax1 in cells the cells were protected from undergoing apoptosis
8097168 that additional window of survival is extremely important because in the body cytokines are limiting
8097169 the key observation was that hax1 was important in helping cells to survive importantly what happened to the mice we generated was remarkably similar to what happens if you remove the mitochondrial enzymes called htra2 or parl
8097170 some t cell receptors are adept at promoting autoimmunity some are poor and some are protective it is not clear why one t cell receptor can promote autoimmunity whereas another t cell receptor on a similar kind of t cell either doesnt do anything or even protects against autoimmune reaction
8097171 this finding of an association between t cell engraftment and spontaneous disease suggested to us that there is some barrier to the development of disease
8097172 why are cells that engraft better more likely to cause disease we really dont know the answer once the mice start to get disease they get very sick but there is sort of a triggering point our findings may suggest that disease triggering in these models involves a mass effect that requires some quantity of specific t cells to ignite disease but we really want to find out whether it is the cell number itself or whether receptor recognition properties that lead to increased engraftment also lead to increased susceptibility to disease these are things we can test
8097173 these findings dont have a direct clinical implication right now but if we understand which t cells induce pathology and why and which cells are protective or passive we will gain a better sense of where to target what are called antigen specific therapies
8097174 those therapies try to selectively target the t cells that cause disease sparing the rest of the immune system
8097175 many times physicians will look at a childs scans and assume that it is impossible to remove the tumor while preserving some uninvolved kidney but our study indicates that surgeons should not rely solely on the imaging to make that decision
8097176 in most cases the surgeon will be able to save normal kidney on both sides
8097177 the study indicates that when combined with chemotherapy and radiation therapy this surgical approach provides an opportunity to preserve renal function while maintaining a high probability of cure
8097178 commonly when a child has bilateral disease the surgeon will remove the kidney that has the most tumor and do a partial nephrectomy on the other side
8097179 but if a patient then develops problems in the remaining kidney the options are limited because one kidney has been taken out of the equation at st jude we try to save as much kidney as possible in children with bilateral disease thus far 100 percent of the time we have been able to save normal kidney on both sides

8097187 donating our estate to st jude was the best decision my husband and i have made
8097188 we are relieved to see our estate going to such a great cause

8097231 i am not saying everyone has to be christian this is not a homogenous nation
8097232 what you have to be is someone who believes in a judeo christian ethic in other words in knowing theres a right and wrong my lord made it very clear to me that im a cultural warrior for judeo christian values
8097233 the government of the united states is not in any sense founded on the christian religion
8097234 christianity neither is nor ever was a part of the common law
8097235 oh blessed one may i not come to the complete awakening if when i have done so it is not then the case that women in all buddha lands throughout the ten directions who listen to my name have serene faith and aspire to awakening and who hate the forms and statuses imposed upon them as women shall not on entering my land be liberated therefrom

8097240 you wouldnt associate with neo nazis but russell pearce does
8097241 all border activists constitutional study groups and tax protestors and especially any white heritage club members have been labeled as domestic terrorists
8097242 we were an organization that first spotlighted the fact that he attended an event held by the national vanguard a neo nazi organization here

8097247 showcase is a fun filled weekend of events for the whole family to enjoy it features mans best friend working to provide funds for the best friend of children in need st jude
8097248 this is truly a win win event because the thousands of out of town exhibitors also have a major impact on the memphis economy
8097249 we can all make a difference in the lives of others im proud to help st jude i feel like im just a regular person helping out
8097250 i have to be honest i didnt know much about st jude childrens research hospital before the create a pepper to fight childhood cancer campaign in 2006
8097251 that was my first introduction to the hospital and i was real excited about the fundraiser i got involved right away in doing whatever i could to make it a success but i have to say that this year is so much more personal for me
8097252 there was a pearl like reflective glow to her eye
8097253 we looked at them wondering if this was going to be katie soon
8097254 a lot of times in children as young as katie the treatment breaks down the bones in the face
8097255 they were tactful and truthful that meant a lot we made the decision based on quality of life concerns we felt it was best for her but that didnt make it easy
8097256 even people we just briefly met they all let us know that they were there for whatever we needed
8097257 we got messages and e mails from chilis employees all over the country sending us their thoughts and prayers
8097258 thats huge thats huge when youre going through this theyve given us all the time off weve needed to take care of our family were very grateful to have that
8097259 it was a shock to see her hooked up to the iv lines and oxygen
8097260 well forget that she lost an eye we honestly forget
8097261 we joke that every time she comes home from the hospital she has a new toy
8097262 once she gets outside she loves nothing better than just running through the grass
8097263 if we find a resource to help us and we think it might help another store we share it
8097264 i think this approach will be just as effective if not more
8097265 all of the materials are provided for you and are ready to use so all we had to do was make it happen
8097266 with st jude we play our music our format isnt disrupted
8097267 even if a radio station isnt ready to put on their own radiothons
8097268 they should definitely visit another stations event to see what goes on
8097269 the people that tune you in keep us moving forward
8097270 were going to have a banner hanging in our student union that says we are the 2006 2007 national champions
8097271 but the only thing harder than being no 1 is staying no 1
8097272 i have no idea if we are going to reach it but we will give it our best shot
8097273 for the first three years i helped peripherally i got prizes for their events
8097274 i saw it as a program that had a lot of potential
8097275 i thought it was something we could really turn into something big
8097276 weve had some great support and some great students and it has worked out for us these past few years
8097277 what i had been told about the hospital didnt compare to what it is actually like there
8097278 talking with students from other colleges and hearing about the programs that work for them was very educational
8097279 it gives us new ideas on what we can do at our campus
8097280 if we start making it a competition we lose sight of what st jude is about
8097281 we have 16 000 people on our campus and 10 percent of them participate in the event id like to believe we can get more than that if we do our job right in promoting the hospital the money will come
8097282 because we share a common background we understand the little quirks that may pop up
8097283 having gone through the same thing we know exactly what we need to do for each other to make things better
8097284 its amazing all the changes since 1998 when we were last here
8097285 i see the other survivors and i know even though we shared a different time and a different era that we all have the same thing in common
8097286 we were all patients here at a place that was our last hope
8097287 show me my way in life and i will build you a shrine
8097288 non profit non sectarian charitable corporation titled alsac dedicated to the parable of the good samaritan to love and care for our neighbor regardless of color or creed

8097291 we are immensely proud of the fact that no child has ever been turned away from st jude because of an inability to pay and we at alsac know that our success and the success of the hospital has been solely dependent on the kindness and generosity of our donors alsac was founded on the principle of the good samaritan we have been fortunate to know and call as friends hundreds of thousands of good hearted donors in our half century of service

8097298 we raised 610 000 for the hospital and had a wonderful time going about it my thanks to the forbes family for allowing us the use of their yacht which added to the events theme
8097299 thanks to everyone that made our st jude event one very classy night to remember god bless all the people involved with st jude and god bless all the children

8097306 richard shadyac is a visionary an excellent planner and his focus his tenacity his dedication and his passion for st jude are unrelenting
8097307 i became an arkansas state trooper i married my high school sweetheart i have two wonderful children and three grandchildren
8097308 how proud he would be of all of you how proud he would be of his grandchildren singing out for alsac and how proud he would be of alsac the organization that was born in his heart and built on his faith fifty years later you are still the warriors slaying the dragons that would take children from their mothers and fathers
8097309 the metaphoric rock upon which alsac was built 50 years ago
8097310 the responsibility of alsac is herculean in scope to maintain the largest pediatric research center in the world like the inn keeper who was left with the guardianship of the suffering man we at alsac also stand guard

8097319 since 1978 more than 80 cases of lead poisoning associated with ayurvedic medicine use have been reported worldwide
8097320 this study highlights the need for congress to revisit the way dietary supplements are regulated in the us
8097321 our first priority must be the safety of the public herbs and supplements with high levels of lead mercury and arsenic should not be available for sale on the internet or elsewhere
8097322 several indian manufactured rasa shastra medicines could result in lead and or mercury ingestions 100 to 10 000 times greater than acceptable limits
8097323 the medicines which are supposed to cure sickness should not promote another illness due to the presence of toxic materials such as lead

8097332 the most likely course is for beijing to create yet another mechanism that limits the unlocking for a few more years it will need to be several years or it will not be sufficiently protective of current investors to lift sentiment on a sustained basis

8097336 ma le parole usate da dotto per descrivere una squadra di calcio sono effettivamente denotanti nel senso le dobbiamo prendere per realmente pensate dallautore oppure fanno parte di un gioco fumoso di connotazioni varie a cui lautore ci vuole indirizzare per poi scappare via ovvero sono tutte parole che giocano su bilanciamenti metaforici che vanno dalliperbole alleufemismo dalla metonimia irridente alla sineddoche cervellotica

8097339 one year i really ran into a lot of bad luck where i got the worst calls possible
8097340 honestly i couldnt even hit a shot because i was so nervous they would call every ball out
8097341 that really wasnt my fault i probably would have won that year and i was gonna win that year unfortunately it didnt work out
8097342 i cant sit here and say someone is going to dominate when im still playing tennis
8097343 sometimes when im in a match i do get tight and i get nervous
8097344 i always try to think of like you know current players that can work through that like rafael nadal and roger federer
8097345 if they can do it i can do it too so it takes me out of that moment
8097346 i dont know because i keep losing matches i shouldnt lose

8097359 neither the legislative nor judicial branches are parties to the lawsuit so it is absurd for jim hood to suggest some sort of conflict as his reason for begging off the case
8097360 good lawyers do not turn their backs on their clients at the last minute but this is not the first time attorney general hood has done so since ive been governor it is a shame the taxpayers of mississippi will have to pay extra to be represented because jim hood has changed his mind again about who he represents

8097410 none of the smaller african nations appeared to receive much applause
8097411 the world may never witness a ceremony of the magnitude and ingenuity as that which opens the 2008 olympics
8097412 most ambitious olympics in history opens with most spectacular show
8097413 for china before a tv audience of 4 billion this was the luckiest moment in a thousand years it is too the start of something even bigger than an olympic games it is or at least is meant to be the beginning of chinas new era of greatness witnessed and implicitly approved by much of the leadership of the planet
8097414 friends who come from far how happy we are to have you here was the message of greeting to the world even the part of the world china has had harsh criticism from
8097415 and in a stroke it made the latest polemics about bushs words on human rights slide away
8097416 because in the run up it was often not the great sporting event that dominated the news flow but the political situation in the host nation
8097417 not the economic giant growing to threatening size but a nation with an ancient culture fascinating sounds and traditional pictures
8097418 not the shocking severity of the dictatorship but what a strictly organized country can achieve if it puts in infinite effort
8097419 about china for at least the next 17 days becoming the world stage the chinese accustomed to humiliation real and perceived by foreigners for centuries are secure enough these days that they were willing even eager to share the spotlight
8097420 yet its china that plays an indispensable role in making and keeping the two countries and separate the chinese public is a bit inconsistent in cheering only one korea while admiring their unification ideal and at the same time unconscious ignorant of the role that china itself plays
8097421 do not do to others what you wouldnt will to yourself
8097422 the first sour note of the ceremony while the chinese national anthem was playing the costumed children raised their right arms in something close to a nazi salute im sure it wasnt intended to look that way but im also sure that if steven spielberg remained as a consultant he would have headed it off he bailed out of the project after getting what he regarded as inadequate answers to concerns he raised about chinas sluggish efforts to end in the genocide in sudan
8097423 but im also sure that if steven spielberg remained as a consultant he would have headed it off
8097424 only so many ways to salute with your right hand
8097425 the head of the ioc looked totally disinterested and unenthusiastic the whole time even passive aggressive it seemed that he would rather be somewhere else did somebody upset him
8097426 team japan was great they each carried both japanese and chinese national flags the only team did so
8097427 the parade of nations also had a uniquely chinese flavor instead of the usual alphabetic order the record 204 countries and territories entered the stadium in accordance with the number of strokes in the chinese characters used for the nations names with those countries whose names contain the fewest strokes coming first
8097428 did it occur to him that he was committing a sin by cheering the heretic pagan rituals complete with the commie salutes and goose stepping commie soldiers
8097429 the pioneer movement and hitler youth movement are the communist and nazi counterparts of the boy scouts movement in the west
8097430 this solute and flag ritual was originally introduced or copied from former ussr in the early 1950s
8097431 what a great show i just had a once in a life time experience
8097432 i have just made a fool of myself i will never attend another olympic or chinese event
8097433 foolsmountain wins prestigious danwei medal for best blogging on china in the categoy of
8097434 but perhaps it was too much to expect from zhang who is well known for his empty spectacular theatricality
8097435 the history of modern china not only prcs was indeed absent from zhangs opening ceremony
8097436 the opening ceremony is a unique opportunity for modern greece to share its joy in and pride of the centuries of its history a history that gave birth to ideas values and principles which enlighten us all today democracy philosophy theater sport itself the olympic games all were born in greece
8097437 if the assailant near the drum tower were uighur i think people who have assumed he was a terrorist
8097438 would any chinese olympian even imagine doing something like that if the olympics were held in japan
8097439 the head of the ioc looked totally disinterested and unenthusiastic the whole time even passive aggressive it seemed that he would rather be somewhere else did somebody upset him
8097440 also interesting that the taiwanese delegation did not carry their national flag
8097441 would any chinese olympian even imagine doing something like that if the olympics were held in japan

8097472 can you look me in the eyes and tell me that you dont love me
8097473 he loves you i dont know why but you must be very very special
8097474 you are very cute but someone else is a bit more photogenic
8097475 you are ugly and we can not show your face
8097476 the cruelest insults come from ones pretending to speak as the righteous
8097477 the overseas broadcasting enterprise is the product of two separate philosophical forces that have shaped u
8097478 you are very cute but someone else is a bit more photogenic
8097479 you are ugly and we can not show your face
8097480 the heart of the matter is that the organizers are not prepared to show a real kid singing with a real voice in a real performance because they feel that the image of their country has to be perfect
8097481 well for once the roles are reversed isnt that great
8097482 you are very cute but someone else is a bit more photogenic
8097483 you are ugly and we can not show your face
8097484 a cute little girl singing her countrys national anthem is much less impressive when you find out that a she wasnt singing live and b it wasnt even her voice
8097485 lets face it it is the greatest openning ceremony in the olympics 5000 year history a real eye opener for all non chinese
8097486 a person singing a song is much less impressive when you find out that a she wasnt singing live and b it wasnt even her voice
8097487 yang peiyi was not replaced because she was never selected miaoke was selected after the 10 year old girl was deemed too old than in the last minute they decided that the voice of miaoke was not ideal for their purpose and inserted peiyis prerecording instead what is your problem then
8097488 kong i hope we all understand that the fools mountain parable applies to both mainlanders and foreigners we all have a lot of learning to do
8097489 little girl too ugly to take part in olympic showpiece
8097490 the decision may not have hurt both girls but the hype in the media would surely hurt them
8097491 lin miaoke had no idea that the sound was being substituted and went onto the stage to perform in front an audience of billions flawlessly her composure under the pressure was something most grown up could only dream of she is the real deal
8097492 the decision may not have hurt both girls but the hype in the media would surely hurt them
8097493 if the western media is trying to create a storm on this story they are really cheap its a nonstarter too bottom line is most chinese are happy about it
8097494 its not the act of striving for a perfect production thats at issue here its how that perfection was attained as i said before the olympics is supposed to be about incredible performances of natural ability under intense pressure
8097495 their argument went something like this cnn and other western media articulated the sentiments of of tibetans cnn and other western media made some mistakes in their presentation therefore tibetan sentiments must be discounted
8097496 when such things happen in china the blame is on government and more or less on chinese people
8097497 well feel free to challenge me all you want just keep in mind im always right
8097498 perhaps its time to revise my opinion of this forum
8097499 chinas propaganda ministry deleted most online discussion entries blocked access to video links showing lin miaokes lip syncing and banned domestic reporters from reporting the story after realising that it was generating negative publicity
8097500 but read along with everything else that is written about china it gives an accurate one
8097501 childrens salute has acquired its own meaning in china to a certain extent
8097502 becoming a big media story yesterdays opening ceremony head musical director chen qigang was interviewed and revealed that
8097503 why has the prc chosen to retain so many remnants of old european fascism
8097504 it would be interesting to find numbers on how many overseas chinese students have taken part in the pioneers as kids and to see how it correlates in participation in mass events supportive of the chinese government this year
8097505 all the reports about the lip sync incident were directly or indirectly based on the interview with the music directory chen qigang
8097506 the sydney symphonys confirmation that it mimed its entire performance at the opening ceremony of the 2000 sydney olympics comes as something of a shock even worse it admits the backing tape was recorded in part by its southern rival the melbourne symphony orchestra
8097507 it the performance was all pre recorded and the mso did record a minority of the music that was performed
8097508 its correct that we were basically miming to a pre recording
8097509 japanese guy i am mr yamamoto contestant nice to meet you im shotta thats e6 and beside him is d boy
8097510 bear in mind that the measure of a man is the worth of the things he cares about if it is good to say or do something then it is even better to be criticized for having said or done it
8097511 no funciones como un aeropuerto que tu vida no dependa de si alguien llega o se va
8097512 tests for perfect pitch have always demanded that subjects already have some musical training or at least familiarity with a particular piece of music which really limits the pool of candidates you can test
8097513 that means nobody really knew how prevalent perfect pitch is in humans in general
8097514 it is a way to build distributed services across multiple vendors while still keeping your data as private and safe as you would like it to be you can limit it for example for time like only one day only read access photos only and not videos etc

8097516 i want to be able to honor the public trust
8097517 we want cme to be unbiased and science driven and we dont want it to be influenced by marketing we want our educational activities for whomever we are serving whether its our own faculty or our colleagues in the community locally or globally to be true to the science and the evidence and not be influenced by any kind of financial industry support
8097518 bias either by appearance or reality has become woven into the very fabric of continuing education
8097519 under the present system in many circumstances a cme course will be held only if a commercial company is willing to sponsor it
8097520 while for profit enterprises may occasionally engage in philanthropy it should not be surprising that the core motivation of pharmaceutical and medical device industries in supporting cme is to market their products and services
8097521 this leads to a cme curriculum which is at least in part designed to address market needs rather than being entirely focused upon improving performance of practicing physicians
8097522 clearly it would be preferable for stanford faculty to design our cme curriculum solely based upon the needs of our learners as they seek to address the health care needs of their patients
8097523 we all agreed it is inappropriate for industry to influence content
8097524 if industry really wants to enhance the education of clinicians they should be given the opportunity to do so
8097525 but we wanted to create a situation in which they had no effect on the choice of topics or their content so were happy to have industry support as long as it is provided without strings or expectations about the course content
8097526 really brings control of cme curricula back to academic medical centers
8097527 one of my hopes is to make stanford a destination so we can hold cme programs here leveraging the wonderful cultural attractions on campus
8097528 i think right now industry is under a lot of pressure in its use of marketing for education theyre re examining their role in cme as well
8097529 as we take this step my hope is that other institutions will start to follow suit i think the climate will change dramatically to enforce that if institutions do not take greater responsibility there is going to be a mandate whether its one that we initiate or one that is imposed that frees up these intertwined interactions of academia and industry around medical education
8097530 it is not exactly clear where this idea came from because there are no studies showing this to be the case
8097531 for decades people have been told that eating these foods increases complications associated with diverticular disease but our results suggest they dont
8097532 the idea that these foods should be avoided is so deeply ingrained in people that i really dont think this study will represent the nail in the coffin
8097533 but it is very well done and a useful contribution to the literature now when patients ask me about this i can tell them that there is not only no evidence of harm from eating these foods there is evidence suggesting a benefit

8097538 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8097539 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk
8097540 an occasional hot dog isnt going to increase that risk
8097541 a way to raise appropriate concern about a deadly concern
8097542 you or i might think a hot dog that just goes with baseball we can always change our traditions to be healthful
8097543 its not the kind of impact on risk that say tobacco smoking has on lung cancer but on the other hand colon cancer is one of our most common cancers so small changes still affect a lot of people
8097544 the risk we get from things like lack of physical activity excess body weight lack of adequate vegetables and fruits these are much more important to work on than to worry about

8097571 last night we were successful in making sure the american people knew where senator obama was coming from and throughout the rest of it were going to make sure that folks know exactly what the choice is between obama and mccain
8097572 dick durbin is not only the most popular democrat in the state gushed state senator barack obama of chicago but the most popular politician in the state
8097573 even up to the time that i walked on the stage where they were handing out obama signs people were thinking what is this
8097574 when he was giving the speech you knew that something was going to change
8097575 let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth
8097576 be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth
8097577 behold i have given you every plant yielding seed that is on the face of all the earth and every tree with seed in its fruit you shall have them for food 30 and to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the heavens and to everything that creeps on the earth everything that has the breath of life i have given every green plant for food

8097589 generally upping law enforcement resources makes no dent at all
8097590 but it doesnt matter how hard you jump on them tougher policing makes no impact at all
8097591 you dont negotiate or cut deals but it requires a direct relationship with the gangs
8097592 the police must say our promise to the next group to do this we will punish every single member with every legal tool at our disposal were giving you prior notice so you know what will happen
8097593 when somebody hurts somebody else the police go after everybody in the gang after a while the group starts policing itself

8097612 marriage is a great truth and i need to find some metaphor or picture i can use to show how important marriage is i know its kind of like christ and the church

8097650 while new taxes or tax increases are unlikely to be considered certainly without voter approval in these difficult economic times education needs at all levels will continue to be among the highest priorities
8097651 keeping our colleges and universities strong is vital to keeping nevada strong
8097652 a thriving and vibrant higher education system is critical to the future of our youth and to a competitive workforce and business climate
8097653 higher education is one area where there is tangible gain to our economy by offering students access to training technology and ultimately degrees
8097654 its been a wonderful 15 1 2 years for me and my family
8097655 the city of sparks has been absolutely wonderful to us these are experiences that i will cherish and never forget
8097656 i thank all of the citizens for all they have done to make our job easier in policing a great city
8097657 i know the d a r e program is probably easy to cut out of budgets but youve always been there youve made appearances at the schools for d a r e
8097658 i want to thank you on behalf of all of those kids who were educated and have not used drugs and have turned out to be wonderful citizens because your backing of that d a r e program has made a difference in childrens lives
8097659 we are very proud of the service that chief dotson has brought to the city of sparks and will miss him chief dotson has been a tremendous asset and has raised the bar in terms of community policing efforts we wish him and his wife doris the best of luck
8097660 chief dotson has served the city of sparks honorably and has made a significant contribution in protecting our citizens and keeping our community safe we wish john a wonderful retirement
8097661 have been financed by islamic charities of the iranian regime based in california and by the silicon iran network
8097662 in exchange the senator does his best to aid the mullahs
8097663 why do they say your nose runs but your feet smell doesnt make any sense
8097664 because of his position naturally he has more power and he uses it to take care of the state of nevada
8097665 so whenever you look at this project and the amount of federal funds or look across the field at the air traffic control tower under construction thats another 27 million in federal funding those are solely because of harry reid and multi year earmarks
8097666 about the issue of earmarks if they are good or bad i would like the citizens of northern nevada to take a look at our highways and look at our airport
8097667 we have a state of the art airport in every way
8097668 look at the fire trucks we have those because of the power we have in congress and we are very lucky if we ever lose that power we will never see that kind of money flowing through the state
8097669 the interesting thing about the airport is that weve got significant projects under construction
8097670 this we just finished but weve got the tower the baggage project and the hotel they are all independent of one another but they come together to create a lot of jobs for the local economy good paying jobs and they also enhance the safety and efficiency of the airport
8097671 were a little loathe to act on behalf of 28 000 people until it passes on the ballot
8097672 to get rid of it as fast as they can because of re election campaigns

8097678 beckman is not an unusual name and there could have been another application processed next to her file or something got transposed
8097679 ive heard this for a long time that the city of reno has undermined the city of sparks with cabelas and the baseball team
8097680 i havent or nobody else has ever done anything to undermine the city of sparks
8097681 if somebody in reno is doing it i expect a phone call from you and tell me whats happening
8097682 or were going to have the largest big box empty store in the world
8097683 thank you very much for letting me get that off my chest
8097684 i really thank mayor cashell for coming in here because once again when rumors get flying thats sometimes taken as the truth
8097685 i dont know where he was hearing it from but alls fair in love and cabelas and baseball so if they got a better deal in reno thats where they went thats the way it goes
8097686 i think there may be some hesitation that synergistic approach is also something that could lead to consolidation a reno sparks washoe county government merger
8097687 i can tell you i have heard every single one of you loud and clear from my time on reno city council that if consolidation were ever to happen in this region sparks isnt interested
8097688 thank you for calling dr eams office how may i direct your
8097689 the barack obama i know today is the same man i fell in daddy missing you
8097690 if the rumors are true then we might have a major kashrut problem on our hands
8097691 during one visit we found only 17 were kosher so we discontinued operations there
8097692 we are talking about drilling in a spot that the authority had already approved drilling there 10 years ago and we requested that spot because we thought theyd approve it again the district committee approved it two weeks ago and now we need the authoritys approval
8097693 we need approximately 1 25 acres out of 150 000 for two months so that we can drill an exploratory hole 2 000 meters down we had an ecological company evaluate the area there have also been other exploratory holes in the dead sea area and you cant even see them anymore
8097694 there is oil around the dead sea but the constant little earthquakes that occur because the sea is on a fault line release the pressure before the oil can be driven to the surface at this spot there is a four way closure and there is a good chance there is oil there
8097695 six and a half million barrels is worth about 800 million the government would be receiving about 400m in fees and taxes can we really afford to turn down that much money
8097696 shouldnt have crouched like a prey species in a place where dragons live
8097697 a lot of us dont get why we should give up years not to mention maybe our lives for what seems like someone elses wars
8097698 but we are as much a part of the fabric of this country as anyone else
8097699 israel is more conflicted and complicated than it may seem
8097700 until the 1980s resisting the draft was practically unheard of but kids today are thinking differently than they once were today it is easier in some circles to justify not serving
8097701 israelis grow up fed the idea that serving is our ultimate responsibility to the state
8097702 and here we offer a weeklong break from that collective narrative
8097703 its easier to lie and pretend you are nuts or get married or say you are religious or try to leave the country but i wanted to take a moral stand
8097704 and if you go to prison people listen to you
8097705 i refuse to see the policy of the government and military in the territories as the sum total of society
8097706 i will ascend to heaven i will raise my throne above the stars of god i will sit on the mount of assembly on the heights of zaphon i will ascend to the tops of the clouds i will make myself like the most high
8097707 is this the man who made the earth tremble who shook kingdoms who made the world like a desert and overthrew its cities who would not let his prisoners go home
8097708 to make his throne higher than the clouds over the earth and resemble my power on high
8097709 i have met and like john mccain but he bombed and presumably killed many people in a war i opposed
8097710 if i can set all that aside i would hope that americans will accept
8097711 this is a defining moment for the democratic party and for america therefore it is our sincere hope that senator obama dedicates the resources time and commitment to this new west
8097712 shows that our party is being serious about competing beyond the coasts and upper midwest traditionally the democratic party has been the party of the northeast the west coast and a few states in the midwest and thats about it that strategy needs to change if were going to win
8097713 more so than the new environmentalism in the mountain west and more so than individualism in the west
8097714 my view is we want to spend enough time and money to keep senator mccain and the republicans busy
8097715 i think they just need to keep doing what theyre doing and just turn up the intensity level as you head into the final stages here i think they recognize i know they recognize how important the hispanic vote is i know that theyre working hard on it
8097716 every industry has to find a way to change and provide natural options and the funeral business is the next low hanging fruit
8097717 the private cemetery regulations that require things like vaults and grave liners serve no purpose for public health and safety theyre for landscaping management maybe we need to start a lobbying effort
8097718 instead of the simple steak potato and broccoli dish were going for more vertical execution using an artichoke as a garnish or filling roasted red peppers with a salad or even using a shot glass to serve soup
8097719 i spent time in nicaragua with coffee buyers trying to assure the beans we buy are organic and im not sure everyone down there goes to the expense and trouble to make sure
8097720 a lot of this boils down to price and its hard to pass higher and higher costs on to your customers im of the theory people have been eating non organic things for a long time and life expectancy still keeps going up
8097721 i want you to recognize that this jar represents your life the golf balls are the important things your family your health your friends and the things you are passionate about if everything else was lost and only they remained your life would still be full the pebbles are the other things that matter like your job your house your car the sand is everything else the small stuff if you put the sand into the jar first there is no room for the pebbles or the golf balls the same goes for life if you spend all your time and energy on the small stuff you will never have room for the things that are important to you take care of the golf balls first the things that really matter set your priorities the rest is just sand

8097912 you cannot create in that atmosphere of confinement or sameness

8097932 si chiama nicole io sono romano dorigine molisana ma veniamo sempre qui perch la mia compagna di senigallia

8097945 unfortunately under efca a union free construction company that becomes unionized under card check will immediately be put into economic peril the reason is the nature of the construction industry itself as most construction jobs are short in duration immediately upon unionization the former union free construction company will be unable to bid on new work as it will be unable to accurately predict its labor costs since the company is either still negotiating or waiting for an arbitrator to decide its labor costs

8097955 father forgive them for they know not what they are doing
8097956 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life
8097957 and being found in appearance as a man he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death even death on a cross therefore also god highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name which is above every name that at the name of jesus every knee should bow of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth and every tongue should confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father
8097958 i have been crucified with christ and it is no longer i who live but christ lives in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by faith in the son of god who loved me and delivered himself up for me

8097980 if we continue to turn a blind eye to the growing income gap between the very rich and the rest of us well find ourselves in a country with no middle class
8097981 bridging our countrys troubling income gap starts with universal health care because working families will never get ahead if they continue to be held back by medical bills and insurance premiums they cant afford to pay
8097982 programs like schip and medicaid are lifelines for providing americans with the health care they need especially during times when the economy is soft and more people feel vulnerable to losing employer sponsored health insurance
8097983 unfortunately were still seeing an unraveling of the private insurance system

8098044 those of you who are confessed catholics may come forward at this time to receive the sacred host which is the body of our lord jesus christ non catholics are encouraged to remain kneeling and pray for the unity of all christians that we may all one day share in this sacred sacrifice
8098045 but he will only let you eat with him if you are a confessed practicing catholic in good standing in the eyes of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith the local opus dei chapter and your nearest conservative bishop
8098046 i can believe that the bread is the body of christ but i have trouble believing those little wafer things are bread

8098052 ya wouldnt know it from that mass thing yall do
8098053 knowmsayin mr c yall wants us to sit there and watch the minister and not do nothin its so borin my dad says you all catholics dont let the holy ghost work on ya cuzn yallre uptight and think religion is all about the popes rules at my daddys church people get into the holy ghost i like it peoples singin an prayin an movin an swayin i hate that mass thing its like you tryin to pray in hell mr ogrady always tellin me to sit down and be quiet when the choirs singin i cant go to choir practice after school on thursdays sos i cant be in the choir but then i try and sing wit em and ogradys tellin me to shut up and sit down i dont get it
8098054 lydia ogrady wouldnt recognize the holy spirit if it jumped up and bit him on the ass
8098055 seriously people ogrady has a common disease hes one of those people that think how you pray is more important than actually praying its not entirely his fault thats the religion he was raised with and like many catholics his age he acts as if he doesnt believe in the holy spirit because no one probably ever taught him about the spirit the religion he grew up with wasnt about feeling the spirit it was about following the rules now rules can be good things but following rules for the sake of following rules is stupid just the same breaking rules just to break them is stupid what we need to do is change the rules
8098056 you cant rap in church my daddy says that rap is from the devil its all about hatin police hatin women an takin drugs and all
8098057 what were all gonna hate on is hate now back to the action can any of you guys rap

8098064 ill take care of sister eunice and ogrady you just be ready
8098065 ogrady wouldnt recognize the holy spirit if it jumped up and bit him on the ass
8098066 a dios yahira d game que el lo dijo a tu que que el llama a roberto

8098070 thats not fair skinny you caught them and they trusted you youve got to trust them back
8098071 yes you are youre scared of falling tell ya what though
8098072 you know when frankie fell at the beginning of class and it was no big deal for him because he did this last summer at youth group at his church you remember he said that skinny
8098073 well remember how he was smiling and thinkin hes all that because he went first and he wasnt scared and how he said he was the brave man
8098074 skinny he wasnt brave at all not a drop of brave in his whole act he wasnt scared if youre not scared then its not brave thats the way it is
8098075 yes you are you will do this fall you must do this fall this fall is all that counts right now it is what you must conquer you can do it i would not ask you to do anything i knew you were incapable of doing now grasp your hands fold them up and in close your eyes and tell these guys youre ready to fall again guys make your net
8098076 make the net gentlemen now this man is on the chair and ready to fall you do nothing to make him feel safe if you are not constantly ready
8098077 you see mr c i told you i cant do it this is messed up shit youre trying psychological torture on us damn
8098078 i am not torturing you you can not fall with the oh shit response
8098079 you cant let go of your arms if they go out to the side and wack someone in the net in the head you will all tumble to the ground and someone will get hurt you have to trust them they will catch you keep your arms in now start again
8098080 come on man youre takin the whole class just fall already nigga aint no big deal
8098081 when someone is afraid to fall they need encouragement not harassment
8098082 just close your eyes wrap your hands up and into your chest and tell them to get ready to catch you
8098083 get back in here dont even try to leave this room sit your asses down right now and shut up what the hell do you think you were doing you cant just walk away from a person like that royale was trusting you she could have cracked her head open what were you thinking
8098084 one you cannot miss hon even if you could ignore her glorious young breasts you could not ignore her equally inglorious attitude
8098085 it would be un christian to flunk a student who doesnt turn in every homework assignment
8098086 mira woodcha all shut up he wants us to be quiet
8098087 and i need you to stop verbally abusing each other and i need you to stop using the words
8098088 a covenant is like a sacred promise like abraham he made one with god and sos did moses
8098089 very good yes a covenant is a sacred promise yahira
8098090 you niggas is so sorry mista yous all so dumb didnt none of you listen to nothin last year in miss jeans class
8098091 i am passing out to you a copy of a covenant i would like to propose for our class
8098092 i hate contract your grade classes i aint signin nothin
8098093 there is a huge difference between a contract and a covenant a contract is a legal thing it involves lawyers and if it is broken the contract dispute is settled in courts by judges and juries the penalty for breaking a contract is a fine or a lawsuit settlement or some such thing a covenant is different a sacred promise is something of the heart something of the soul if you break a covenant you damage a relationship you lose face you lose trust and you lose someones respect these penalties are much worse than paying a fine we need to make some promises to each other we all have to work together in this classroom this year we dont have to like one another but we do have to respect each other i propose a list of rights we should all have and a list of responsibilities we all need to live up to in order to ensure everyone enjoys their rights read it and lets discuss it if we need to add something we will if we need to take something out we will we can do nothing else until we unanimously agree to accept a covenant
8098094 its nice and all but it could be much shorter
8098095 well to my opinion the whole thing is about respect we could just make a covenant to respect each other
8098096 but the reason i proposed the other statements not just the one about respect is so we could describe a little bit what respect looks like as we work together every day in the classroom
8098097 what if i dont want to be making these promises
8098098 well james then we need to know why if there is something in this covenant you or anyone cannot agree to we must edit the covenant and come up with a set of promises we can all agree to make to each other is there any special reason why you dont want to make these promises
8098099 yeah how do i know everybodys gonna keep em how do i know youre gonna keep em
8098100 not one of us can guarantee we are never going to break these promises however if we all agree to try to keep them then when one of us including me breaks one of them someone can tell us that we promised not to do that if we all make a covenant with each other we are giving each other our word that we will keep it if someone breaks the covenant repeatedly they will have to ask themselves if their word is just a meaningless lie if we have all agreed to try and keep these promises and someone is breaking them all the time then we as a group have a legitimate request that the person breaking their promises all the time be moved into a different class that way if someone is causing real trouble it is not just the teacher or the school administration enforcing a disciplinary rule but our class taking action to maintain the environment we want in our classroom
8098101 you mean we get to kick each other out of class
8098102 we get to ask someone who repeatedly breaks their word with us to leave
8098103 what it gets down to john is that the religion class is what makes this school different yet its the hardest course to teach religion is the course the kids resist most
8098104 i think i can make religion more fun than algebra
8098105 look john we burn through religion teachers here in the archdiocese
8098106 whether you think so or not youre in for a tough start
8098107 i know everything bout jesus how hes the son of god and died for our sins and ifn you dont believe in him youre goin to hell
8098108 my dads a pastor and he knows the lord and teaches us all bout him i knows how it is
8098109 jesus loves me this i know cuz the bible tells me so i know jesus loves me mr c
8098110 thats easy mista come on yall knows its christmas on december 25th
8098111 and we only celebrate christmas on december 25th because thats the time of the year the romans used to celebrate the feast of the sun god that time of the year marks the seasonal turning point at the winter solstice the shortest day of the year and in the northern hemisphere anyway the days begin to get longer again the sun making more and more of an appearance each day when christianity became the official religion of the roman empire they started celebrating christmas at the same time of year to match up the old roman symbols with the new christian ones the sun in the sky coming more into the world and the son of god coming into the world get it
8098112 cuz christianity is a white racist religion trying to get niggas to worship a white man
8098113 then tell me why jesus didnt have any white disciples
8098114 what you talking about look at the pictures on your wall man
8098115 what does that prove was the guy who painted it an eye witness to the event was he working from a photograph somebody email him a jpeg come on korey think
8098116 well you ever wonder why all these pictures and paintings of jesus make him a white man with blonde hair and blue eyes
8098117 jesus looks white because these paintings and photos were done by white people these old paintings were done by guys from italy in the middle ages and the renaissance so not knowing what people from the middle east looked like or not caring about it they made everyone to look like themselves they were white europeans so they painted jesus as a white european jesus and his first followers were all middle eastern jews they looked more like yasar arafat then you or me
8098118 so why aint there pictures of jesus that look right
8098119 there are you just dont see them all the time people from different parts of the world make images of jesus to look like themselves
8098120 we gots a black jesus picture at my dads church
8098121 suit yourself but maybe ifn youd come to church youd be saved and wouldnt be doing the other stuff you do
8098122 saved from what i dont need no savin and if i did the only people be saving me are my boys you got to take care of yourself and you need someone to get your back i look out for me my boys got my back and thats all the saving i need
8098123 is seen you on calle i knows what you do
8098124 i dont know how you know mr c but since he was always doing jewish festivals and all in the gospels and he dont ever do no christian stuff they must have started the religion after him
8098125 im surprised you read the gospels from what youve been saying it doesnt seem like youd be interested
8098126 yeah the whole thing you think i cant read a book
8098127 just shit man just get back to your corny sunday school stuff all ight
8098128 no lets skip sunday school thats my point sunday school makes jesus all neat and clean and white and nice sunday school is jesus saying nice poetic things to his nice clean followers on a nice clean grassy hillside in perfect spring weather but that image of jesus is mostly bullshit
8098129 most roman soldiers would just as soon kill you as look at you some of his people wanted armed revolution against the romans to get them out of town he scared the romans and he scared the leaders of his own religion because of what he was saying he was seen as a rebel and those in power didnt like him because he made the powerless feel human and when the powerless feel empowered they rise up against whats putting them down and that was what the romans didnt want and that was what the religious leaders didnt want because they depended on the romans for their position and power
8098130 so how come no one ever tells us this stuff
8098131 i dont know why youve never heard it but i know that some people do teach this stuff the problem is that christianity is old and over the last 2 000 years jesus has been interpreted and reinterpreted over and over again religion is also political throughout history those in power in governments and those in power running religions have used their power to teach the versions of things they want people to believe in order to give the people a view of things that keeps them from resisting the powers that be its all about perception let me give you an example draw this puzzle on a piece of paper
8098132 what did you need to do to solve the puzzle korey
8098133 exactly you had to break the barrier you had stop seeing the puzzle as a square made out of dots and folks thats what you need to do in this class you need to open your minds and go outside the lines you need to put away what you think you know about jesus what you think a religion class is about and look at it all with fresh eyes and a new perspective you need to go outside the lines
8098134 god of goodness god of hope god of light god of longing god of love god of all send your most holy spirit down upon us as we gather in this most sacred place
8098135 we come before you and before each other to put our students before ourselves
8098136 we ask your help as we seek ways to touch the hearts of your children we thank you sweet lord for blessing us through the lives of our students help us to help them and each other we ask this in the name of jesus our friend and brother amen
8098137 if the cafeteria is serving chocolate cake for dessert it must be gods will i have chocolate cake
8098138 if its god will that i have hemorrhoids then i have hemorrhoids
8098139 he looks so scared sunshine because he is scared he is terrified actually
8098140 our students honey hes absolutely petrified of them he admits it himself
8098141 that he was so pitiful they made him campus minister just so he could stay but its hearsay ive never talked to him about that
8098142 why would he want to stay if hes afraid of the students
8098143 ive called the people from last year but they said they are booked the folks who run the freshman retreat arent interested because they are actually a junior high youth ministry and feel freshmen are their upper limit
8098144 john johnny john are you still with us earth to sunshine hello sunshine johnny sunshine hello are you still with us
8098145 would you like to run the sophomore retreat sunshine you do teach all the sophomores
8098146 is that a yes or a no my articulate harvard educated friend
8098147 because i havent been able to find anyone to run it nor have i been able to find a place to have it
8098148 it is usually in may with the other class retreats
8098149 sunshine if you are running it you can schedule it whenever you like now lets get to rosies item about the textbooks
8098150 that my daughter says she hasnt yet been issued a textbook for your class what do the kids think we ordered those books special just for you so that you would have a curriculum and not have to create one for yourself we tried to save you a lot of work i really think that we should all be on the same curriculum and golden is so nice especially their worksheets for each lesson annette doesnt seem to use them much either and i thought that if you two are not using them perhaps we could ask sister claire to come in and suggest a new text program
8098151 rosie i dont use the text much because i think the students dont like it
8098152 now if john doesnt want to use the books it probably has nothing to do with spite for your hard work in making sure he had a resource
8098153 all i see in the textbook is someone writing about the new testament
8098154 i figure that if i am teaching the new testament i dont want the students reading about the new testament i want them reading the new testament itself
8098155 no i just thought it was worth bringing to your attention annette
8098156 and you did so i thank you for that if we are done on textbooks lets get on to some scheduling items we should i think take turns at this monthly meeting with the following jobs leading opening prayer chairing the meeting and taking minutes
8098157 one of the perks of being headmaster is no one can write you up if you miss a meeting
8098158 one whit for the gospel of our lord and savior jesus christ
8098159 how many of you are wearing crosses and how many of you gave any serious thought to why you put on the cross some of you in fact probably chose the gold cross or the silver cross because it matched your blouse better than the other none of you i wager gave even the slighted pause for piety or prayer before donning the cross which you are wearing because it is jewelry first and because youre a christian second
8098160 who gives a crap really why the hell are we wasting our time on this bullshit you proved that being concerned about cornrows is pretty much racist if the kids want to style each others hair on their own lunch time youve got to ask yourself why anyone even gives a crap
8098161 its only the first week of october there are eight more of these to go breathe meditate pray
8098162 that is enough from you christopher youre as bad as the students
8098163 we wait our turn to speak here i will see you after the meeting
8098164 one headmaster martin has decided to explore a new school schedule using long blocks
8098165 five quizzes are the backbone of good teaching and every course should have quizzes weekly quizzes should count for at least 20 percent of the term grade thats all
8098166 excuse me sean but you cant tell me how to evaluate students
8098167 yes i can tell you how to evaluate them mr christopher i just did you would be smart to follow my directives
8098168 you may call me mister ogrady in front of the faculty assembled mr christopher
8098169 i know seans an asshole but that doesnt give you the right to be one as well i cant fire sean because the diocese has control over all administrative personnel i am not writing you up for this but i should the next time ogrady wants you warned im going to have to put something on file got it
8098170 and look sean is not the best principal in the world and god knows hes not terribly bright or creative but were stuck with him you on the other hand are too smart to let him win got that
8098171 and since you seem to be a good teacher and the kids seem to be responding to you i will cover your ass as much as i can but i cant cover it all the time got it
8098172 throw them up into the air and let them hit the ground
8098173 excellent i will make you all jugglers in no time
8098174 this is mad corny i aint doin this wack shit
8098175 mister c man im getting sick of this pretty fast
8098176 good that means youre ready to learn to juggle so that you dont have to keep picking the bags up off of the floor
8098177 mister c hows about we stop dropping these things and we dont learn how to juggle
8098178 ah thats a good question and i was hoping someone would ask it why do you think i am asking you to juggle anybody got a good answer
8098179 man can you just tell us this one time aint no one in here got a freakin clue about why were jugglin
8098180 this is sophomore religion mister c new testament or whatever
8098181 and thats the answer were jugglin cuz this is religion class
8098182 but what does juggling have to do with religion or the new testament or jesus
8098183 we have no idea mister christopher please just tell us
8098184 yes in order to learn how to juggle i had to juggle a lot i had to practice the way to become better at anything is to practice this class will study the new testament and the teachings of jesus much of jesus teaching is about moral matters morality is about being good or evil trying to do what is right and avoid doing what is wrong morality is about becoming a better person and the only way to become a better person is to practice juggling is a living analogy to this course if you want to be a just person a person who treats others fairly and gives them what they deserve then you must practice justice if you want to be an honest person you must practice honesty if you want to be a loyal person you must practice loyalty if you want to be a loving person you must practice loving every time you act in a certain way you become the type of person that acts in that way it becomes easier and easier to act in that way in a very real sense the way to become a better person is to practice every time you make a decision every time you act in a certain way you are molding your character building your inner self you are what you do and you do what you are
8098185 which of these things on the board are moral decisions or actions and which are not
8098186 having sex with my girl is jus fine mista c
8098187 it may feel good but whether it is the right or wrong thing for you to do is another matter yes no
8098188 well mister christopher most of em are moral stuff the ones that arent are buying clothes where you eat and exercising
8098189 what do you mean mista i mean really what the heck is moral about what you eat or exercising and how can buying clothes at gap or old navy or salvation army or wal mart be right or wrong or whatever seriously mister christopher you overpaid for your big college education
8098190 i see but if i may explain my disagreement counselor you may be swayed
8098191 every single decision a person makes and every single act a person commits is a moral one everything is morality every thing you do and decide makes you into a certain type of person and helps determine how you will act or choose in the future some things are small matters of morality and others more serious maybe but all things are moral what you eat tells us what kind of person you are are you a person who cares what they eat whether you eat healthy food whether you eat food produced and served in a way that doesnt oppress a labor force or harm the environment what clothes you buy matters do you want to buy clothes that are made by slave labor in sweatshops by children in third world countries or by illegal immigrants in the us who cant even turn in their crooked employers for fear of being deported do you think it important to take care of yourself by eating right getting enough sleep and exercising its all moral matter and it all matters think about it
8098192 in the hall for a private word on the double
8098193 i am in the middle of teaching a class right now
8098194 from what i hear christopher you are running recess or a toddlers birthday but youre not doing any teaching at all
8098195 its ok mr c but i told you so you know
8098196 i know you did skinny but i dont give up so easily lets keep working on it when were ready well record you and ill play the stuff for mr martin i think hell overrule ogrady ok
8098197 im being called to the principals office again i assume
8098198 no you dont eunice is taking care of it were going to go and meet annette and sean in my office
8098199 this insubordinate degenerate will not teach again in this institution not that he has been teaching
8098200 look sean i dont approve of what john did but i am the headmaster and all of you need to understand that is that clear john sean annette
8098201 look everybody have a seat and let me see if i have the story straight this way i can make sure we are all on the same page first rosie went to sean and said that john was showing the kids how to juggle and complained that juggling was not in the curriculum sean told her hed check it out and went to johns room sean asked john to step out into the hall and john shut the door in his face hows that are we all on the same page
8098202 there are some important details you left out the most important is that sean did not simply ask johnny sunshine to step out into the hall he ordered him into the hall with that abusive yell of his i heard him next door as if he were yelling in my own face
8098203 i used the appropriate tone one needs to take with ones underlings especially a first year teacher in the building and it is no laughing matter that he is wasting instructional time with juggling these kids will not learn their catechism by watching mr christophers circus act they can only learn it if it is taught to them properly these are the least of his offenses he shut the door on me david
8098204 he held the door against me david i will not stand for it
8098205 if you raise your voice like that in my presence again i am leaving leaving this room leaving this school and leaving this job
8098206 sean you may be right to be angry at johnny for shutting the door on you in front of the students but you yelled at him in front of his students
8098207 and thats why i kept you out of my room
8098208 whatever problem you have with johnny you talk to him about it talk not yell out of ear shot of the students as for the juggling if you have a problem with what is being taught in the theology classes you can talk talk not yell to me i am the department chair and those issues should be brought to me
8098209 miss jean you mean well i am sure but you do not quite understand the seriousness of the offense here
8098210 mr christopher is undermining my authority over these children by treating me like this in front of them
8098211 are you doing to him by yelling at him in front of the students as if he were just another student himself and not a highly educated and well trained theologian and experienced classroom teacher i will tell you what you are doing mr ogrady you are telling the students that they need not respect the teacher because you do not you may also call me ms jean for i find the title miss offensive i am not a young maiden nor am i any less of a person because i am not married
8098212 david surely you will not let the matter rest at that
8098213 well look no i have some more to say to both of you john you are never to shut the door on any administrator or fellow teacher in this school ever again nor are you to hold a door shut or impede the legitimate movement of any staff person ever again i will write a letter of incident and go over it with you you will sign it and may make any written statement you want to go in your file alongside it this will count as a written verbal warning for insubordination according to your union contract is that clear
8098214 pay attention to what is being said and quiet down as for you you will not address any teacher in this school with an inappropriate tone of voice you will most certainly not yell at them annette is right you will go through proper channels about curriculum and you will speak in a civil manner to my staff is that clear
8098215 mr christopher may do anything he wishes as far as instructional methodology goes in as much as he acts within legal boundaries and conducts himself as a professional educator when he interviewed for this job he juggled eunice thought the kids would love it i believe correct me if im wrong john that you said you do the juggling bit in class to teach the kids that just as you need to practice in order to learn how to juggle you need to practice being a good person is that correct john
8098216 well then after todays incident i think both of you could use some practice
8098217 wouldnt that be nice she fucking freaks me out the crazy bitch
8098218 royale do you feel all right do you need to go to the nurse
8098219 im ok mister christopher im just really sleepy thats all my mom made me go shopping clean the apartment and visit uncle pete last night then i had to meet her at work and help her finish i didnt get to sleep until 3 a m
8098220 royale you cant be doing that stuff why dont you go see sister eunice
8098221 you know my policy its either that or the nurse no sleeping in class
8098222 mister christopher it wasnt so bad but she woke me up again at 4 30 cuz i missed a spot washing the kitchen floor
8098223 royale your mom shouldnt be keeping you up at night like that whats going on
8098224 shes been going on about dat wack shit since she got here last year
8098225 you dont know shit you dont know shit about royale you dont know shit about nothin
8098226 cmon royale you and me and are going to see mr martin
8098227 shes fifteen going on nine she comes to school in pink dresses with her straightened hair in pigtails for gods sake shes asleep in class half the time and when shes awake simple directions never mind simple concepts fly right over her head every single kid in the school gives her shit what the hell is going on with her
8098228 fix it no shit john thats what were trying to do but we just cant order her out of her home right now st somebody is the only home shes got she wont talk to most of her teachers she talks to eileen quinn and eileen is waiting and listening for anything new we can use to get her help from what youre saying she seems to say stuff to you at least she talks in class pay attention and see what you can learn the poor girl doesnt even talk to her other teachers mrs delguidace has had the girl since shes been here all last year and this year and the child hasnt yet said one word to the woman not one word betty del does not exaggerate for effect the child has not spoken once in the womans class sometimes you cant help them all john you know that
8098229 look its good you know it feels like shit but its good this is a tough job when youve got a caring heart but if you dont have a caring heart you shouldnt do this job
8098230 im ok mister christopher youre a nice man you and miss quinn shes a nice man too i mean a nice lady too i wish i had you and her for all my classes maybe if i ask mr ogrady hed let me have you
8098231 well royale i dont teach much math or history so i guess its just new testament for now
8098232 sometimes crying is good you feel better after it but sometimes you cry and still feel awful no matter how much you cry do you think it helps to cry mister christopher momma says crying dont help nothin so stop it
8098233 i think crying is necessary royale weve got to let our emotions out or they get stuck up inside us and make us feel even worse but i dont know if crying helps us solve whats bothering us i think we need to do that in different ways if just crying alone solved our problems id start crying right now heck kiddo id cry all the time
8098234 great were up 32 0 this team is horrible we should score 100 today even with the second string hell the third string and get a load of this field if there wasnt some grass here and there they might as well be playing in a parking lot
8098235 yeah mista we got a coach but she dont come on saturdays shes a cheerleader at northeastern and she can only come to friday night games but we only play three fridays she cant come saturdays because she cheers for northeastern games on saturdays

8098243 hey coach why dont you put in the second string heck why dont you put in the freshman

8098245 why dont you just put in some subs coach its obvious youre the better team
8098246 you just tell your coach to take a knee on offense and stop trying to score and ill send in my subs to do the same as long he tries to score i try to stop him and as long as he tries to stop me i try to score now get outta here and go back to your ghetto boys you sorry ass prick
8098247 mom says i cant juggle anymore because its got nothing to do with learning the teachings of the church and its disrespectful to pretend that its a form of prayer
8098248 you know my mom she can be so mean i dont know how anyone who goes to church as much as mom can be so mean why is she so mean mr christopher she knows i like juggling how come everything i like is wrong or sinful or disrespectful i do everything she wants me to do i get good grades i go to church i joined the cyc everything but as soon as i like something thats not church its always wrong and i have to stop why
8098249 youre mom wants you to stop juggling because she doesnt think its an appropriate assignment right
8098250 well angela i dont think she has a problem with you i think she has a problem with me she doesnt think i should be teaching juggling but mr martin and ms jean say its ok so whats she do she cant stop me from teaching it so shes gonna stop you from learning it shes using you to get back at me why dont you tell her that and tell her youll fail religion if you dont juggle

8098254 look john you might have been better off calling this meeting yourself instead of writing that letter rosies the only person who doesnt understand shes taking out her dislike of your methods on her daughter but her little angel is the one whos going to pay the price in the end not you got that

8098352 mr c the cops arrested us for walking to school
8098353 officer rose sir these young men were picked up for disorderly conduct on terrence street they claim to go to school here so were just checking that out and calling their parents do you know them
8098354 hell yes i know them theyre my students what were they doing
8098355 they were shouting obscenities at residents banging on car hoods and pounding on doors along a stretch of terrence street
8098356 its a lie mr c we didnt do nothing we were just walking to school
8098357 look john you might as well just stay here i have sister eunice covering your classes this morning after i deal with this mess omayra pabon is coming in and we are going to meet about the results of my investigation i dont know if her boyfriend mr martinez is coming with her or not but you need to be here wait in eunices office
8098358 hanging around nothing to do but frown rainy days and mondays always get me down
8098359 be with me lord when i am in trouble be with me lord i pray
8098360 look folks things are already crazy here this morning so lets get to it ok
8098361 during a parents night conference miss pabon accused john christopher teacher in the theology department of being sexually involved with her daughter
8098362 se or my brother neron is a priest and he suggested we come to you first and report to the bishop first before going to the police
8098363 thank you mr martinez if i may finish mr christopher reported that you used inappropriate language in accusing him and both threatened him with physical violence and attempted to hit him i encouraged him to file a report with me and with the police if he felt that it was in order
8098364 as to the first part the alleged sexual relationship between mr christopher and yahira jiminez i give you my report i interviewed mr christopher at length and he categorically denied ever having treated yahira wrongly in anyway i interviewed yahira her friends here at school and other students who have mr christopher for a teacher i interviewed his department chair and some other faculty members i interviewed the school guidance counselors and the visiting therapist from the catholic charitable foundation to inquire if there have ever been any reports of misconduct by mr christopher i have spoken with all of his previous employers and his pastor from his parish in bethelle after speaking with these people i am convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt that mr christopher has never touched spoken to or spoken about or even looked at yahira jiminez in any way shape or form that is either illegal or unprofessional in fact yahira herself said he has never done anything inappropriate to her and he is one of the only teachers here who doesnt even check her out his students almost unanimously say he is their favorite teacher and would trust him with anything yahiras three closest friends seem to love mr christopher as a teacher and know yahira says he is her favorite no faculty or staff even those who dislike him personally do not believe he would ever do such a thing the guidance counselors and therapist report nothing of concern his former employers report no incidents of any kind of inappropriate behavior toward students the position of this school is that mr christopher is innocent and he will not be disciplined by the school i have shared all of this information with the archdiocese in fact they helped me gather some of it and the archdiocese of boston believes he is innocent and no action should be taken against him
8098365 that cant be i know she is fucking him shes a little whore shes going to hell
8098366 look guy one more outburst like that and youll be taken off the school grounds
8098367 i find it completely unacceptable for my teachers to be attacked by parents or guardians or their partners so i am asking you never to set foot in the school again mr martinez should you show up here i will call the police and mr christopher will file assault charges against you with the full support of this school and the archdiocese of boston
8098368 look miss pabon i highly recommend that you let our school therapist work with yahira something is going on and its not good and it has nothing to do with mr christopher your daughter is bright but shes angry and hostile her friends say she cries a lot somethings up and its up at home not here you can take this matter to the police if you want but ive dealt with teachers behaving inappropriately with students before and we dont have that going on here
8098369 i will give a written copy of this report to all of you in the next day or two this meeting is over
8098370 i dont know john it seems that a guy on terrence street called the police because they were being very loud walking down the street banging on cars and knocking on doors and running the kids say some guy leaned out of a window and yelled at them asking what the hell they were doing they said walking to school and the guy started calling them niggers and all kinds of stuff the kids got mad and ran up to his building and started knocking on the door for him to come down the police came and saw the kids banging on the hood of a car in front of the building and yelling the police said when they pulled up the boys calmed down pretty quickly and claimed to be walking to school the officers took a report from the guy on terrence street but he was belligerent so they figured the kids story was a more accurate version of events there was no damage to the car or the building so the officers called in and we confirmed the boys went to school here the police brought them here to call their parents
8098371 racial profiling by the neighbors cool what a wonderful day in the neighborhood eh dave
8098372 just about john happens a lot though last year antawan was brought in by the police themselves for walking through south hancock early in the morning they didnt believe he was a student on his way to school maybe i should make them wear uniforms after all
8098373 oh sorry i cussed mr c but he broke my nail
8098374 lydia hon youve got to go to the nurse youre hand is puffing up like a balloon im sorry you broke a nail your nails are a work of art

8098382 but you said we could bring in the music for the game
8098383 yes i did and we listened to everything you wanted to in the first game my choice for this game
8098384 come on vo you can sit on my lap janet let lydia sit on your lap come on
8098385 i am not sitting on no dudes lap mr c

8098389 i cant mista all the laps left are guys i aint sittin on no guys lap i just cant mista im out i cant do it i aint no faggot
8098390 whoa first of all sitting on someones lap has absolutely no bearing nor makes any indication about ones sexual orientation second you know i hate homophobic remarks and language you speak as if being gay was a crime or somehow made you less than human if you want out of the game get out but dont let it be because youre too afraid that someone might think less of you because they might think you are gay got it
8098391 raul is too macho for us today lets get back to it raul if you dont play you cant win
8098392 sallright mista no one is winning this game anyway its another one of your trick games
8098393 folks theres one more round to go take the chair away and line up one more time
8098394 you see you folks got to figure out how to sit everyone legally it can be done but if you want to win youve got to get everyone seated within one minute after the music stops
8098395 raul is right no one wins what does it matter
8098396 yo mira listen we all win we all win isnt that right mista
8098397 we all get a box of candy and 18 points
8098398 no you all get to share a box of candy and 18 points
8098399 you all havent won it yet you still have one round to go and sixty seconds to seat yourselves
8098400 i got it i got it everybody line up face the same way
8098401 times up you all lose you want another crack at it
8098402 if i got to sit too we need to circle up we do what we did last time but this time in a circle
8098403 to show us that we need to work together mista
8098404 true enough but theres more to it think about the two games what was the first game like what was the prize how did you win what skills helped a person to do well in game one
8098405 every man for himself dog eat dog no one got your back survival of the fittest
8098406 the prize was hefty everyone wanted them points you won by being last man standing you did good if you were strong and fast and aggressive
8098407 yes yes youre all right on and what about the second game
8098408 in the second game mista you was trying to show us to work as a team that we can all win if we work together we dont always have to be fighting each other
8098409 thats right yahira nice job but why this game with these analogies in a new testament class
8098410 cuz the way of the lord is like the second game but the way of the world is like the first game
8098411 whose rules am i playing by you decide your world your rules how you gonna play amen
8098412 mama says i have to see the counselor lady at school
8098413 kiddo going to counseling isnt just for people who are severely mentally ill almost everyone could use it at one time or another i hear the counselor who comes here from the catholic charitable foundation is pretty good you would be surprised at how many students kids you know see her
8098414 i dont know mista i dont know the lady maybe i can just talk to you instead
8098415 ill talk to you anytime yahira but there are people who believe it or not are actually better counselors than i am im a teacher but a trained professional therapist is the person to go to for counseling let you in on a secret though
8098416 you do but youre so cool whats wrong with you
8098417 listen kiddo when i was your age my issues had issues i was angry and depressed although they didnt diagnose it as depression then and today well im a teacher i deal with other peoples issues and stress for a living every day and then theres the things that i cant and shouldnt tell you about so i have plenty of reason to go i go once a month if counseling can help someone as nearly perfect as myself i smiled she giggled then it couldnt hurt for you to try
8098418 first up is rosies item input from other faculty about our department
8098419 thank you mr christopher it seems that mrs doyle is getting a lot of complaints that her u s history class is not like the sophomore religion class and therefore stinks although she says the students have been using worse language to describe it one of them last week told her that her class lord and those present forgive me sucks
8098420 it seems that both she and mr greene have been being chastised by their students for doing old fashioned teaching
8098421 that students are openly criticizing them for not being like mr christopher
8098422 and so what who cares when is the important part coming
8098423 i do not believe it is the job of the religion department to criticize other teachers in front of the students we are all catechists even the math teachers and as such we are all equal workers in the fields of the lord the last thing we should do is criticize our fellow laborers in the vineyard
8098424 sunshine you didnt criticize other teachers in front of the kids did you
8098425 you didnt really tell mon onc gerard he was a stupid alcoholic canuck truck driver did you
8098426 gerard time to quit the wheel and hit that aa meeting
8098427 no annette i did not criticize any teacher in front of my students i do talk about why i teach the way i do and why i think lecturing and worksheets are inferior i talk with the students about different models and methods of teaching and learning if they are making connections to what they are experiencing in other classrooms then good for them theyre gaining control of their own experiences and their own lives and if what i do works for them better than what theyre getting in their other classes i cant be blamed that some people feel inferior or have had their feelings hurt because my success makes their mediocrity stand out
8098428 so you admit it you think yourself better than the rest of us
8098429 i think there are ways we can all do better for our students and i try my best to work in those ways i think lecturing kids doesnt work i think rote memorization doesnt work and i think busy work is a crime if my students like my activities my conferences and my projects better than greenes memorization of prepositions or doyles reading to them from her textbook i make no apologies for my success in reaching them
8098430 who gave you the right to judge me mr christopher who tell me who i know god does not judge me so why should you
8098431 i thought this was about me and greene and doyle if you see yourself in them far be it for me to correct your self assessment but i never mentioned you maybe this isnt about greene and doyle maybe its about you and if it is about you why didnt you have the guts to be real from the get go
8098432 enough johnny rosie if you have a problem with johnny be up front i am not going to let this meeting turn into an argument if johnny isnt naming teachers in particular or in general but only explaining his methods to the kids thats fine by me if you want to take it up with sean rosie go ahead
8098433 is my proposal to inculturate the school liturgies by using contemporary urban music and dance
8098434 mr ogrady already said that will not be allowed so we do not need to discuss it
8098435 i dont think it was right of sean to dismiss the idea without a discussion but i tend to agree with him that the music kids listen to today is not appropriate music for church
8098436 but ernie any musical style can be sacred music if the kids rap who cares as long as they are rapping about god there are christian bands and groups doing every style of music from rap to a cappella jazz vocal to grunge rock
8098437 just because people are doing it doesnt make it ok john people have abortions too but are you going to tell the kids thats ok
8098438 besides i would be willing to put together the whole thing
8098439 and i am quite undecided still perhaps we could discuss it next time and i will pray over the matter until that time
8098440 my proposal to train students as lectors and eucharistic ministers i think we could get more student interest and more participation if we included them more in the liturgies we could ask for volunteers and recruit kids we know would do well and brother ernie could instruct these kids during study period or something
8098441 i couldnt do that john i wouldnt feel comfortable working with the kids on those things
8098442 im sorry brother you are the campus minister arent you
8098443 right sorry if you are uncomfortable i could do it after school
8098444 student lectors and extraordinary ministers of the eucharist are out of the question those are ministries reserved for confirmed adults who attend diocesan sanctioned preparation and formation programs for those ministries we can not just dispense with the rules of the church as we see fit
8098445 in case you missed it rosie jesus broke the rules too especially when the spiritual life of the people was at stake
8098446 if it ever gets to that point lets just let john do it
8098447 besides johnny sunshine when ernie said he would pray over it thats good sign thats ernies way of coming around to something i bet hell go along with it by the end of the year let him have his space hes trying to give some to you
8098448 i say so besides theres more to ernest than you know and its not my place to tell trust me
8098449 who is this leon is he the transfer from roarke high in dorchester hes the husky boy right hes not the one with the braids and earrings is he does my angel sit with him im not sure i want you to let her work too closely with this leon in class john
8098450 i think angela is interested in this leon boy john the name leon is written all over her notebook
8098451 uh rosie shes fifteen girls her age write names of boys they like or boys theyre dating on their notebooks
8098452 you will see scattered around you 36 in play money each dollar is one bonus point on your grade grab as many as you can go
8098453 the folks with the cash should come line up at my computer and ill log your bonus points in my grade book

8098459 stop it royale is right and dont call her cinderella or you deal with me whats up with a world where weve been convinced were all set against each other royale is right on remember musical chairs you guys forgot already what kind of world do you wanna make
8098460 kill that kid no mista i didnt but i was there i swear i didnt you believe me
8098461 yes i believe you korey but if you didnt do it why are you hiding or who are you hiding
8098462 big t was the one busted a cap in the kids ass mr c i aint hiding nobody
8098463 you can you just dont want to your greek letter why did you write it diatribe ill tell you you wrote it because you wanted help with your situation but were afraid to come out and ask why are you here now same reason and i cant help you if you wont be straight with me shoot straight k c rip or get the hell outta here
8098464 you wont tell anybody all that confidentiality and stuff right
8098465 korey confidentiality applies to class and projects but and this is a huge but confidentiality goes out the window when your life or health is in danger you are wanted by the police for questioning korey i have to tell or im a criminal too you know that thats why youre here
8098466 the only way i can help you is to clear your name i believe you didnt help big t kill that boy but i also believe you know who did i think youre protecting them and protecting them is hurting you
8098467 you dont get it mr c if i dont tell the cops are on me but if i do tell the rayzas are on me its a lose lose situation

8098480 how can i calm down john you probably already told him he could stay with us now youre going to have to tell him he cant and as much as i hate the idea its worse because you probably didnt think about what it would be like to have to renege on the kid thats going to hurt you as well as him and i have to live with you and your updates on what happened to him youll make all kinds of comments about how much better it would be for him if he had been with us you werent fair to me or him or yourself
8098481 marie i didnt already tell him he could stay with us besides the state would have to approve it anyway i just told him i would ask you
8098482 can you believe it mom he wants us to adopt a black kid from boston a kid whos been selling drugs yet
8098483 besides you dont want a black teenager around your kids do you
8098484 its just those kids that kid whatever would be so different what would people say
8098485 i dont give a shit what people would say ron they can say what they want my only concern would be for the kid
8098486 anyone who would care can go jump in a lake
8098487 i am john make no mistake about it i am against as in not in favor of this idea however anyone who would say anything about it because hes black can jump you know
8098488 well if you ask me marie it doesnt seem crazy at all
8098489 isnt it the type of thing youre always doing go be a nurse work in a free clinic go to africa and help the sick natives marry a teacher
8098490 and not a doctor like you think a nurse would
8098491 but pep its different we have a small house barely enough room for the four of us and its not just food and clothes and all it would be doctors visits counseling visits parole visits visits with the youth services agency and tons of paperwork its not that im against the idea of it but were just not at a place in our lives now where we can do it
8098492 oui joseph we have room all the kids are gone celine is home so little you are getting ready to retire and i only work part time
8098493 you could do it it would be strange it might not work a teenager moving in with foster grandparents but we could help
8098494 i dont know either joseph but we have raised seven children and all of them are fine people how much different can it be now than it was for celine or even marie eat your vegetables brush your teeth do your chores turn down the loud music go to church go to cyc no staying out late do your homework
8098495 go to your counseling session visit your parole officer come with us to the meeting with the social worker
8098496 it seems god has brought someone in need to our door we should not shut the door lets at least find out what would be involved
8098497 korey doesnt go to church and even if he did hes not catholic
8098498 well hell go to church if he lives in this house
8098499 how do we find out whats involved to be foster parents john
8098500 i dont know exactly mum but you have to be approved by the state ill call moira and debbie hammer and find out
8098501 why are those boys still here they misbehave in class they barely pass their courses and now they are making enemies of our neighbors in south hancock by breaking car windows and threatening members of the community with violence
8098502 they dress like gangsters with their hair in those cornrows and that jeremiah is the worst offender when it comes to wearing our lords cross as jewelry have you seen the size of the thing he wears around his neck its like a chain collar for a bear
8098503 and esteemed colleagues i gave a quiz on homonyms and not one student passed jeremiah did not answer one item correctly as an example for the set of two too and to he wrote i went t o o mcdonalds and asked the lady for t o big macs and i asked for them t w o go can you believe it when he received his grade he frowned in disbelieve and at the end of class he approached me and said i want to axe you about my grade why is it that they pronounce the word ask if it were the word for hatchet
8098504 he should get ready to work at mcdonalds the hulking ignoramus
8098505 and what about that korey constant a murderer i just knew it hes so vile good riddance to bad rubbish i suppose were lucky he didnt kill one of us
8098506 excuse me henry bernice those guys behave perfectly well in my class none of them is worse than a c student although they have their share of poor grades and most importantly they were victims of racial profiling and were guilty of nothing but walking to school
8098507 you who gave me a lecture about criticizing the faculty in front of the kids should stop slandering the kids in front of other teachers and korey is not guilty hes in custody but will probably be released soon after his hearing all of you should give up on the gossip and bigotry
8098508 we know you think youre cool the student advocate the kids best buddy but our job is not to be friends with these kids surely you realize we are dealing with the next generation of criminals on the streets of boston here
8098509 what i realize henry is that too many people on this staff have attitudes about our students based on stereotypes of young urban minority groups
8098510 im not your friend henry and dont be so unoriginal
8098511 she called you a pervert that little hussy has some nerve someone should give her a spanking and slap across the face if she had a mother worth speaking of maybe she wouldnt be such a brat but her mom was just as bad remember
8098512 indeed i miss the days of corporal punishment in the classroom sometimes
8098513 she should be sent home for wearing that skirt and top you can see almost see up the young things crotch for gods sake and that frilly low cut blouse leaves nothing to the imagination
8098514 she flaunts herself around here and has the gall to go on about her womens lib crap and latina power and such nonsense
8098515 its all right sal shell get what she deserves shell be picking up business on the street by the time shes 20 probably get the aids and die and rid us of her filthy presence
8098516 and guess who she was dancing with in the hall today
8098517 it was that boy called skinny and william mcintosh that tall senior from southie
8098518 it was disgusting they were grinding into each other at the crotch it was horrible they were simulating intercourse it was an offense to any decent persons sensibility
8098519 we should kick that little tease out of here along with her latina buddies
8098520 ive got to go ernie im gonna end up misbehaving if i stay and eat here
8098521 im going down to the cafeteria to eat lunch with yahira and jeremiah and skinny
8098522 if you all hate these kids so much why on earth are you teachers do something else with your lives youre thats y o u r e miserable you know that
8098523 oh come on john youre just upset that were picking on your girlfriend yahira
8098524 so they dont want you going out of town huh
8098525 yeah but my moms is in jail you know where the hell am i gonna go mr c
8098526 dunno kiddo but ms kelly is working on it right
8098527 yeah but you know she says the court is afraid if they let me be placed out in the suburbs ill skip parole meetings and take off my dad has already started some shit and says he wants custody but the court told him to get serious i dont know man maybe im just better off here
8098528 excuse my language but are you fucking crazy you want to stay in this jail instead of being in a nice home away from the city with some incredibly nice people who will do anything for you if you do want this place here instead of that youre nuts you dont need lock up you need the nut house
8098529 but mr c living with a couple of old white folks in an old white town thats gonna be real fun
8098530 no being a teacher and all i probably shouldnt say this in this way but i will and if you ever tell anybody i said this to you in this way i will deny it to my death and i guarantee anyone concerned takes my word over yours the system being age biased and racist and all
8098531 stop fucking up korey youre not a criminal and dont want to be so stop pretending you have to be get your goddamn ass in gear before its too late and you convince me and moira kelly and the cormiers that youre not worth the effort youre smart for gods sake you read books like theyre going out of style but for some reason you think you need to hide that from folks you wrote the best ancient greek letter ive ever had on that assignment shit youre the only one who understood it think about it a bunch of suburban white folks are ready to be the best friends youve ever had dont look at me like that your friends are worth crap the rayzas may have saved your ass from one beating in grade school but now youre just as afraid of them as you are of anything or anyone else they dont give a shit about you youre replaceable to me and ms kelly and my wifes parents youre a child of god dont be a stupid prick korey let us help
8098532 i know now would you start behaving like someone who wants to get out of here instead of confirming for everyone that you are someone who belongs locked up
8098533 just hang in there and dont fuck up until we find out whats gonna happen
8098534 no you win korey me i lose im stuck hearing it from my in laws every time you fuck up
8098535 im telling your wife you say fuck all the time
8098536 but mr c hes stealing from the bank hes in jail
8098537 well what do you expect from someone with nothing in his pockets and no prospects of getting anything anytime soon
8098538 i expect for him to go the south hancock house with the other bums and street people
8098539 progress is not moving fast enough for me i need instant gratification
8098540 ah but johnny you are such a clich the impatient american male its good news johnny moira says that she contacted the massachusetts foster parents association and they will help push koreys request to be placed with the cormiers and to have the process expedited there is some concern over your in laws not being american citizens but moiras working on calming those fears she has completed the application for a family home license for the cormiers and gotten permission from them for a criminal records inquiry a licensure officer is going out from the mass youth services agency tomorrow to investigate the family stability and inspect the home we may be talking a matter of weeks before we get an answer but its better than the usual waiting period which is months the best news of all is that due to the special circumstances mysa is allowing your in laws to take the training course over the next two weeks while the other stuff is in process that is a major exception they are making for us be patient sunshine it will be ok
8098541 my god and my lover tell me so sunshine my god and my lover tell me so
8098542 well have to have monsignor read the gospel and preach we just cant break the rules whenever we want to we could get into serious trouble
8098543 theres an old russian folk tale that says on christmas eves that are clear and cold and bright the holy family comes back to earth just like the first christmas they look for a deserted cave and wait for the miraculous birth the shepherds come back with them and so do the twelve wise men
8098544 no dolores in russia because they are eastern orthodox christians their tradition is of twelve
8098545 exactly anyway the wise men bring with them their whole crowd their camels their families their servants and their guards everything they also bring their gifts to give to the baby
8098546 yes do and nine other ones as well i suppose then they all sit around mary and joseph and the baby and wait
8098547 they are waiting for people of faith to find them
8098548 well first of all in order to find them a person has to be searching for them seeking out how christ can be in their life and when a person does find them mary beckons them to come look at the christ child
8098549 and when a person of faith looks on the christ child they discover a miracle when they look down at the baby they see the babys face is their own face
8098550 you see jesus isnt gods only beloved child so are you you are gods beloved child dont ever forget that dont ever let anyone make you think or believe it isnt so christ lives in you and you in him
8098551 yeah dave the girls a mess and her friends are upset and the last thing they need right now is sean or eunice
8098552 you are captain just trying to make you look good again
8098553 all right look ill take a stroll see what i turn up
8098554 dont know john mrs solomon just got here about five minutes ago yahiras been sitting in that chair since mrs white and i brought her up from the basement well i take that back she did get up once when i tried to talk to her she got up snatched the tape dispenser off the corner of my desk and threw it at my head ive been waiting here out of range for mrs solomon look weve been waiting to find out whats going on with yahira for a while now ill bet this is where we start to get some answers
8098555 look john neither of us can do much right this minute so im going to eunices office to get some things done while we wait for mrs solomon to finish with yahira you should not waste your lunch time here when theyre done in there ill call yahiras mom ill let you know what happens
8098556 look john when omayra pabon came to pick up yahira she said that she was filing charges against you for molesting the girl
8098557 right anyway look yahira talked to mrs solomon for almost three hours and from what she tells me she heard from yahira the charges if they are brought will be thrown out
8098558 because the girl is being molested possibly raped but not by you
8098559 thanks dave but i know that is it her moms boyfriend
8098560 lourdes wouldnt say but she called youth services and they sent a social worker over the social worker went home with yahira and her mom they are investigating lourdes called in a catholic charitable foundation lawyer from their legal aid office ill call you at home if theres any news by tonight
8098561 i want you to always be safe and surrounded by love baby girl just want you to be safe come on lets get you into bed

8098564 this young man says he is not a canadiens fan not only that he doesnt like hockey ive already told him there will be no basketball watching on my tv this is a hockey house
8098565 ah the old man will let you watch ball korey as long as the canadiens arent on
8098566 well my skin is just the way it is too
8098567 were going to lancaster hill they let you sled there
8098568 i know hes never been seen with white people before
8098569 i built this house with my own hands this is my house and it is a catholic house you will not talk like that you listen to me you say that again and i hear it you are going back to jail or wherever they had you locked up
8098570 dont be sorry with me just keep your mouth clean
8098571 pep hasnt lost a bit of dad wrath since i was that age youd think hed maybe be a bit out of practice but not pep
8098572 ok ok i wont do it again lets go sledding
8098573 you will ask permission to leave this house every time you want to go somewhere just like our own kids did
8098574 i am not old i am fifty nine but i am serious i am the father of this house you want to go out you ask missus or myself first understand
8098575 when the little ones get tired probably about an hour or so
8098576 if you make it all the way down the hill roll out before you hit the stone wall
8098577 youre staying on the sofa until we decide if we want to keep you
8098578 the bedrooms are upstairs you can pick which one you want we had all girls except for ives so i suppose you wont like the d cor you can change the wallpaper and curtains if you want
8098579 can i just stay here now do i have to wait until monday
8098580 mr c this aint gonna be cool no music im gonna go crazy
8098581 well then chill and deal joseph cormier is old fashioned not even old school just old and not in touch with your world this doesnt make him a bad guy though look at it from his perspective he agrees to take a young black kid from boston into his home a kid with whom he shares almost nothing not a generation not a culture not a language not a set of experiences he takes this kid in mostly because his wife thinks it a very holy and nice thing to do and the kid swears worse than the truck drivers he works with and goes around with headphones on mumbling songs about killing people and bitches and whores and muthafuckers hes just as nervous about you being here as you are
8098582 well is he going to keep sending me to my room like im a little kid
8098583 you are a little kid man to him you are a little kid he raised seven children on a truck drivers salary five of them are married one works in town one is in college half of them have kids of their own and all of them are employed and or making their own way nicely through life none of them has ever been arrested or involved in a gang or anything the way he sees it hes done his job as a father and done it well and frankly i cant disagree with him can you
8098584 no but damn everythings so fucked up im just pissed off all the time i just want to break down the walls whenever im inside and whenever i go outside i feel like i just want to run until my legs give out
8098585 youre right korey i dont know exactly im a white guy who lives in the suburbs teaching a bunch of urban students who are black asian and latino i dont know what its like to be my students to face the world you all face im amazed my students even listen to me but i grew up in a city new bedford and ive been to africa and europe and canada and im human and my dad was a drunk and my lifes had its share of fucked up uh messed up so i kinda know in general
8098586 i thought you french people only did one gift on christmas eve
8098587 just thought you know a guy cant be without his music
8098588 just tell joseph its a computer thing for school or something he doesnt know anything about computers and if you tell him i gave it to you ill deny it especially if hes pissed over it
8098589 no man you aint teaching class answer the question do you believe she was virgin
8098590 i dont know honestly i dont think it makes a difference
8098591 because whats important to me is what jesus said and did not whether his birth was miraculous
8098592 but isnt the miraculous what makes it so special john
8098593 i mean if jesus is just another cool peace nik like gandhi or something then wheres the holiness the shit i dont know the special ness of it all
8098594 why does it need to be supernatural to be special celine to make us feel better to make us feel safe because things can be such a mess i really dont think its important
8098595 because its shit like that that makes it hard to believe the rest of the stuff
8098596 you know like blessed are the peacemakers do unto others that stuff
8098597 i know did you see the people at church tonight korey
8098598 no korey i dont mean did you see them with your eyes i mean did you really look at them because if you did you saw it christ gives hope faith gives strength people really believe in love and the power of goodness you can see it in their eyes you could ask your question of each of them and get many different answers you could ask them if there should be women priests if being gay is a sin if divorced people can receive communion and you get all sorts of responses and people arguing over it but then they go up for communion and the person says the body of christ and they say amen the real bottom line draws them together
8098599 peace on earth goodwill toward men blessed are the peacemakers god is love you know the rest of the shit
8098600 well see well see by mid january half the team could be sitting due to poor grades any year we keep enough kids on the team we do fairly well how are things going with korey
8098601 too early to tell for sure but i think things will work out hes angry of course and pretty much messed up but hes a smart kid and maries parents are good folks and ill help out as i can pray for the best i guess
8098602 yeah guess so look john gotta get home see ya next week ok
8098603 no mista no is asking you we aint heard from her in over a week we talk all the time shes my shes our girl you know we call her house and that asshole sorry mista answers all the time and wont let us talk to her you dont know nothin huh
8098604 sorry kiddo not much i just found out from mr martin that her school records have been requested for a court case probably shouldnt have told you that but anyway
8098605 if you find stuff out can you call us mista
8098606 no but ill let you know what i can in school ok
8098607 is it true you adopted korey constant mista hes soooooo fine
8098608 no but my wifes in laws have agreed to be foster parents for a while and see what happens hell be around the family but more like my youngest brother in law than my kid
8098609 i would just die to have him around my family all the time
8098610 i hope so kiddo i hope so whatever happens to her shes gonna need good friends entienden
8098611 so where do your colleague and her partner live again john

8098614 welcome welcome bienvenue a chez moi jacques de soleil et marie you must be celine welcome
8098615 youre welcome and no talking shop with annette school starts thursday not tonight
8098616 i always thought of lesbians you know in that male fantasy thing of watching them have sex
8098617 well were just breaking stereotypes all over the place tonight arent we folks
8098618 dont mention it i thought youd like the scene here
8098619 very much i even have a brunch date for tomorrow
8098620 not really weve been fighting i know im gay ive known it since i was twelve i also know im catholic im a pariah to the church but most women i meet either dont want anything to do with me because of my religion or they get sick of me when they realize i am very tied to being catholic i dont feel at home in any community but this
8098621 this is what ive been looking for very catholic women who are lesbians and proud of both i didnt think it existed i cant believe it and ive been talking with annette oh my god john shes like an angel
8098622 that she is oh sister in law o mine that she is indeed
8098623 maybe you can even come out to mom and dad and everyone someday
8098624 maybe i dont know you know the monument girls mentality and all
8098625 ill bet shes not going to want to go back to vancouver
8098626 but until she comes out to the family she wont be able to take being anywhere close to monument
8098627 you were the only friend i had made love and i was a stray puppy a stray puppy straight off the boat from haiti
8098628 we met at notre dame go irish our freshman year of college
8098629 it was about the time of mid terms that fall i was a cheerleader dont you all give me that look i was and it was the week of the southern cal game and i went into the chapel as i did every week to pray for an irish victory this black girl was sitting in the back crying so i went over and asked her what was wrong
8098630 i was homesick i was lonely and in spite of my toefl scores i was not having an easy time going to school in english and my grades were horrible i was not used to bad grades i got straight as in haiti i had won a scholarship to notre dame and everyone at home was so proud of me and there i was about to flunk half my courses my first term
8098631 i felt so bad for her it was a pity thing i admit
8098632 i took her out for some coffee met up with her the next day for lunch we became friends and started hanging out we hung out all year sometime in the spring annette said at lunch one day she had something to tell me
8098633 i had been going to counseling and most of the year i worked on my homesickness my grades and other issues by the spring i was talking to the counselor about my sexual orientation i was fighting with myself i wanted to be a good catholic but i knew i was gay coming out and claiming your identity as a lesbian is hard enough for anyone but in haiti the culture i come from well let me tell you it was even harder
8098634 and i had to tell moira i was in love with her i was afraid to tell her i was afraid of losing one of the only real friends i had made since i arrived
8098635 that in spite of being a cheerleader at notre dame and coming from an irish catholic family from south boston i spend most of my weekends hanging out in the lesbian community in chicago
8098636 kisses it and whispers to me telling me to come on and that were going for a walk she tells me her whole story including that she had been afraid of telling me because i seemed so conservative
8098637 i wanted to go to harvard or chicago but miss double domer having gone to notre dame in southie had to be a triple domer and picked nd law school
8098638 shit ree thats the idiot who yahira jiminez said raped her
8098639 yeah they mentioned something about a student at your school and a priest accused of rape it sounded like that girls situation
8098640 they didnt say because of her age they just said a 16 year old sophomore
8098641 its in all the boston papers today as well a lawyer paid for by la comunidad de las madres latina filed a lawsuit against father martinez on behalf of her client omayra pabon and her sixteen year old daughter seeking damages due to an alleged sexual assault a spokesperson for the archdiocese declined to comment the papers are reporting that father martinez is listed by the archdiocese as being in between assignments and that he is staying with his brother roberto in boston
8098642 yeah look john i got a call last night from the lawyer an anita de los santos asking me you and lourdes solomon to give depositions

8098650 she called last night she said the lawyer lady got her mom a restraining order on roberto but he still lives there and yells at her and her mom for letting this lady make a suit on his brother
8098651 he hides or goes out when she comes but hes still there and shes screaming to me to help her and get her out of there and i went over but her mom and roberto yelled at me and wouldnt let me in shes screaming and roberto grabs her as she tries to come to the door and shes yelling for us to help mista hes gonna kill her iknowitiknowitiknowit
8098652 look john she just showed up here this morning when i arrived to open the building she was huddled up at the side door by the parking lot entrance she ran away apparently theyve been keeping her locked in her room at home except to meet with the lawyer she said she didnt know where else to go and said she had to see you and lourdes

8098668 true enough raul wait your turn and dont talk over people dolores pay attention to whats being said
8098669 ok thats enough you know the rules thomas thats way out of line
8098670 i wouldnt date him if he was the last man on earth
8098671 i dont blame you kiddo thomas you got me after school
8098672 i wouldnt do nothing else i would rather go to church especially youth group
8098673 oh please thats just cause your dad is the priest
8098674 all right stop it now or see ogrady i aint dealing with that language today
8098675 come on man there is no room left in that glass give us the a
8098676 you know hes got a trick dog keep thinking of shit to put pieces in that glass
8098677 damn were just forcing it let him get it done
8098678 yup i admit it the game was rigged but ive got a good point want to hear it
8098679 all these sponges are things that fill up our lives
8098680 somehow weve come to believe that all these things all the stuff in our lives is separate from god the reality is that whether were praying or in church or in this class or watching tv or playing ball or eating or sleeping god is with us god is not some other thing we have to make room for in our schedule god permeates our lives soaks through our lives like the water in the sponges no matter how much we fill up our lives with things to do and places to be and people to meet there is still room for god god is not another thing we have to make time for god is part of everything we already do
8098681 no d what happened to yahira was not of god god is not a cosmic puppeteer controlling our lives what happened to your friend was not gods will the mean part the hurt the pain what was done to her that stuff is not of god only someone who has no connection to god no care or concern for others can do such things what happened to your friend was full of hate and evil whats happening to her now is love what i do know is that god is part of what is happening to her now shes got friends like you and carmen and anita and mrs solomon and me shes getting help to heal the hurt shes suffered shes learning that a lot of people love her thats god i think
8098682 i really would rather do a lot of stuff instead of go to church especially dance but since i should want to go to church instead of anything else i didnt say it thomas mom goes to my dads church and he would tell her and she would tell him if i said anything my dad also says dancing is from the devil so i liked today because it made me think that god is with me dancing too not just praying in church ps can you get them to turn the heat up in here im always freezing
8098683 dance the night away kiddo i dont care if you never go to church a day in your life but i would be very sad for you if you never had god in your life religion does not equal spirituality remember peace mr c
8098684 dont do that man ill be good that man would wipe the floor with my ass sorry that dude hates me
8098685 i want you to apologize to royale tomorrow in front of the class do a good job or i let ogrady sponge up the floor with your behind straight

8098690 hey i know joseph cormier is out of touch but my morning ride isnt the time for me to deal with bitches and hos and what not either korey
8098691 let it go man chill youll like this one its religious
8098692 if she was so into his ass she wouldnt have said yes mister c
8098693 what makes me think your sister in law is a lesbian mr c one she doesnt seem interested in me at all and ive have been so smooth with her two no mention of any boyfriend no pictures of any boyfriend three girls call her on the phone and shes having you know guy girl talk with them she be sayin i dont want to see you anymore were not getting along i want to see other people i cant wait to see you no i broke up with her i dont have to go back for another week ill come see you i know its only half a conversation but it aint rocket science right
8098694 one she isnt interested in you because you are family foster siblings dont date each other thats the rules end of story two her damn prom picture is on the mantle with all the others and three she has friends who call her on the phone so what what are you doing eavesdropping on her anyway
8098695 maybe just maybe ill give it to you she isnt interested in such a fine man as myself
8098696 but that prom date picture guy came to visit once and that guy is a for real faggot gay man dont even argue with me mister c and i dont listen in on her our rooms are next to each other and you can hear her through the wall as if the wall wasnt there and she is talking boy girl talk with other girls you better have a talk with her and save her soul bible man
8098697 no way korey i am not going there we are not talking about this this conversation is not happening
8098698 if he screws up hes out of here mr christopher no two ways about it
8098699 right john the kids bad news hell be out of here in a month maybe even a week
8098700 hey boss permission to tell sean to fuck off sir
8098701 denied look john i want korey to make it but the diocese did not want me to let him back in here im on the line so youre on the line
8098702 gotcha id still like to tell sean to fuck off
8098703 right look john just take care of business with this one ok
8098704 you think youre beat you got nothing to be tired about right now and you probably have homework so get to it my butt is on the line for you and so is mr martins get over here
8098705 no need for that coat brown sugar ill keep you warm
8098706 well let me hug some of that sweet stuff ill keep you warmer than that ol stupid nigga
8098707 enough thomas sit down lydia go get your coat now as i was saying what did it feel like to be the blindfolded maze walker
8098708 i didnt know if i could trust anita and i couldnt hear her all the time
8098709 i felt all i dont know man abandoned i guess
8098710 but with all the yelling i couldnt hear you nigga
8098711 thomas what about you how did you feel walking the maze
8098712 that shit was not funny mr c i aint down with you no more
8098713 what did it feel like to be a guide guides
8098714 cuz i knew if he screwed up it was my fault and even if i didnt screw up helping him hed blame me for it
8098715 same reason i didnt want carmen to get hurt it would be my fault
8098716 how about you hang how did it feel guiding thomas
8098717 the maze is like life right its full of obstacles and dangers and whatever the blindfolded person is like us stumbling along trying not to get tripped up trying not to get hurt the guide is people trying to help you out but sometimes they cant
8098718 because mister when we got nothing else to help us we have god
8098719 yeah man shes right like were blindfolded and we cant see or touch god but we have to rely on a voice and have faith it can help us sometimes its hard to have faith and we either dont listen or cant listen then sometimes if we really need help we find a way to get in touch with god like how the ladies used spanish
8098720 do you think yahira will get through the thumbtacks cuz for her theyre real kinda
8098721 i think so but it is going to be very hard kiddo there are a lot of tacks and a lot of distractions but maybe as her friends we can help be her guides and help her hear the voice of god
8098722 i know its hard its the big god problem right god is all powerful god is good and yet evil happens you can make any two of those things fit together logically but not all three yet i believe in god anita there is something good and holy in the universe and ive told you guys before i dont believe it is an old man in the sky who controls everything like someone playing a cosmic playstation whatever god is god is more complex than we imagine but simpler too i think maybe we create god when we love each other and take care of each other in the most quiet place of my heart i believe in goodness and love and the ability of those things to pull us through many difficulties i dont know why it is that sometimes some people can overcome and survive even though theyve been through hell and why some people cant whatever it is that helps us make it helps us have hope and courage helps us love and helps us be the best we can be instead of the worst that spirit that idea that energy is god and its holy
8098723 my daddy says everything is gods will we just have to accept what he gives us blessings and grace or a cross to bear
8098724 with no disrespect to your dad lydia i disagree because that would mean hate and death and war and disease are all acts of gods will and if thats true
8098725 if thats true then god is one sorry ass mothafucka
8098726 i wasnt going to put it that way but basically yeah
8098727 i dont think god lets those things happen god doesnt control everything like a video game when we face pain and suffering we want the cosmic video game playing god because then theres someone to save us or someone to blame god obviously works differently but i cant claim to tell you how i think if anyone can theyre a liar all i know is that ive felt god in my heart and i believe in love
8098728 i know anita the toughest place to be in life is a place where none of the answers seem good enough nevertheless if we believe in god we have to grow up and give up the all powerful man in the sky image because it doesnt hold up the searching for something that makes sense usually takes us through darkness but if we reach the light on the other side we begin to make sense of the god we discover its difficult to explain you kinda have to take the journey yourself
8098729 deep darkness anita but i truly believe shes gonna be all right shes gonna need a lot of love and a lot of friendship if enough people can be there for her shell make it i wouldnt lie to you about it
8098730 making the sign of the cross on the forehead is a custom that goes back to the early church the ashes remind us that eventually we are all worm food ashes to ashes dust to dust we will return to the ground from which we were made its funny that we do this put ashes on our forehead and walk around its like wearing a sign that says hey im observing lent here the gospel reading today says we shouldnt do this kinda stuff jesus says to never make a show of our spiritual practices if we fast we shouldnt wear a sign that says look how holy i am because i am fasting if we give to charity we arent supposed to call the tv news and ask them to do a boston nice guy feature on us the ashes seems to be a direct contradiction of how jesus asks us to behave the only reason i can find for still doing it is not to show others what were doing but to remind ourselves of what we need to do
8098731 lent is a time where people give things up some folks give up candy or the movies or ice cream that is not what it is about lent is a time to start or renew a relationship with god instead of giving something up this year take something on start doing something you havent been doing or have never done make sure this thing you take on brings you closer to god read the bible pray meditate talk about god with your family or friends go to church go to different churches read a holy book besides the bible listen to music about god be nicer to people during your daily life forgive someone help out at a homeless shelter or food bank even begin reading the newspaper and stay more informed about gods creation
8098732 do something that focuses in on one of the four themes of lent prayer repentance charity and fasting i can tell you ive never been very good at some of these things self denial is not my strong suit so i am not trying to ask you to be holy like me i am asking you to like me spend these forty days trying one way to become more holy anyone who wants to receive ashes may come up now
8098733 are memory stones their job is to remind you of what you are taking on for lent keep the stone in your pocket or purse throughout lent when you think you have succeeded in keeping your promise to yourself to get closer to god through taking on a spiritual practice you may throw the rock away or keep it in a special place at home please use these in a sacred manner mr ogrady sister eunice and brother ernie did not want me to do this because they were afraid you would all throw them around the school prove me right for my trust in you if you want a stone for the purpose i stated please take one on your way out
8098734 you kids go ahead with the stones and do your job
8098735 look john if so much as one stone is thrown around school at a person or a window or anything your ass is grass and i wont save you from it even if i can
8098736 you know they do this at my parish every year they alternate stones and little miniature nails
8098737 bad news on that front i am sorry to report
8098738 monsignor doesnt want to do them since he is doing our other masses this year
8098739 why dont we do the hip hop services the kids have been ready for months
8098740 im not sure we are quite ready for that yet maybe at the end of the year maybe next year
8098741 for christs sake ernie the kids here hate and i mean absolutely hate going to church and you know what i dont blame them there is nothing they can relate to in church you must know they hate it they boo they make catcalls and they goof off the music is horrible we have a gospel choir and you dont even let them sing gospel music the priests especially monsignor have no clue how to talk to the kids but but when we do stuff in an urban hip hop style and involved them in the service its totally different was anyone out of line yesterday for the ash wednesday service no except for when sean tried to shut them down if you are going to be the liturgist and the liturgy police then why dont you lead the prayer services brother
8098742 leading prayer with young people is i am afraid not one of my gifts i just wouldnt feel very comfortable
8098743 im sorry brother but this makes absolutely no sense you are the campus minister but you feel uncomfortable leading prayer or retreats with the students of this campus isnt that more than a tad ridiculous isnt it in fact totally stupid
8098744 why do you do such things you have more intelligence in one cell of your brain than most people have in their entire mind but i swear your soul is out to lunch sometimes
8098745 annette i didnt mean to make him cry but jesus youve got to admit that its pretty nuts to have a campus minister that isnt comfortable ministering to kids and the liturgies and morning prayer its like hes its like we are trying to rape the kids souls
8098746 it is nothing like rape nothing at all it may not make sense and it may be bad liturgy but it is nothing like rape rape is a crime of violence i can tell you about rape my father raped me weekly usually friday nights for two years i was twelve when it started brother ernest can tell you about rape too
8098747 do you know how old ernest is johnny do you
8098748 ernest was born in england you have probably noticed the slight accent birmingham england fifty three years ago
8098749 yes hes fifty three dont be so shocked his father was a drunk who worked in factories when he could stay employed and beat on ernie when he couldnt his refuge was his mother but his father smacked him around even worse whenever he caught him looking at his mother with affection or with pleading eyes during a beating his mother wouldnt divorce his father because divorce as we know is a horrible sin right divorce is much worse than being physically or psychologically abused the beating stopped when his dad drank himself to death when ernest was ten his mother brought him to new hampshire to start over again in america she had a brother there and just wanted out of birmingham ernest recovered well enough he and his mother met a good priest at the parish they joined and both got counseling ernest was so impressed by this priest that he entered the seminary after graduating from unh with a degree in math
8098750 dont be shocked sweet honey i am told that once upon a time he was a fantastic teacher anyway while at st marys seminary in new york he was raped by one of his professors nothing was done about it so he left the seminary back home in new hampshire his rape survivors group therapist just happened to be a priest of the order of st helenas cross ernest was so impressed by this priest that he rediscovered his vocation and joined their order he went to their seminary at a college they ran in concord he decided not to be ordained my guess is that he couldnt become a priest because a priest had raped him his first assignment for the crosses was teaching math at their high school in manchester he came to boston a few years before i did the year before i arrived a student here was shot in a drive by in mattapan ernest was on the way home from visiting him in the hospital when a group of four large black boys mugged him they took the five dollars ernest had in his wallet and beat him to within an inch of his life i met ernest at an abuse survivors group run by the catholic charitable foundation i may be the only one on the staff who knows all of this maybe he shouldnt have his job no he definitely shouldnt have his job but this world owes him a lot more than a job i wasnt going to be the one to tell him hes not doing his job i hope youre happy you did
8098751 and very stupid well look she may not have told you the whole story let me tell you what i know
8098752 but schmuck will do you go tell ernest youre sorry and then ill go tell him i wrote you up which im not going to do again you realize dont you that if anyone one else was headmaster here youd be fired so go fix things up with ernest now
8098753 you have an intellectual understanding that you behave wrongly at times but im not sure you always allow yourself to emotionally experience the feedback overt or subtle you receive from others you come on strong you have a forceful personality and that can intimidate people i dont think you want to intimidate people but you do and im not sure you understand that deeply enough yet
8098754 i know it doesnt make sense for a campus minister to feel uncomfortable ministering to students i am not stupid i feel bad but i dont want to retire it would be like letting it win
8098755 the hard times the evil ive run into the pain of my life
8098756 there was a time i wouldnt have gotten so upset over what you said i would have called you a wanker told you my story and patched it up right then and there its just easier to try to ignore most things now i hope you understand me better ill stop being angry at you soon i think you listened well better than i ever imagined you would perhaps you could help me if you would endeavor to make some suggestions id have a go at trying to think about some new things i know it is not your job but i could still do all the paperwork and the phone work and gathering materials and such lets talk some more i will try to be better with the modern liturgy things but they are foreign to me we need to work together i forgive you i will pray for you pray for me ok john
8098757 i prefer ernest thats what my mother called me everyone else here calls me ernest
8098758 all i need is some fine women and some how shall i say enhancers for atmosphere and here comes the fine lady now
8098759 our lives are filled with noise we live in a world dominated by the tv the internet the radio the cd the video game the movies on the streets the noise of the traffic and the construction and people walking here and there add to the cacophony put it all together and we spend most of our days surrounded by static although god is present in all areas of our lives we can best hear her voice when we are quiet and make the time and space to listen in silence today we will begin to study prayer not saying prayers but finding ways to listen for god in the quiet of our hearts and lives the first lesson we must learn grasshoppers is how to meditate
8098760 no my friend meditation is not about falling asleep it is about being awake it is about paying attention it is about zooming in not zoning out it is about concentrating on one thing so much that you clear your mind of all else to begin our meditation practice i invite you all to lunch
8098761 wait at minute have you no manners son wait until everyone is served before you eat
8098762 our first course will be fruit salad i will pass the fruit salad around when it gets to you use the tongs to serve yourself one thats 1 o n e one raisin when everyone has been served we will eat our first course
8098763 you are to eat your raisin slowly paying attention to what it feels like in your mouth what it tastes like how it breaks down what it feels like to swallow take your time make your raisin last as long as you can when everyone is finished we will move on to our next course
8098764 then you go hungry this round kiddo everyone else eat your fruit salad
8098765 that was the longest ive ever spent eating such a small amount of food
8098766 and thats why i asked you to do it you me all of us we never actually pay attention to what were doing we just rush through our lives mostly oblivious to whats really going on around us most of us eat like skinny did at first just grabbing handfuls and mouthfuls and shoving them in half the time reading or watching tv while we do it we hardly pay attention to the food that keeps us alive we never pay attention to our breathing and thats a constant thing next and last lesson for today is how to breathe
8098767 now everybody sit up straight feet flat on the floor hands resting in your lap eyes closed and ready to listen
8098768 to your breathing dolores your breathing im serious folks close your eyes and listen to your breathing ill bet some of you cant even sit still for five minutes
8098769 youll have to separate yourselves move your chairs around and give yourself some room
8098770 better now assume the position again not that position skinny youre not under arrest i mean the position for seated meditation in your chair
8098771 if youd rather you can sit in the lotus position
8098772 you dont have to carmen just sit in your chair
8098773 good that means you need to learn how to be still and silent listen to me grasshoppers if you have ever watched a little baby breathe you will notice that they breathe from their bellies using their diaphragm as we grow up we become chest breathers we need to learn how to breathe again deeply and slowly like babies inhale by contracting your diaphragm if you cant do this place your hand palm down on your chest just under your ribs and draw the air in by contracting the muscle thats under your hand exhale by relaxing that muscle and letting the air out pay attention to nothing else except the air going in and out if your mind starts wandering just go back to paying attention to your breathing without breathing we die but we never seem to notice or pay attention to our breathing just pay attention to your breath its holy it keeps you alive remember the greek word in the new testament for spirit and wind and breath is the same word pneuma in the old testament ruah the breath of god moves over the waters pay attention grasshoppers to your breathing
8098774 i know carmen comes with the territory when youre a mystic
8098775 your pavlovian signal is about to chime my grasshoppers so i just want to say that you had five minutes of meditation today we will work at this until we meditate for an entire class period
8098776 no sleeping jeremiah this is meditation it is relaxing but it is also about being awake we need the quiet and relaxation it reduces stress lowers blood pressure and helps us listen to god and our innermost heart once we get quiet and settle our minds however the things that rise to the surface most easily are usually things we dont want to think about or remember once we quiet down these things we have repressed can work their way to the surface some of these things can be painful or unpleasant for us which is why we repress them and fill our lives with noise so we cant hear their cries this is ok though like bob marley sang out of darkness there must come out a light once we bring these things out we can deal with them and begin to heal if you should feel uncomfortable or if anything comes up inside you as a result of meditation please feel free to talk to me or mrs solomon
8098777 mr christopher i agreed to mail this for angela shes been quite upset since arriving here at st jjs her mother has her on a very tight leash ive been trying to get angela to talk to me but she says she wants to talk to you says youre the only adult who ever paid attention to her i told our principal sister margaret about the letter and she agreed that we should send it to you perhaps you could send a reply back to me and or speak with her mother
8098778 youve got to help me i hate it here youre the only one who ever listened to me well besides leon but youre the only adult who ever listened to me i cant take it any more mom says she loves me but she never listens to me and living at home is like hell this school isnt much better and i havent been able to see leon since my last day at st somebody that was weeks ago he stopped trying to call when mom wouldnt let him talk to me i hate my mom she never listens to me the religion teacher here doesnt do cool activities like you did we just read the book and answer questions sister maggie shes the guidance counselor here if you get this letter its because of her keeps calling me to her office and wanting me to talk about how i feel i dont say anything because i dont know her shell probably just tell mom anyways leon and i never did anything i think mom assumes we were having sex every day or something
8098779 what should i do dave i feel like i have to reply to her
8098780 do a good job john make sure she knows someone is still paying attention
8098781 how do you feel about marie not sleeping with you during lent john
8098782 well she sleeps with me little sister she just wont fuck me during lent
8098783 dont be gross john im serious how do you feel about her abstaining from sex during lent
8098784 its wonderful and holy celine i rediscover a relationship with my left hand lefty and i use lent for a hand in hand stroll down memory lane a nostalgic trip that returns us both to peak adolescence
8098785 it is not my favorite thing about the season no if your sister wasnt a dream lover the rest of the year id file for divorce why out of the blue do you disturb my hibernation with this query
8098786 its susan she hates it too were going to san diego together for spring break in a couple of weeks and shes pissed that i wont sleep with her while were together there
8098787 wait a minute let me get this straight no pun intended you are keeping a long distance as in cross continental relationship with a young woman you met at a party we took you to new years eve this relationship is a sexual one and you have the same lenten practice as marie in which you abstain from sex during lent and your new lover doesnt like it
8098788 so this abstinence from sex thing in lent runs in the family like rabbit pie at thanksgiving and poutines on new years day
8098789 i guess mom never had sex with pep during lent when she gave us the sex talk she really emphasized this with us she said since we all arent called to celibacy we should use these six weeks a year as a time to live a religious life in community with our families she was so serious about it she says pep hated it because all men want is sex and pep was always grumpy during lent it was always an in joke in the family among the sisters who had already had the talk anyway susan thinks im nuts maybe i am do you think i am
8098790 no shit celine marie never told me this i always thought this was her little thing a quirk but its really something i can blame on my mother in law
8098791 stop being a jerk seriously john is it that terrible
8098792 i dont like it its not me my libido doesnt take lent off but if maries does who am i to complain i love her too much and she kinda makes up for it the rest of the year
8098793 well sis she plans the most romantic and raunchy mardi gras celebrations if you know what i mean
8098794 how fucking romantic my big sister too much too much this is awesome thanks john i knew i could count on you
8098795 well i missed mardi gras but i am going to give susan an easter to remember
8098796 wait a minute kid you guys arent even married you shouldnt even be having sex not to mention the fact that you are both technically disordered and committing the sin of being practicing homosexuals
8098797 youre so funny john you old married catholics are sooooo old fashioned bye
8098798 oh snap thats dope no way no way youre serious man
8098799 you can take john with you i hate basketball happy birthday sylvie can you get me more fricot
8098800 wait a minute wait a minute dont even tell me you will be rooting for the lakers
8098801 the celtics my young friend are the most storied franchise in basketball with 16 world titles
8098802 but mr c they havent won a title since mr cormier was my age now shaq and kobie are where its at theyre the best two players in the league now that jordans retired
8098803 well my friend the last of the celtics championships was a while ago but you were already born ill wager in 1986 when the greatest nba team of all time with bird mchale parish dj danny ainge bill walton scott wedman and jerry sichsting totally dominated
8098804 oh man mr c that was back in the day jordan and the bulls would run them old school boys off the court
8098805 you do not know what you are talking about son luc longley couldnt cover walton or parish with a tent and pippen would get eaten alive by mchale whom he couldnt stop from scoring with an army and barbed wire and there would be no answer for larry legend
8098806 whatever mr c youre too much ill just say that larry bird was a slow white man with a jump shot and jordan would school him seven days a week
8098807 enough you two basketball for christs sake a bunch of sissies in short pants running around hockey thats a mans game
8098808 they are thinking of letting me live with mi tia luz and go back to school i want to get out of here its depressing everyone here is so messed up
8098809 we could if we had a coach raise your hand you can do it
8098810 what the hell did you just volunteer me for you haitian witch doctor
8098811 you should remember to stay awake during meetings johnny besides youll love it
8098812 youll have to make do with t shirts like softball
8098813 taken care of you got ten cans for each match the catholic suburban league plays ten court matches five boys and five girls
8098814 no money for those but roxbury racket said you could use their lesson baskets this year
8098815 second singles for notre dame academy for girls including district tournament semi finalist my senior year
8098816 shes always complaining the room is cold shes been asking to go to the ladies room a lot especially after lunch she has dropped a bit of weight and the girls are telling her she looks good and the boys dont have to say it in so many words
8098817 thanks you know lourdes if i had to change places with most of my students i dont know if i could get up in the morning how do they do it
8098818 i dont know but you would find a way to survive constructive or not just like they do
8098819 i watch it on tv no one really knows i like it and i never played but i want to learn i like baseball but our team sucks last year i hit 407 and had an era of 2 04 and we won two games its not like im the difference between winning and winning a championship
8098820 i dont think we have to worry about winning a championship either but we will learn how to play tennis
8098821 and we will need to recruit more players so bug your friends until they show up
8098822 the first thing we need is equipment everyone needs tennis shoes basketball shoes or cross trainers will do but no running shoes and no boots and no non athletic shoes who has a racket
8098823 before you can learn to hit a tennis ball you must be able to run and chase down the ball so that you can hit it therefore we now begin our running regimen first we will run suicides
8098824 oh snap man thats foul tennis is an easy game
8098825 these include all the lines across all the courts not just a baseline to service line to net run
8098826 we will run five suicides straight five backward five left shuffles five right shuffles and five crossovers
8098827 we will run a mile actually the distance around this block is nine tenths of a mile but close enough
8098828 folks until one of you can run a mile faster than ms kelly or me this will be our practice no rackets just running
8098829 hi miss hi mister when everyone ran away from us we got a little nervous so we chose to wait here until they came back
8098830 no rackets until someone beats me in a mile run and all mile runs come after a set of suicides
8098831 you know that we are now going to be the only team in our league that doesnt practice with rackets right
8098832 vince lombardi would chew out your ass coach anyway in a week we go to rackets if no one has beaten me yet because they wont i run road races every chance i get and i can do six minute miles
8098833 today kiddos your assignment is to do nothing go to it
8098834 what you mean mista were doing nothin jus like you said to
8098835 no dolores you are all doing something youre all dancing and talking and playing games
8098836 but i didnt ask you to chill i want you to do nothing nothing at all
8098837 ladies and gentlemen you are to do nothing just sit just be
8098838 jesus supports his janitors in the archdiocese why doesnt the church
8098839 sean theyre just practicing for life after high school and at least theyre quiet for a change
8098840 we have a hard time forgiving others and we have a hard time forgiving ourselves god is satisfied with an honest apology and a serious promise to do better its a good deal especially when we really screw up especially when we have done serious wrong caused serious hurt and pain and worst of all knew we were doing it god forgives lying cheating stealing killing unconditional love is a generous thing its so generous it even seems unfair until one realizes what honest apologies require and how hard it is to keep a promise to do better many people cant honestly apologize or forgive many people deep down as weve learned dont always think very well of themselves and sometimes feel they dont deserve to be forgiven
8098841 i want you to think of something for which you need to be forgiven and write it down on the small piece of paper i am going to turn on some music i invite you to come up one at a time and silently and sincerely ask god to forgive you then use the tongs to drop your paper into the wire basket your paper will burn up almost instantly thats how easily god forgives us thats how much god holds your sins against you
8098842 god forgives you instantly your sins die to him like a snap of your fingers or paper in fire after you drop your paper into the fire please take one of the prayer cards from the stack on the corner of the table to remind yourself that god forgives you and god loves you and so do i
8098843 for what else and for whom else should we pray today
8098844 for me my mom that we can both get into heaven
8098845 for the baseball team that we win our first game
8098846 pour mon p re et mon m re et tout le famille cormier
8098847 you learning to speak white man out there in the suburbs k c
8098848 we could really use uniforms even the t shirts you promised us donny it was pretty embarrassing going out there without uniforms
8098849 what was embarrassing was the score of your opening match mr christopher
8098850 well maybe theyd be able to play better if they felt they were representing the school
8098851 threatened to sue his fat white bigot ass on all kinds of civil rights violations and then go after the club a bunch of lawyer bullshit but if youre not a lawyer it usually works enough to scare someone into backing off
8098852 and i heard mr cooke even took a pounding john
8098853 how about you let him play baseball it was pretty shitty of you to recruit him to a feeble tennis start up effort when you know hes our star pitcher
8098854 it is well established that you are going around recruiting players
8098855 i am recruiting yes this is a first year team and we still dont have enough players on the roster however i did not recruit brian he came to me he came to me the very first day an announcement was made about a tennis team he told me
8098856 that he was sick of being the only good player on a horrible baseball team and hed always wanted to learn tennis he happens to be taking a lot of shit from his dad at home about it too he says his dad is on his back every day to quit sissy tennis and go back to a mans game he also says his dad tells him that the principal calls about every other day and asks him to ask his son to return to the baseball team for the good of the school the way i see it sean you are trying to recruit my player away to baseball
8098857 i have phoned mr cooke but only a few times just mentioning to him that he would be helping our school if he would ask his son if hes really sure he doesnt want to play ball
8098858 look sean cut it out that goes for all of you no students should be pressured into joining or quitting anything here at this school understood
8098859 hey im good dave now can i have some uniforms please donny
8098860 i dont think you can describe love you can only show it because love is not in what you say it is in what you do i have told you i love you and i do
8098861 after my wife and my own children i love nothing in this world as much as you but saying it somehow doesnt get to the heart of it showing it does that is why we washed your feet ms quinn ms jean mr martin and i washed your feet in order to follow the example of jesus
8098862 the washing of feet is a symbolic action for jesus it was an action that foreshadowed the crucifixion and resurrection washing another persons feet says i will do anything for you it is an action that says you can never give too much never love too much
8098863 in the ancient world washing the feet of guests was a servants job not the masters job
8098864 but this is no simple thing hes asking them to do because helping others out of love can hurt and hurt big
8098865 sometimes when i am tired overwhelmed with too many projects assignments papers field trips to plan tennis practices to run i think i must be nuts to do all this stuff when i feel this way i have a favorite saying i repeat to myself theres a fine line between dedication and stupidity and i just crossed it mrs solomon calls it stupid generosity she says that when you give so much that is unappreciated it is time to rethink what you are doing yet whenever i think i am giving too much when i think i am being stupid with my giving i remember that for a christian when it comes to giving out of love there is no such thing as too much giving and no such thing as stupid love
8098866 christians give till it hurts christians give even when the world says youre stupid i know from my own personal experience that when i put my heart and soul into something at work and a student disrespects me it hurts it hurts because i put all my love into what i do there can only be great pain where there is great love as jesus was a servant so should a teacher be a servant my life my job as a teacher is to take care of your life your life is my job and in that way i give my life to you
8098867 i want you all to know that you are surrounded by people at st
8098868 you understand my words today i know you do when the time comes in your lives to live out the message in these words live it out strong live it out with the strength that has gotten you this far my greatest hope for you is that whatever you do with your lives you spend your lives as servants to others because that is what being a christian is all about
8098869 and everybody used to tell me big boys dont cry but ive been around enough to know that was the lie that held back the tears in the eyes of a thousand prodigal sons we are children no more we have sinned and grown old and our father still waits and he watches down the road for the crying boy to come running into his arms
8098870 what the hell do you care you french fuck playing goddamn daddy to the po lil black chile fuck you and your french shit and your foster daddy act im just playin wit you old man the foods good and theres no one shooting at me in your little suburban village but shit man its just a front im pretending to be the good little black boy from the city you saved by taking him to the country for fucking apple pie you would fucking die in my world pops
8098871 you little shit eh you dont think i know about you i know
8098872 i know everything they tell me i know about your father hes an asshole your mother is a drug addict and a whore your brother is a criminal my wife she thinks you were sent to us by god but by god ill fucking send you back you want to go back to reform school to prison go ahead remember how good you have it with my family you choose now stay or go we dont need you you need us make a choice choose now choose now
8098873 i dont care sylvie he chooses now he can be part of our family or he can go be a criminal like his father and brother the father and brother who love him so much that they shoot him did i ever shoot him no would i ever shoot him no so let him choose now
8098874 he is not the man who fathered you but he is very willing to be your father i know my husband korey if you choose to not accept his love now he will leave you if you choose to stay with us say so he will take you home again
8098875 my daddy worked his whole life for nothing but the pain now he walks these empty rooms looking for someone to blame you inherit the sins you inherit the pain adam raised a cain
8098876 mr c what i truly dont need right now is one of those kindly white man helps black youth with an i understand your pain stories leave it
8098877 you listen to him korey hes your teacher and my daughters husband and a good man
8098878 he didnt know shit about cars tools bank accounts paying rent or how to treat women he never got sent to jail but he should have been he died with five drunken driving arrests the sixth drunk driving accident killed him when i was in africa unfortunately it killed a mom and her twin infant daughters as well you wanna know what he did
8098879 i do have to tell you the night he died and killed those three people he was driving the wrong way on route 195 how freaking drunk do you have to be to drive the wrong way on an interstate
8098880 so im still angry at the jerk its hard to forgive people like our dads
8098881 no you dont think so why because my dad was a white drunk from new bedford and your dad was a black drunk from boston i may not know what its like to be a young black man in urban america but i know more about what its like to be you than you can imagine sons of alcoholics share pain that crosses all lines
8098882 mister c man i am not going to starve myself because these crazy canadians think its some holy shit its like all of a sudden i aint doin the catholic thing and everybodys on my ass not my fault mem and pep are lighting it up today i aint even flaunting my eating man if they want to starve themselves today im straight but it dont mean i have to i go to church cuz they want me to and i aint even catholic i had some cereal this morning i made a sandwich for lunch and i just had an apple and you know what pams fucking husband ronald says to me he says why dont you have some watermelon too what kinda racist shit is that
8098883 my black ass is getting as far away from you cocksuckas as it can you people are fucking crazy
8098884 you all ran away when you were kids you got downtown to the edge of frenchtown and sat on the curb outside the laberge bakery on mission street we went to get you and bought you a croissant and then you came back with us
8098885 pep i dont think korey will be bounded by the imaginary fence around the neighborhood that we were afraid to cross
8098886 nothing pep but feeding his hunger is what started this and made him leave
8098887 and you hunger for the time time to heal desire time and your earth moves beneath your own dream landscape oh dont sorrow no dont weep for tonight at last i am coming home
8098888 we all like try to get to know him but hes wicked closed its like hes afraid of us or something
8098889 i think pam is some but not really were just concerned i mean hes always listening to rappers singing about killing policeman and he wears all that gangster clothing with his pants off his butt and his underwear showing and his boots untied dad is constantly telling him to pull up his pants and his hair is always tied up in those rows of bumps cornstalks or whatever you call them
8098890 sound like judging a book by its cover to me
8098891 but the kid doesnt seem to understand that he doesnt live in boston anymore he doesnt have to dress like that now
8098892 that maybe he likes to dress like that did you ever think that he looks at you and thinks how utterly ridiculous your clothing is and your hairstyles for gods sake lenny you have a mullet
8098893 have you ever read cornel west lenny jules do you know who noam chomsky is do either of you know who the zapatistas are what about the world trade organization or the fair trade movement
8098894 no you have no clue what im talking about but korey constant could carry on a discussion about these topics thats impressive for any high school kid have mem and pep told you the kid spends most of his time out of the house at the monument library and they have to get a lot of the books he wants through interlibrary loan i drive the kid halfway to school every day i talk to him hes as smart a teen age boy as ive ever met hes getting as in trigonometry for christs sake i have two graduate degrees and i couldnt pass his high school math class sounds like youre judging him by his clothes and his music and his skin color hes probably doing the same thing hes never lived with white people before its going to take some time and some sincere effort both ways to get to know each other
8098895 so just because you lived in africa youre both superior to us monument girls who stayed at home and got married
8098896 but we do know what its like to be the only different person around there are white people in zimbabwe but the village john and i lived and worked in was miles outside any city we were the only white people for miles around i dont know what korey feels exactly but i do know how he feels in a way that i dont think you all can
8098897 and face it whatever is different is scary add to that the fact that people dont like change and the fact that there are all kinds of trust issues among all of you its no wonder things arent perfectly smooth
8098898 anytime any of you come over here it must feel like theres a stranger in the house and to korey it must feel like hes been caught breaking into someones place even though hes been invited to make this his home
8098899 oh please celine you know youre the baby the apple of dads eye the scholarship daughter youve been their favorite your whole life they didnt even wait to throw you a graduation party at the end of high school you got a party when you decided to go to college in canada
8098900 are you serious jules god are you jealous nothing stopped you from going to school or even moving back to live in canada i dont need that shit from you
8098901 celine says you guys are pretty cool and since you already know we should ask you something first
8098902 well we werent planning on coming here so soon but we stopped in on my family in southie after i picked celine up from logan it kinda says it all to say that after we told them why we were there we were asked to leave
8098903 im also transferring to b c next year to be with susan
8098904 well be there for ya ladies but i have no idea how its gonna be received
8098905 well your timing couldnt have been worse but then again theres probably no good time to do something so difficult when were you thinking of doing it
8098906 so you two didnt go back to boston last night
8098907 whos staying at the holiday inn and what are you doing before church tonight
8098908 mem can you come down here i need to talk to you and pep
8098909 i need to tell you something that ive been hiding from you for a long time
8098910 goddamn it you went off to college and got pregnant
8098911 what partner you starting a law firm are you two accountants what the hell does that mean partner
8098912 lover then girlfriend i guess it doesnt matter what you call it
8098913 im leaving school in vancouver at the end of the year and transferring to boston college to be with susan
8098914 are you sure this isnt just a college thing a phase for the two of you
8098915 ive known i was gay since seventh grade just about the time all my friends starting going nuts about boys i started going nuts about my friends remember francois mem and pep you know why he was my boyfriend right it was our cover for each other you remember when he came out and started the gay straight club at monument high school i was supposed to come out with him then but i chickened out i pretended to be surprised about him like everyone else but i knew i chickened out on him because i was afraid of what you would say of what my brother and sisters would say
8098916 officially homosexuality is a disorder but its not a sin to be a homosexual its just a sin to have homosexual sex which is more than a bit hypocritical if you ask me its like saying its ok to be who you are but just dont act like yourself many catholic theologians disagree with the church on this one mem
8098917 sweet mother of god ive got a black son and now a queer daughter jesus mary and joseph help me whats next
8098918 i knew that god day um what a waste all the good ones are gay
8098919 whats so freakin funny excuse me im french but i dont think i need to be laughed at for my attempt to apologize for christs sake
8098920 koreys just trying to lighten the mood about something else
8098921 this is my lover susan susan wells im transferring to boston college to be with her i told mem and pep and mem went for a walk and pep has been walking around muttering but they havent disowned me yet
8098922 oh my freakin god oh thats wicked gross my sisters a dyke
8098923 father brault hes new to our parish monsignor didnt have time to talk to me because he was getting ready for the vigil mass but he sent me to father brault nice young man familys from moncton grew up in manchester i told father about celine and he said that above everything celines my daughter and to love her he said that she is disordered but not sinful unless shes sleeping with someone i didnt tell him she was then he told me to remember that jesus spent most of his time with people like prostitutes and tax collectors the people most hated in his own society he said our society is terrible for the way we discriminate against homosexuals jesus would love them and heal them he said there is even a group for gay catholics i think he called it dynasty
8098924 father said to keep praying for you and to love you i thought it was good advice i love you celine and i will pray for you always
8098925 i would like to spend easter with celine and she wants to spend it with her family is it ok if i stay with you tonight
8098926 easter here again a time for the blind to see easter surely now can all of your hearts be free
8098927 in the beginning when god created the heaven and the earth
8098928 provided we last past college and are ready to start a family
8098929 we lost our first match 0 10 none of our players even won a game our second match was worse only because we had to travel farther up to lowell to get trashed by the same score 0 10 this past wednesday we lost to bc high notre dame also 0 10 there were some bright spots however the match was in boston so we had a short bus ride my assistant coach moira kelly is an old friend of their coach so the match was friendly our best player an irish kid from southie actually came close to winning he only lost 8 10 one of the girls doubles teams won a game losing 1 10 all said and done over the first two weeks were 0 3 and much worse than our record indicates but theres hope
8098930 happy easter mista i hope its ok to call my aunt thought it would be ok and sos did carmen thanks for the chocolate bunny that was real nice carmen and anita admitted that you paid for most of it youre so nice ill see ya at school tomorrow say hi to your wife and your cute kids bye adios
8098931 you think mr and mrs cormier will be cool with celine being a dyke
8098932 i dont know korey and dont use the word dyke like that
8098933 sometimes sometimes im blind as a bat you think my in laws will be cool with celine
8098934 i dont know man but they took in this niggas ass their own daughter cant possibly be harder to deal with
8098935 salright i guess im depressed they say i cant sleep so good or when i do i have nightmares i miss my friends and i want to be here but i also just want to go home and sleep
8098936 its going to take a while yahira im surprised youre back here so soon
8098937 they didnt want to let me go but i think i was going more crazy in the hospital mrs solomon has to report to my psychiatrist every week and i have to meet with her at school and the shrink out of school and i can only stay at school if im doing ok if i cant keep up my schoolwork or get too messed up i have to go back
8098938 yes mista shes straight shes young you know but she hates roberto and neron my mom wouldnt like it but shes not around so its not like she cares much or anything
8098939 ya look more like the squirts cept for shaq there
8098940 if it isnt the freakin white shadow himself probably wants us to spot his players love thirty every game get a load of this team of yours shadow youve got to be joking why dont you just forfeit get on the bus back to the ghetto and save yourself some time and save those kids some serious embarrassment
8098941 you see those kids out there shadow rich strong is the number one ranked player in the under 18s in new england a two time defending boys state champion and all league quarterback he hasnt lost a set in over a year never mind a match this team is two time defending state champs this match is not going to be played your ghetto gang is going to be toyed with like a bad ball machine this is going to be fun funny even
8098942 you seem to have plenty of kids on this team coach
8098943 why dont you play your freshman or something theyll still beat us most likely
8098944 lady youre right our freshman would wipe the court with your behinds so since youre going to lose anyway you draw the first team if you play your third string ill play mine
8098945 well ive got a one string too lets match em up lady this shouldnt take too long and i could use some time this afternoon to watch some game film for next fall
8098946 a hundred twenty not bad but hes got a spring cold
8098947 dont exaggerate i didnt hear the word ass at all and he did not ask to see yours nor did he say bend over i think he said move over he wanted to drive you on a date
8098948 im a part time tennis coach and a full time lawyer my specialty is sexual abuse and harassment
8098949 your boys just sexually harassed my player coach im filing a report with the league and with the massachusetts high school athletics commission if you comply i wont sue your butt into poverty
8098950 being arrogant and mean is unsportsmanlike but sexual harassment is a crime were outta here
8098951 so you dont know what its like being intimate with a man at all
8098952 sexual intercourse is not the only kind of intimacy dear
8098953 i have been intimate emotionally with many people men and women and many students but not in a sexual way i have shared hopes dreams and fears with these people i have laughed with them and cried with them intimacy is not just about making love its about being there for each other loving each other supporting each other
8098954 but sister really you dont even know what youre missin
8098955 and how would you know what i am missing young lady
8098956 what experience would you share with us that could tell me what i am missing
8098957 listen honey i could share witchoo some nasty stories bout the nasty
8098958 i know some of your stories sweetie and i dont think youd want me to share them here so think twice before you offer them yourself
8098959 but sister you cant go your whole life without sex
8098960 you never even did yourself up once in a while
8098961 heavens no child i am sure you know that is a sin
8098962 he says dont worry about that because everybody does it
8098963 he say nine out of ten people do it and the other persons a liar is what he say
8098964 well now thomas i can quite assure you that i am not a liar
8098965 i can also assure you thomas and the rest of you that not everyone commits this sin especially not priests and religious isnt that right deacon goodwin
8098966 i agree that masturbation is a sin but it is one that probably nine out of ten people who are less holy than you sister commonly commit and i dont think the lord looks too harshly on it in all honesty
8098967 then how can you be a priest aint you supposed to be celibate too
8098968 a priest takes a vow of celibacy which means they promise not to have sex
8098969 technically a vow of celibacy means you promise to remain unmarried the catholic church teaches that sex outside of marriage is forbidden so a vow of celibacy ends up working like a vow not to have sex the actual vow to not have sex is a vow of chastity there are some men in the seminary who use this technicality to justify having gay sex i can tell you all that i struggled with the issue of celibacy for a long time before i entered the seminary i began thinking about becoming a priest when i was your age i had a great religion teacher in high school who got me thinking about god in a way no one else ever had before i began going to mass and i joined the church youth group at my parish i went off to college at holy cross in worcester where i dated a few girls and lost my virginity with one of them i was very involved in the campus ministry at my college and continued to think about becoming a priest one of the priests in the campus ministry submitted my name to the bishop of worcester as someone who would be a good priest i was invited to dinner with the bishop and other young men like myself i went to the dinner but i wasnt convinced that celibacy was something i could live with so i put aside pursuing the priesthood i graduated and took a job at a computer company over the years i dated and occasionally the relationships i had got to the point where they became sexual when i got laid off or downsized as they call it now a few years ago i looked at my life very seriously i had remained heavily involved with my local parish in northville where i had bought a house but i had never married it became increasingly difficult finding a job in my field and i spent even more time doing things at church i felt that god had been asking me to be a priest all along and it was finally time to go where god was leading me
8098970 hi sister my name is john christopher and i am responding to the dinner invitation
8098971 lets see john wait a minute let me check the list oh yes here you are will you be joining the bishop and father frank
8098972 well sister this is a pretty big decision and i am currently dating a very nice young woman named melissa were pretty serious and considering the fact that if i accept the offer to be in this program i will pretty much be ending the relationship with her i wanted to know if its ok if she attends with me
8098973 very funny young man if you are not interested just say so i do not appreciate your sense of humor one bit anyone who would joke about priestly vocations is quite obviously not someone we need
8098974 just here for tennis practice i didnt know you played you got mad skills how come you dont play for the team
8098975 i asked my parents but my coach said its a bad idea
8098976 i dont know he says it will ruin my game practicing with a team of beginners and besides i play some of the girls on the other teams in tournaments
8098977 you must play for our team youre awesome we suck we need you ask your parents again
8098978 i dont know they just do what the coach says
8098979 mr and mrs dickerson my name is john christopher im the tennis coach at st somebody central i didnt know your daughter was the third williams sister and i didnt know she went to our school but the kids are right we sure could use her on the team most of our kids are rank beginners and nicole playing first singles for us might help us stop our string of being shut out by everyone in the league
8098980 he said shed receive inferior coaching and her game would slip
8098981 well although im not a teaching pro like mr stokes i will not teach nicole badly in fact if mr stokes cant work with us he can tell me what to do with cole and she can do it at our practices as well
8098982 so let me get this straight mr c is the only guy youve ever done the nasty with
8098983 dont you ever wonder mrs c if there is well you know something bigger and better out there for ya dont you ever look at a guy walking down the street or some fine doctor at your hospital and think dayum doesnt it just suck that im married right now because i sure would like to have me some of that i mean everybody must think that right i figure mista knows what hes missing or not missing cause hes been with other people dont you ever wonder
8098984 not really i mean youre probably right about the sexual daydream and fantasy i think thats only human once in a while but not everyday im not day um ing my way around the ward staring at doctors all day
8098985 whats the worst thing about being married to mr c
8098986 i think your husband is very nice man and teacher
8098987 oh thank you sweetie i think hes very nice too but let me assure you he is not perfect i think the worst thing about being married to him is that he is not as careful as he should be about spending money money is the root cause of many troubled relationships more marriages break up over financial issues than for any other reason there are things that annoy me but those are things i dont like about him not things that are the worst about him or about being married to him do you understand
8098988 what are some of the things you dont like about him
8098989 he doesnt do laundry he cant fix the car cant even change the oil really what kind of man is that
8098990 he passes gas in his sleep sometimes and it smells you know very bad he spends too much money on things like cds and theater tickets and pizza he lets the kids eat ice cream on weekend mornings he doesnt call his mother often enough my god im going to run out of fingers
8098991 he watches way too much sports on television he doesnt clean the inside of the car he drives like an old lady he doesnt listen he pretends to listen and says uh huh and yeah and no but hes still reading the sports page or hasnt turned his portable cd player headphones down and hes messy look at this desk
8098992 my house is like this it drives me crazy he has a bad temper sometimes and he smell bad especially after playing sports or working out oh yeah and his feet stink hows that for a list kids has he lost any of his magic
8098993 hes a very good father he treats our kids like angels and has tremendous patience with them much more than i do hes a great cook he spends too much money on things like roses and candy and chinese take out on fridays and calls me at work during his lunch break to tell me he loves me
8098994 its all they think about s e x who wants to see wedding pictures
8098995 he told monsignor that requiring us to meet with a pastor was history in the diocese of worcester it had been policy for the last five years to have married couples do marriage preparation with other married couples couples who have been through an intensive training process to help others prepare for the sacrament since monsignor comeau has no couples working in this ministry in his parish father lou had taken the initiative and called dr and mrs archibald jans a couple from a local parish in worcester who often meet with young couples usually recent alums like you john wanting father lou to marry them at worcester state father lou had already called one of his friends in the worcester chancery and had already obtained the bishops ok to perform the ceremony in monument in three weeks
8098996 not one joke not one remark not one funny look if i see or hear anyone doing anything that even remotely resembles making fun of royale in any way i will consider it just cause to remove you from this team permanently is that clear
8098997 see man i told you i hate this class now he wants us to be faggots who have babies the freakin adopt a fudge packer infant program
8098998 thomas if you dont want to partner with a guy you can be a single parent but like i told you being a single parent is not twice the work its more like triple the work you must do everything yourself
8098999 thats fine mr c but i am not repeat in triplicate sir not n o t being anybodys wife
8099000 let me make this clear this assignment has nothing to do with sexual orientation or dating games it is about partnership and sharing responsibility the ultimate responsibility taking care of a child
8099001 but theyre just eggs man whats the big deal you just have to put it in your pocket
8099002 no theo it is much more than just putting an egg in your pocket if you do that you will end up with a pocketful of scrambled eggs this is about sharing communication and putting someone elses needs or some eggs needs ahead of your own when you have children they come first your own needs take third place at best you are not matching up with a parenting partner for fun and games this is not even about liking your partner it is about caring for your egg those who do not match themselves up will be put into arranged marriages or partnerships
8099003 man you will not arrange me with one of these niggas
8099004 hes gonna have to thomas cuz i dont see none of us females actually lining up to be with you if you know what im saying right girls
8099005 now im saying that if the little chinese girls want to partner up and be dykes for a week
8099006 listen mothafucka first of all they are vietnamese not chinese and second you will not make another dyke joke around me you got that straight nigga
8099007 goddamnit korey keep your cool you promised me you wouldnt fuck this up you know thomas is an irritating little weasel but shit hell go tell ogrady and youll be in deep and then im in deep and me and my family have put too much into you for you to fuck it up on us straight
8099008 that niggas crazy you all saw it he tried to choke me right in class our fine dean of students and principal wont like students being choked in class koreys po wont like it either time to send the crazy nigga back to lock up thats what theyll say
8099009 cant we go a week in this school without there being trouble involving mister christopher and his class
8099010 when i need your help boy ill ask for it
8099011 but yes it does seem his family isnt behaving well come with me mister constant
8099012 thats right sir take that immature young man out of our classroom environment
8099013 look i dont know if i can help you much on this one john
8099014 come on dave the kid was provoked with a racist and a homophobic remark
8099015 i know john i know but sean is boiling over with this
8099016 when isnt he boiling over dave the guys a nutcase you know it and i know it
8099017 the story sean has from thomas jefferson is that korey put him up against the wall and grabbed him by the throat and threatened him with and im quoting sean quoting thomas i am ending you end quote if this is true no matter how much i like the kid or you and your family for helping him out he threatened a student hes gone
8099018 and the two kids who did it to him are history john
8099019 the little son of a bitch racks up warnings and detentions like hes a collector hes a smarmy irritating ignorant little shit he should be out of here too
8099020 maybe so john but the cormiers have been phoned and are on their way here sean has already called the diocesan schools office and filed his report koreys expulsion hearing is at 3 p m john hes going to be asked to leave
8099021 goddamn it what the fuck has happened to you dave does the diocese have the principal police on your ass motherfucking hell david korey has been nothing but perfect here since his return he gets straight as hes joined the social justice thingamajig that brother ernest put together and hes organized the efforts to support the striking diocesan janitors he joined the tennis team hes applied for a summer program at mit he reads cornel west in his spare time thomas jefferson is a dog turd who barely passes enough classes not to flunk out and is always involved in some stupid childish shit going on around here remember removing all the rolling balls from the computer mice that was a fucking great one
8099022 stop it john watch your language and well look calm down
8099023 i am not going to let the jefferson kid fuck korey over dave no way
8099024 i am not asking you to let anyone get fucked over john but you are getting out of control if korey attacked and threatened thomas there is nothing we can do we had better start making plans for him i have called a friend at b c high they will probably take him hed be in an accelerated program there john it might be better for him anyway
8099025 yes i am john but look i havent talked to him yet sean says korey wont say anything about it the kids playing it smart john hes making us make a case on thomass word so far none of the kids questioned claim to have seen anything perhaps you would like to corroborate thomas jeffersons story
8099026 nothing happened dave there was a commotion and vo got trampled when i looked up the two of them were nose to nose korey yelled at him dave thats it
8099027 good now look let me talk to korey and get his side of the story
8099028 i want to tell you what i know about koreys family something that might be able to explain why he was so upset that thomas felt threatened
8099029 his foster sister is gay i know that john the cormiers told me hes also probably sick of thomas giving the little asian girls shit all the time he just cant take justice into his own hands
8099030 do any of you girls know why mr martin and mr ogrady want to talk to you so urgently that you need to be called out of practice
8099031 mr martin wanted to know if i knew some little nigga sophomore named thomas something or other
8099032 we told him we didnt know him never heard of him
8099033 yahira was there with embrianna and shelley they are soooo cute
8099034 yeah mista yahira was there and she goes amigas tell him thats mr martin mista tell him about how thomas grabs and pinches everyones ass so we did hes like a pig mista he pinches you in line at lunch and in the hallway and everything all the sophomore and freshman girls hate him carmen tells mr ogrady but he dont do nothing
8099035 and mr martin says to us thanks and you can go back to practice now
8099036 except that yahira gives us a big hug and says to mr
8099037 i didnt say shit to ogrady i just let him think what he wanted i told mr martin what yahira told me and he called in some other girls to corroborate yahira goes and talks to thomas sitting in mr martins waiting room and says she and the amigas are nailing him for sexual harassment if he dont change his story he tells her to fuck herself then anita and carmen come in with jj and cole they go into mr martins office one at a time and when they come out thomas is sweating like hes a little baby egg ready to cry for his momma when mr martin calls us in thomas apologizes in that kiss ass voice of his for accusing me of assaulting him ogrady lets rip a fit and martin tells him to chill and thats it
8099038 where the hell have you been cole you will never move up the new england rankings this way you are wasting your talent with this bunch girl
8099039 so what cole your team of hackers and lobbers beat their team of hackers and lobbers big deal is that going to help you beat lynne sorensen or lisa holden i doubt it
8099040 daddy daddy we won we won we won i served 16 aces you should have seen hang she volleyed like a mad woman it was da bomb her and carmen needed to win their tie breaker for us to win the match and we all watched every point like it was the world and they won and we won it was the absolute bomb
8099041 we must have a serious discussion about coles continuing to play on this team she has cut back her serious workouts to a dangerous level i am beginning to feel she will just not be ready for the summer tournament season if it continues any longer
8099042 tell me more about the match baby girl but slow it down a little
8099043 well i won fast and so did brian and then anita won she worked on her serve with me this week and i showed her how to hit topspin and the girl couldnt return it
8099044 now coach stokes can you see how happy my baby girl is can you i have not seen her this happy playing tennis in years since she won her first tournament when she was ten that was seven years ago seven years since shes looked this happy after playing tennis you can save your breath this team is the best thing that has happened to cole and her tennis in a long time you find a way to work with it
8099045 dont but richard me this or mr dickerson me that coach cole is playing on this team why dont you help them out you cant run lessons while they use the courts anyway
8099046 you spent how much jesus john dont you ever think before spending any money
8099047 relax ree the stipend for coaching will more than cover that
8099048 we could use that money for building a deck on the back of the house john and you said yourself that st somebody couldnt give you the going rate for coaches so i assume it is not going to be that much in the first place and you just spent more than a hundred on pizza you are not going to do that after every match are you you are not going to do that again right right
8099049 congratulations coach that sure was some good news you left on my phone messenger mustve felt pretty good bet you took the kids to mickey ds afterward too
8099050 tell her ill give you half but next time how about ice cream cones ok
8099051 listen john i got some other good news today as well while i was in court this afternoon my office got a call from the massachusetts high school athletics commission they definitely dont want our case against boselli to go to court they are scheduling a hearing for april vacation
8099052 but thats not the best part i told them it wasnt good enough and that i was filing suit in the morning unless he was suspended until that hearing
8099053 indeed now go tell your wife she only has to be half as mad at you for your over generous spending habits
8099054 before you say anything folks i just want to play you the videotape
8099055 this isnt on our agenda john we are supposed to be talking about the use of scripture and the catechism in the curriculum next after that we need to discuss the pentecost mass
8099056 i know rosie but what i want to show you is a tape of what we could do for the pentecost service so it is on the agenda sorta
8099057 it is not appropriate john brother and sean and sister eunice have all agreed and in any case the curriculum item is first and since i am chairing this department meeting we will stick to the agenda
8099058 excuse me rosie but i did say i would think about it for the end of the year
8099059 how about we stick with the order of our agenda but john can show us the tape as part of our discussion of the pentecost mass
8099060 what it boils down to is the two of you dont use the catechism much in your teaching
8099061 rosie the catechism is the basis for all our teaching in this department john and i dont believe memorizing it is necessary to get across what it has to teach us if you do then that is your prerogative as a classroom teacher i advise against it but wont forbid it and like the discussion of the use of scripture i dont think we need to pursue this any further
8099062 thanks for allowing me to show this rosie i know its not on the agenda in the hope of inculturating our school liturgies i have been meeting with a group of students two or three times a month after school since early october last week i videotaped part of our meeting some students have been working on writing raps others have been working on readings and others on choreography a few of our artists have been making environmental decorations for the worship space i told them that once they were ready i would pitch their efforts to all of you and see if we could be allowed to try them out at a school liturgy we have most of the parts of a mass on this tape but the opening procession should be enough to give you the idea
8099063 this rhyme is on time and its gods not mine
8099064 well she took that better than i thought she would
8099065 yeah i thought shed pick up the vcr and throw it out the window
8099066 or at least eject the tape and throw it in the trash
8099067 the tape in the rubbish bin is exactly what i thought shed do
8099068 well mista you know how i told you my father is a janitor well he works at st annas hospital my whole family is here
8099069 well all right hey maybe you could hold our signs our hands are full with our cute kids at the moment
8099070 i know but its the father of my eggs and i should listen
8099071 the church of boston employs over 300 janitors to clean its churches hospitals agencies and schools
8099072 so i say to the bishop dont teach me about justice practice it dont teach me about love show it thank you
8099073 fine annette fine excellent in fact but it wasnt an interview i just met the director of interfaith programs to get some information about a job
8099074 you must have charmed them with your majestic vocabulary and communication skills
8099075 very funny it was interesting though annette father guy had told marie they didnt pay much for such a job but shit annette the starting pay would be about fifty five grand thats a huge increase over my st somebody salary and with the cstub contract up at the end of this year and the way the diocese is treating the janitors i thought it sounded pretty good
8099076 so it does johnny the money anyway but would you like the job
8099077 sorry the guy i met with today jake betters anyway jake said that half the work day for the kids is spent on the job and the other half in group sessions with participants at local affiliated churches i would be responsible for designing the spiritual component and working with the local pastors and youth ministers participating in the program to train them and the volunteers
8099078 yeah and get this annette the summer switch program offices are housed in interfaiths headquarters in downtown worcester and interfaith runs a daycare out of that same site and the kids could go for free
8099079 but i bet you agreed to go back for one
8099080 i did the first week of june the program is set for this summer but they want someone in place by july 10 when this years program starts to work the summer with the outgoing director i couldnt say no to exploring the job annette youve got to admit it sounds almost too good to be true the job also has four weeks paid vacation a year
8099081 just remember sunshine things that seem too good to be true usually are
8099082 he quit baseball to try out at the beginning of the season
8099083 his serve is pathetic for a kid his size but his strokes are solid
8099084 well we cant spend too much time with brian and cole the kids playing doubles are such beginners that we spend most of our teaching and drill time with them and leave cole to run practice drills for the singles players
8099085 and im only part time help so that leaves john as one coach with 14 kids
8099086 maybe i could help out a little you here tomorrow
8099087 no we have matches wednesday and friday so no practices this week due to school vacation but well be back monday at 3 30
8099088 ill see you then ill work with nicole and the big boy on one
8099089 what about the kids on two and three singles maybe you could help them too
8099090 in fact maybe the three of us could sit down and talk about how to best run this program given three coaches and 14 players
8099091 you beat a team better than this and ill help out all i can
8099092 well wait a minute ladies is there anyone else who wants to be the mom
8099093 ok yahira you can be the mother and the mother does get to pick the godmother but the godmother is not just an honor you give to a friend the godparents are supposed to be people who will help you be christian parents and help you raise a christian child they should be people who share a vision of how to be a christian with you and will help you communicate that to your son or daughter as he or she grows up technically theyre even supposed to be the confirmation sponsor when the time comes are you sure you want carmen to be that person yahira
8099094 if that means we get to make the baby with the mother then it must be me
8099095 i know who she wants to be the father mista
8099096 he aint got the money for a diamond he aint got the goods to be my boo
8099097 well then mista would you do us the honor of being the godfather of our baby
8099098 thanks guys but i think it should be one of your classmates like the godmother
8099099 well mista you said yourself that godparents should be people who will help you raise a christian child someone who will help you be christian parents and help pass on the values you believe in to the child right well mista
8099100 i dont see that any of these niggas qualify and since you are the man when it comes to god and stuff who better than you
8099101 there is an unbelievable amount of work needing to be done here
8099102 are you going to vote to accept the agreement juan
8099103 si it is not everything we wanted but many of us are about to miss a second rent payment many are not ready to keep fighting just to be part of majwa many think we have gotten the best deal the bishop will give us and we should take it
8099104 if the diocese recognizes majwa the teachers for sure and probably others such as the nurses would put the pressure on for recognition of membership in larger unions
8099105 some of us will continue to work with majwa the agreement is only for a two year trial if the bishop doesnt treat us well we may have more support next time to hold out for majwa recognition
8099106 well it will be good to have you back juan
8099107 shes going back to papillon more news soon come see me if you want
8099108 its yahira she just left her aunts house theyll be here in a few minutes
8099109 mr christopher mrs christopher i think it is wonderful that your family has taken in korey
8099110 but i must tell you i am not so sure yahira should be seeing him or any boy right now
8099111 im not sure what you mean theyre going to a school formal tonight i dont think they have a very serious relationship its not as if theyve been dating for months or even weeks
8099112 yahira isnt even allowed phone calls from non family members at papillon and although they let girls go to chaperoned events like this dance she isnt going to be seeing very much of him considering hes living with my wifes parents half way across the state and shes not in school right now
8099113 still i am worried about her he used to be in a gang no
8099114 every sinner has a future and every saint has a past
8099115 well this is a change of events angela good to see you
8099116 i miss your class the most mister christopher i hate st jjs i miss everyone
8099117 the missus had to be out of town so i thought it would be a good way to not have to cook dinner and not have to spend money
8099118 i get out just fine davey listen johnny did you hear about your friend butchy
8099119 i got a call yesterday afternoon from the massachusetts high school athletic association seems like that hearing you went to april vacation did its job they suspended boselli for the rest of the season
8099120 really and theyre making him write a formal apology to your tennis player your team and the school they also suspended two of their players for the rest of the season including states i didnt know when i asked for a tennis coach you was gonna stir everything up ive known butchy a long time hes not a bad guy
8099121 sure donny hes a fine gentleman as far as assholes go
8099122 so donny is there money in the athletic budget to buy my team jackets when they win the league tournament
8099123 you gotta be freaking kidding me thats what fundraisers are for right boss
8099124 if our religion teacher pulls off a tennis miracle and our team wins their league tournament id help you find the money in the athletic budget for jackets trophies and monogrammed tennis bags for the whole team
8099125 send down the fire of your justice send down the reign of your love come send down your spirit breath life in your people and we shall be people of god
8099126 in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit welcome to our celebration of the feast of fire
8099127 come on yall the response line is after me send out your spirit lord for all its worth renew the crib and the school the block and the earth
8099128 as pastor of this church i order you to end this unorthodox service immediately
8099129 now monsignor surely the people of god are praying and celebrating the eucharist wonderfully here
8099130 there is no need to harden your heart and cause division
8099131 you are causing division you and that christopher who got you into this im sorry he invited you here but you are not welcome at st somebody
8099132 mr ogrady that is no way to treat our guest from jamaica and it is certainly no way for the principal of the school to speak in gods house
8099133 that boy is not going to preach in this church
8099134 what up yall god has sent us the holy spirit so we can overcome any obstacles in our way the world puts down our music our dress and we are told we are no good because of the color of our skin and the languages we speak and our religions and our age but im sayin we are strong and we are mighty and nothing and no one can stand in our way with god on our side i know i have learned that god is about justice and fair play and everything rides on that when folks that are being put down rise up for themselves theres the holy spirit holdin em up at the beginning of this year i didnt even think i believed in god but i learned this year that god believes in me i learned this because i learned people believe in me mr christopher believes in all of us what else can it be but something holy in the universe something out there working for all thats good i still dont know if i believe in god but i believe in something that loves me that loves us that something is holy and sacred and that spirit is real maybe the holy spirit is that feeling you get when no one believes in you and yet something helps you get through maybe the holy spirit is what you feel when you know people are supporting you either way its what holds you up and its good its all good i know the spirit is here give it up my sophomores let me hear you
8099135 you will not use unapproved bread for eucharist in my church this is my church and i will not allow it
8099136 ah surely father the bread is unleavened yes look at it are they not flat whole wheat loaves it is perfectly licit and appropriate for the lords table
8099137 students are not allowed to consume wine during school masses that is an archdiocesan directive
8099138 but have you forgotten that what is now wine will soon be the blood of the lamb of god these young people are not only allowed but encouraged to receive communion under both species
8099139 i could if i didnt have to go to canada with the cormiers
8099140 you know how they go to canada every summer right well they cant leave me alone in the house or alone at a residential program while they are out of the country they want to go to canada july 1 and the mit program starts july 6
8099141 most kids dont get a chance at either of these programs korey isnt one enough
8099142 i know mr c but im saying that if i can go to mit first and then to bradford it might help me make it at bradford
8099143 i know mister but i just got to have that chance i got to do you think there is any way you could talk to joseph
8099144 i dont know korey they plan their year around that time in canada
8099145 korey you cant keep playing like this get your head in the game youre playing his baseline game play your game rush the net and put the pressure on him to hit passing shots dont be afraid to lose just go for it on every point theres a big difference between losing and being a loser youre a winner this whole team is full of winners weve got a chance to make the league playoffs do you realize that not one of our school teams has made the playoffs since ogrady was a star pitcher for the baseball team that won that state title trophy in mr martins office st somebody needs a winner korey go for it
8099146 its ok mister i know this is going to sound hard and mean but maybe its for the best the child snuck away to see me you know her ma wouldnt let her see me and treated her something awful made a damn slave out of the girl i tried to tell folks but even the preacher at my church thought i was a crazy old woman the girl would never say anything against her mother such an innocent thing she loved her mother even though her mother treated her like dirt so maybe its best dear i already miss her so much
8099147 youre right i just hope it doesnt force us to move in with korey and my parents
8099148 thanks for treating my boy so well coach christopher i dont know what he sees in tennis but he likes it and hes doing well i guess
8099149 well well mr cooke your son is going to qualify for the state boys singles tournament and is the first player in over two years to win a game against this kid from medeiros who is three time defending league champ and two time defending state champ brian passed well weeks ago hes had a phenomenal season
8099150 well i just wanted to say thanks and that im sorry i gave him and you and the school a hard time about his playing tennis
8099151 no problem mr cooke its been my pleasure brians a great young man you should be very proud of him
8099152 hey kiddo sorry i havent been up to see you things have been busy lately
8099153 sok mista i like the cards you keep sending me theyre funny they make me laugh and i dont laugh so much you know
8099154 hows things going does ms riley have things under control
8099155 the bastards who run the church are still trying to play with us we agreed to drop the restraining order if they make the payment
8099156 thirty thousand cash up front if we sign a promise not to talk to the media or otherwise discuss the case and if we drop the restraining order
8099157 what are you going to do isnt he still at that parish in your neighborhood
8099158 but miss riley says we wont drop the restraining order until hes moved to a parish outside the city

8099167 ok everybody listen up form a big circle shoulder to shoulder around the center of the court
8099168 did any of you guys take geometry that is not a circle a circle is round come on folks move it shoulder to shoulder
8099169 now i want everyone to reach both hands up into the air and across the circle grab someones hand with your left hand and someone elses hand with your right hand you cant grab the hand of the two people next to you or on either your left or your right stretch across the circle for hands
8099170 now my young friends you must untangle yourselves you may not break your handholds or you must start over have fun
8099171 youll have to excuse my husband girls hes a bit tongue tied after teaching all day
8099172 yeah anyways sorry to bother and all but my raving bitch of a mother has decreed that i be angies confirmation sponsor and i couldnt care less i hate all that church bullshit anyways since i dont wanna do it and angie wanted to ask you to do it i drove her out here
8099173 angela im honored but i dont think your mom would approve
8099174 not approve shed go wicked ape shit id pay money to see that fit
8099175 well im pretty sure i wouldnt like to see it
8099176 i dont even want to imagine it angela im really honored but i can only agree to this if its ok with your mom
8099177 i dont think thats the best way to handle it angela but if you get your moms permission id be glad to
8099178 what the heck right it was worth a shot my sisters a good kid you know
8099179 get out i have nothing to say to you inviting my daughters out to your home maybe there was something between you and the jiminez girl after all there wont be any of that with my daughters
8099180 first of all rosie i didnt invite your daughters to my house they just showed up they brought cookies from the bakery and asked to see me i wasnt home from tennis practice yet so my wife invited them in second if angela wants me to be her confirmation sponsor id be honored to do it i told her shed have to ok it with her mother first shes a good kid rosie last but not least when you want to communicate with me try talking to me leaving me notes and giving me orders doesnt work very well come to think of it although it may be none of my business talking to angela might be a better way of communicating with her as well
8099181 i aint much for praying but i want to thank the lord for you kids and this team you just go play your best now
8099182 john if you have a minute can you look at this
8099183 i was hoping you could you tell me why is korey getting mail from this butterfly program one or two of these things have been coming to the house for about six weeks now do you know what this is is it another summer program
8099184 sorensen has always run cole around tired her out and then put her away i just didnt think cole would stay with her like this i hoped she would but lord john im surprised shes done it
8099185 it may be coach that shes never really wanted to win this badly before
8099186 maybe john but you know ive tried to train her to have that killer instinct i just thought it would kick in and it never seemed to
8099187 she didnt discover it today shes not playing to defeat lynne sorensen shes playing for jj and anita and carmen and hang and korey and royale face it stokes you were trying to mold a champion for an individual sport out of a young woman whos a team player at heart once she had someone to win for other than herself she started to rise to another level what do you think
8099188 i know im right in fact i know shes going to pull out this match
8099189 how can you be so sure shes barely hanging in there
8099190 true enough but i notice things you dont coach youre a professional teaching pro and even though i played high school and college tennis you catch things that i still forget to look for such as transferring weight on your serve or slight drops of the shoulder on the back swing what i do is teach and i know my kids after every point cole has won today she has rubbed the armband shes wearing for royale shes had moira holding up notebook pages with the scores of the other matches shes playing for the team stokes and she knows she needs to win shes going to shes already fought off three match points against sorensen is beginning to doubt herself you can see it in her eyes cole will take this watch
8099191 i dont know i just got here too mem says hes losing but she doesnt really know tennis better ask moira
8099192 we got a season that looks like it might come up a few points short of a state tournament bid for the boys korey just lost serve again hes down 4 5
8099193 when korey comes over here unfold this and hold it up against the fence
8099194 i just wanted them to see me win so badly that i kept fucking up mr c
8099195 were both gonna be in trouble if he hears us talking like that
8099196 nope no call yet but you barely got in you know youre gonna draw one of the top seeds and get blasted right out of the tournament
8099197 sorry john i tried to get you before you got down here i left a message with judy to have you stay in my office but i guess she didnt see you
8099198 no she didnt i went to donnys office when i got in to see if he had word on the tennis playoffs and then came up the other stairs i guess i missed a special memo today huh
8099199 look john can you come back to my office with me you wont be teaching today
8099200 john just shit look ill explain on the way just calm down
8099201 thank you all for agreeing to have the catholic school office administer the catechetical assessment
8099202 for the record you just came in and ordered us to do it we are administering the test because you are requiring us to do so neither i nor the chair of the theology department believes the test has any educational or catechetical value neither do we believe the test is an accurate measure of either the faith development of our students or of our instructors ability as catechists
8099203 very well then david thank you for cooperating with us now if you would come with me we are going to meet with monsignor scanlon down the street in the dining room of the rectory
8099204 that unorthodox methods of instruction and unorthodox theology are being used and promoted by annette jean and john christopher with the willing approval and support of their headmaster david martin
8099205 is to gather information in order to determine whether dismissal proceedings are warranted for each of you pending the outcome of these proceedings you will all be suspended without pay
8099206 what the hell is going on here are you people for real what about our kids
8099207 that sister frances and i will take over the classes taught by miss jean and mr christopher and mr ogrady will serve as acting headmaster of the school i will chair this committee father ratbourne is serving on the committee in his role as archdiocesan director of the office of religious education and father natsowiscz is serving in his role as the theological advisor to the archbishop bishop gallagher is here as the auxiliary for metropolitan boston mr ogrady as acting headmaster will represent st lorcans high school
8099208 sean ogrady cannot sit in judgment on this he cant be objective he stands to gain from the outcome of the proceedings
8099209 i have no problem with sean being here as headmaster of the high school ive known him since we were students here together we played on the state championship baseball team together sean ogrady is and always has been a great team player i am confident he will only seek what is best for the school yourselves and the archdiocese
8099210 the bishop will be addressed by his proper title during these proceedings mr christopher you are aware that bishops are traditionally addressed by the faithful as your eminence are you not
8099211 i am aware that the bishop can shove his title up his rectory the problem is that what is best for myself david annette and the school may not be what is best for the archdiocese
8099212 it is precisely that attitude that has landed you here mr christopher you are not a team player
8099213 lets get something straight before this starts sean i do not work for you i do not work for david or annette or sister claire or the archbishop of boston i work for my students like any teacher worth a damn i am also not taking part in this star chamber
8099214 sit johnny sunshine if you walk out they win anyway
8099215 shes right christopher if you do not participate in these proceedings you will be fired failure to participate in a disciplinary hearing is grounds for dismissal according to your union contract
8099216 our union contract also calls for the buildings union rep to be present at any such hearings neither mr christopher nor i will participate until barbara hartman is here we also have a right to have a union officer present and i wish to exercise that option
8099217 you are johnny sunshine the union cant afford a lawyer
8099218 the charges against mr christopher are four fold one he has repeatedly used inappropriate methods of instruction two he has taught his students theology contrary to the official teachings of the catholic church three he has conspired to violate school and diocesan rules against violence in the catholic schools four he has had inappropriate contact with at least two female students
8099219 the charge against mr martin relates to the third charge against mr christopher mr martin conspired to violate school and diocesan rules prohibiting violence toward students and staff
8099220 the two charges against miss jean are one she taught her students theology contrary to the official teachings of the catholic church and two she is an open practicing homosexual
8099221 she seemed very interested in the name of the archdioceses lawyer she said just dont sign anything
8099222 among other things mr christopher has done that are inappropriate for classroom instruction are the following items at issue
8099223 annette jean signed a public letter to the boston globe as a member of a boston area lesbian feminist theology group condemning the archdiocese for the removal of sister norma jennison from her position as director of hagar house a battered womens shelter run by the archdiocese this public declaration of homosexuality disqualifies miss jean from being employed to teach theology in the archdiocese according to the union contract with the archdiocese we also have a statement that annette jean was at the liturgy for which sister jennison was removed
8099224 because you believe in the right of labor to organize sunshine
8099225 why are you so sorry ernest its not your fault
8099226 i should be in there with you actually the only reason im not is that my order still technically owns the building the diocese called my superiors yesterday to tell them i would be facing accusations allowing illicit and invalid liturgical norms as campus minister and such nonsense my superior told them if they dared the order would sell the school out from under them the matter was dropped im going to stay and give them all a piece of my mind
8099227 youre safe and untouched keep it that way we appreciate your support
8099228 mista they said you was in trouble and luz says i dont have to say anything but i want to this isnt fair youre my angel mista its not fair what ms riley told me they said about you is wrong ill tell them mista i will will
8099229 im so sorry fathers sister your eminence they forced their way in i tried to stop them
8099230 dont worry scanlon theres no need for all these folks to be here well just clear them out and continue with the business at hand once theyve gone
8099231 i am ms moira kelley i am legal counsel for ms jean and mr christopher
8099232 im not only ms jeans legal counsel i am her partner her lover she is a lesbian a homosexual and proud of it as am i because of this she resigns her position as a teacher of high school theology in the archdiocesan central high school system
8099233 there are no formal charges here this is not a courtroom its a rectory and this is not a trial this is only a meeting to investigate whether there is enough merit to some of these accusations to stage a formal hearing
8099234 both of my clients informed me that the word charges has been used and if there is no legal interest then why is a legal counsel for the archdiocese present
8099235 i have brought with me a number of people who should be heard by this panel they are students parents of students and colleagues of mr christopher each can tell you things about his integrity and professional conduct that i wager are absent from any dossier on him you have put together
8099236 im quite sorry miss but this panel is not listening to any of these people i am asking you once more to leave i warn you that if you do not all clear this room and leave this rectory i will have monsignor scanlon call the police and have you removed
8099237 when the monsignor calls the police i ask him to be so kind as to ask them to pick up father neron martinez at the rectory of our lady of sorrows in jp
8099238 you do recognize the name of father martinez dont you
8099239 yes im sure you do dick seeing as you are representing him and the archdiocese in a matter involving young ms jiminez here i have reporters from both the globe and the herald outside and a colleague from my firm at suffolk superior courthouse either you listen to these folks tell you about the real mr john christopher or my colleagues will file charges of rape against father neron martinez
8099240 hes my angel id rather help him than have any of your stupid money aunt luz
8099241 and her lawyers have tried this bluff with the archdiocese once already
8099242 indeed bridget why dont you tell your new friends here that this is old news it might reflect more poorly on you and your client than on the archdiocese
8099243 maybe so dick but it would also reflect poorly on the archdiocese as would the proceedings here with this ecclesial grand jury
8099244 sure there is your eminence we can all listen to these people who have come to help you all decide what to do in this matter
8099245 ok then go ahead but try to have everyone be concise
8099246 jim can you stay there a while good hold on until you hear from me again thanks
8099247 some of the teachers say you are leaving mista youre not gonna leave us are you
8099248 i dont know kiddo i dont think so but i wont lie to you i just dont know ive told the school im returning and as of right now i plan to but i dont know whats going to happen

8099253 mom why are you lying mr c never called me or invited me to his house i contacted him he listens to kids mom he really listens i came to see him because he was the only person i could think of that i could really trust to listen to me you dont listen mom you just yell and punish me and ground me and tell me how much i am disappointing you and letting you down and letting god down mr c is always telling me how much god loves me you talk about what god is like mom but mr c shows it by caring about people
8099254 i love you mom but i cant stand you any more do you know how awful that feels i dont want to end up like mark and guido and ann and rocco its like they hate you ann doesnt want to be my confirmation sponsor she doesnt even go to church anymore mr c would be a great sponsor and for all the right reasons but you hate him so much because his students like him and because i like him that you wont even consider it thats not christian i love you mom but im not going to let you make me think that liking a black guy and going on dates and listening to music is evil and im not going to let you lie about mr c i cant believe youre doing this to him all the time i told him you were driving me crazy all he ever told me was to try and give you a break and not to stop loving you please stop this mom please
8099255 i can give you until the end of the weekend john

8099257 but is this the right place for my heart annette
8099258 she takes her own time with such things listen carefully
8099259 you might need someone to hold on to when the answers they dont amount to much somebody that you can just talk to and a little of that human touch
8099260 i know ree but does anything sound like i have to go back
8099261 save those john when you get down or arent sure if youve done the right thing you can take them out and they can remind you

8099266 but youd have to deal summer switch bullshit john every job has its share of crap youd be dealing with the catholic church and other churches with summer switch
8099267 i know ree but i dont want to make the wrong decision what do you think
8099268 i think you should do what makes you happy although the money and the commute and the daycare would be nice i also think that youll never be satisfied with anything you do
8099269 ever since ive known you john youve always been moving from one thing to the next the peace corps to grad school to teaching to hospice ministry to teaching africa to boston to chicago to fall river to bethelle the only thing thats been constant has been me
8099270 eventually youre going to have to make a decision to stick with something long term you cant keep job hopping forever
8099271 for god to tell me what she wants me to do
8099272 seriously john you have got to be the dumbest smart man i have ever met
8099273 waiting for god to tell you what to do those kids love you john what else does god have to say

8099310 we dont have parental matchmaking sessions in singapore i think our peoples associations government funded neighbourhood community centres should consider organising similar sessions
8099311 they are serious and not just out to have a good time but they face difficulties because some have never dated and once they start work and settle into a routine theres no opportunity to socialise and meet new people
8099312 marrying early has its advantages couples who marry young have the luxury of putting off having a baby should they choose to prioritise their career or alone time with each other
8099313 of course it can be said that as a country gets more affluent and educated its citizens become more picky
8099314 so they have to work for a few years and save not everyone works in a well paying job
8099315 marriage perhaps needs to be weighed against other responsibilities of todays singaporean women
8099316 i could imagine being married but unless i have the financial security to provide for a child it would be the elders who are higher on my agenda as compared to a yet to be conceived child i wouldnt be immediately persuaded by subsidies and tax cuts if my existing responsibilities are not alleviated to a certain extent
8099317 i am certainly not resisting it but neither am i pursuing it actively as the next milestone of my life without doubt financial independence has opened up more options for women including myself who no longer need to consider marriage as a lifetime meal ticket

8099357 american businesses and consumers were facing elevated borrowing costs and reduced credit availability
8099358 the overall mood is still one of caution theres not much out there to get investors excited
8099359 but the bigger picture is that there hasnt really been a major breakdown considering all the bad headlines out there from higher oil prices to the credit crisis and troubled housing sector
8099360 the market continues to question the same things and were not really getting any answers
8099361 i think thats one of the reasons why people are staying on the sidelines

8099597 we are pleased that the judge saw through the dfls desperate political stunt aimed at preventing us from educating minnesotans about the threat to private ballots in the workplace
8099598 jesus and satan got into an argument over which of them was the better computer programmer finally god got tired of the bickering and told them that he would judge a contest between them they each had four hours to write the best program they could and then god would decide the winner

8099611 this years theme prayer americas strength and shield reflects the words of psalm 28 7 which states the lord is my strength and shield my heart trusts in him and i am helped we hope this powerful message will not only serve as a catalyst to draw gods people closer together as we intercede corporately on behalf of our country but that it will encourage individuals to seek the lords guidance for their personal concerns as well
8099612 if you would like more information on how you might unite with your fellow believers and citizens to intercede on behalf of our great nation i invite you to visit the national day of prayer web site
8099613 it was observed that there is a considerable number of small scale mining claims that had long been approved in palawan but have not been operational up to this date
8099614 two years for exploration and operation period granted is quite ample time to conduct indispensable preliminary mining activities and eventual operation
8099615 to determine the sincerity of the mine operators to do business and deter speculators it has become imperative to take appropriate measure to contain this alarming trend
8099616 it cannot be denied that god in choosing and destining mary to be the mother of his son granted her the highest honor
8099617 to this day we cannot enjoy the blessing brought to us in christ without thinking at the same time of that which god gave as adornment and honour to mary in willing her to be the mother of his only begotten son
8099618 the more the honor and love of christ increases among men so much the esteem and honor given to mary should grow
8099619 i believe in one holy catholic which means universal and apostolic church without even having to think about the theological problems this causes
8099620 it is possible according to catholic doctrine to affirm correctly that the church of christ is present and operative in the churches and ecclesial communities not yet fully in communion with the catholic church on account of the elements of sanctification and truth that are present in them
8099621 for where two or three are gathered together in my name there am i in the midst of them

8099624 some parents and religious sectors came to me asking if i could come up with an ordinance banning tabloids in the province these materials are available in the newsstands and our children can easily avail of these if we allow them to read such articles and stories its like we are producing potential rapists
8099625 the tabloid really has sex stories in it and the contents are not really meant to be read by children i do not understand why we have to accept those materials here for a christian province with christian people that is unacceptable
8099626 if we have this ordinance in our province our police will have to take action on this matter even without the vrb they will be mandated to do that
8099627 penghulu segala bulan adalah bulan ramadhan dan penghulu segala hari adalah hari jumaat

8099632 i requested for a copy of the accomplishment report from the secretariat because i want to react and correct the gross misappreciation of the report but to my surprise i was not given a copy and was told to wait for the secretary when finally i was able to contact the secretary through phone i was informed that there is a standing order from the office of the vice governor
8099633 i asked the secretary why i was not given a copy she told me that they need a go signal from the office of the vice governor i was puzzled do i have to make an official letter to the vice governor to get a copy
8099634 what i cannot reconcile is that the report was already made public and it was already shown during the regular session i was given a run around by our staff the secretariat who is supposed to assist us in the performance of our duties and functions
8099635 do we have to request or not why did they make me wait for a long time if they would also give me a copy
8099636 this bond would move our facilities forward supporting staff in accomplishing our primary goal of educating our students it would bring significant upgrades to our existing facilities and more permanent structures rather than portables we would build a new gym and aquatic center at gunn a performing arts center at paly and library expansions at some elementary schools

8099687 over the last eight years your lives are less secure over the last eight years you are more likely to have lost your health insurance over the last eight years you are more likely to not be able to save over the last eight years your home values have started to drop
8099688 thats the track record those are the facts and john mccain is not promising to do anything different than george bush did so if you think that the last eight years have been good then you need to go ahead and vote for john mccain but if you think that we need to change this country fundamentally then i think that you need to get involved in this campaign and help us bring about the kind of change that americas looking for

8099695 budak ini tidak suka bicara mari kita masuk ke dalam lobang ini untuk memeriksa
8099696 ciu toako tolong kau lindungi guruku serta menjagai budak ini
8099697 pergi kau menggantikan engko ceng supaya ia datang ke mari
8099698 dia ini tentu lagi hendak membuka besi itu lantas ada orang yang hendak membokong dari belakang
8099699 yang di tanah itu karena tulang tulangnya pada patah mestinya diserang dengan tangan kosong
8099700 aku juga menduga demikian hanya duduknya hal hal disini membuatnya aku tidak mengerti
8099701 dia mengerti ilmu silat lok eng ciang hoat benar ia menyakininya belum sempurna tetapi itu ada pelajaran yang sejati
8099702 dia tidak suka bicara percuma kita menanya pula padanya mari kita memeriksa pula dengan seksama barangkali saja kita mendapati sesuatu
8099703 cio gan keng panglima kota tiongciu gelar bu kong tayhu
8099704 ya inilah patkwa besi kepunyaannya liok chungcu di kwie in chung
8099705 mungkin melihat rusaknya pakaian mayat ini mestinya sudah berada di sini sepuluh tahun
8099706 menurut liok suheng kiok suheng masih hidup siapa tahu dia telah terbinasa di sini
8099707 pernah ayah menerangkan di antara enam muridnya kiok suheng ini paling pandai dan ia pun paling disayangi
8099708 aku sudah lapar aku sudah lapar aku bisa mati kelaparan
8099709 rupanya orang she cio itu menghajar mati suhengmu itu lantas ia hendak membuka peti besi itu
8099710 tidak tahunya suhengmu itu belum mati dan ia menimpuk dengan golok itu
8099711 rupanya pernah ia melihat golok ini sekarang dia tidak ingat
8099712 ayahku pengumpul semua permata dan barang kuno tetapi apa yang ia peroleh tidak ada satu sepersepuluh dari harta karun ini
8099713 kenapa kiok suheng ada demikian lihay hingga ia dapat memeproleh semua ini
8099714 he keluar kamu semua mari kita pergi ke rumahnya kaisar untuk dahar wanyoh ngo tin kwee
8099715 kalau kita berlambat aku khawatir aku tak dapat bertahan lebih lama pula
8099716 paling cepat juga baru besok pagi kita dapat masuk ke dalam kota suhu jangan dengarkan ocehannya loo boan tong
8099717 jikalau kau lapar pakailah uang ini untuk membeli beras dan daging
8099718 jikalau kau tidak mau dengar aku lain kali aku tidak mau memperdulikan pula padamu
8099719 tetapi kita datang ke mari untuk bertarung atau untuk pergi ke dapur raja untuk mencari barang makanan dengan menerjang masuk kau membuatnya gaduh dengan begitu mana bisa kau mendapatkan wanyon ngo tin kwee untuk guruku
8099720 wanita di kolong langit semuanya galak galak maka itu juga loo boan tong tidak sudi menikah seumur hidupnya
8099721 habis apa kau sebenarnya orang baik coba bilang kau yang tidak hendak menikah atau si nona yang tak sudi menikah denganmu
8099722 setelah suhu berdiam di hotel nanti aku masak unntuk kamu dahar
8099723 sebentar aku belikan kau beberapa rupa barang bagus untuk kau buat main
8099724 suhu bilang ada serupa barang yang dapat menyembuhkan penyakitnya hanya itu sangat sukar didapatkannya bahkan ia melarang kita menanya barang apa itu biar bagaimana aku hendak berdaya untuk mendapatkannya buat mengobati dia hingga sembuh
8099725 aku tengah memikirkan jalannya tadi sebelum bersantap pernah aku menanyakan keterangan suhu disaat suhu hendak memberitahu tiba tiba ia sadar lantas ia bungkam tapi aku akan berdaya mengorek keterangannya
8099726 di sini kota raja segala menteri luang temponya mereka main minum arak dan pesiar saja rupanya urusan negara mereka kesampingkan
8099727 maka itu ayahku paling jemu semua orang semacam mereka umpama ayah dapat membaca syair ini mungkin ia cari penulisnya untuk menebas tubuhnya menjadi dua potong
8099728 kau tahu inilah buah kalam istimewa dari thayhaksu jie kok po dari tahun sun hie
8099729 ketika itu kaisar hauw cong datang ke mari untuk minum arak dia dapat melihat syair itu dia puji tinggi lalu di itu hari juga ia memberikan pangkat kepada jie kok po karena karyanya itu itulah untuk bagus dari seorang sastrawan maka kenapa jiwi bicara sembarangan saja
8099730 jadi kesokol ini pernah dilihat kaisar maka tuan rumah menutupinya
8099731 coba lihat itu bagian kata kata besok datang kembali dengan sisa mabuk bukankah pada itu ada dua tanda hurufnya yang diubah
8099732 sebenarnya jie kok po menulis besok datang pula dengan membawa sisa arak tetapi kaisar cela itu katanya pandangannya cupat lalu ia mengubahnya yaitu huruf bawa ditukar dengan huruf mendukung dan huruf arak ditukar dengan huruf mabok sebenarnya jie kok po menulis besok datang pula dengan membawa sisa arak kalau kaisar tidak pintar mana dapat ia mengubah itu
8099733 ya apa yang kita lihat dan tak menyenangi mari kita hajar
8099734 ayah pernah menuturkan itu padaku tempo tahun ciauw hin ke 11 di musim dingin gak bu bok difitnah dan dihukum mati oleh cin kwee lalu di lain tahunnya di musim semi han see tiong membangun paseban ini sebagai tanda peringatan dan ia menuliskan syairnya bu bok itu yang terus diukir
8099735 tetapi istrinya pun gagah meski istri itu asal bunga raja bukankah ia telah turut maju di medan perang dan telah memukul tambur untuk mengajurkan suaminya memperoleh kemenangan
8099736 gak hui dan see tiong memang enghiong tetapi mereka kalah dengan kaisar
8099737 bukankah kaisar menghendaki kematiannya dan semua kekuasaannya atas angkatan perang telah ditarik pulang mereka gagah tetapi mereka mesti menerima nasib demikian pengaruh kaisar yang tak dapat ditentang
8099738 benar asal kaisar gelap pikiran yang bertahta dan segala dorna memegang kekuasaan atas pemerintahan tak peduli satu enghiong terbesar ia tak ada gunanya
8099739 pastilah orang orang seperti auwyang sianseng bakal dapat memperlihatkan kegagahan dan kepandaiannya
8099740 apa maksud mereka datang ke lim an ini dan adik kang kenapa ia ada bersama mereka itu
8099741 memang sudah lama aku melihatnya adikmu itu bukan orang baik baik kau tetap membilang ia turunan orang gagah
8099742 baru sekarang kau mengerti kalau ia benar orang baik kenapa dia bergaul sama see tok dan pangeran musuh itu
8099743 wanyen lieh telah mengumpulkan pheng lian houw dan kambrat kambratnya maksudnya untuk mencari surat wasiat gak bu bok maka mau aku menduga surat wasiat itu mesti berada di dalam kota lim an ini sungguh celaka rakyat song kita apabila surat wasiat itu benar benar terjatuh di tangan mereka itu
8099744 hanya sulitnya mereka itu ada bersama si bisa dari barat itu
8099745 memang aku takut terhadap see tok tetapi urusan ada begini besar karenanya tak dapat kita main takut saja
8099746 itulah restoran sam goan lauw yang kesohor nomor satu di kota kita jangan jiwi melewatkan kesempatanmu ini
8099747 baik juga coba suruh mereka bernyanyi menemani kita minum arak
8099748 kau tahu tidak syairnya liu eng itu ada hubungannya sama negara kim yang besar
8099749 di dalam tahun ceng liong dari negara kim yang agung junjungan kita liang telah melihat syairnya liu eng itu yang memuji telaga see ouw karena ini ketika dikirim utusan ke selatan sekalian dikirim juga seorang pelukis buat dia menggambar panorama kota lim an dalam mana dilukiskan juga junjungan kita lagi berdiri bersama kudanya di puncak bukit gouw san kemudian junjungan sendiri yang menulis syair di dalam gambar itu syair yang menguraikan ia membawa angkatan perang ke see ouw dan ia berdiri di puncak ke satu dari bukit gouw san itu
8099750 sayang tak tercapai cita cita junjungan lian membawa angkatan perang ke selatan untuk mendaki puncak gouw san itu meski begitu cita cita itu sekarang akan ditelad oleh anak cucunya cita cita luhur dari junjungan itu terbukti dengan syair yang ia tulis pada sebuah kipas bunyinya kalau gagang kipas ada di tangan maka angin sejuk akan memenuhi kolong langit
8099751 kalau di lain hari ongya yang memegang kekuasaan besar pastilah akan tercapai itu cita cita berdiri di puncak gunung gouw wan
8099752 di sini ada banyak mata dan kuping mari kita minum saja
8099753 mereka minum dengan gembira sekali aku justru akan membikin mereka tidak gembira
8099754 kemudian kita minta ciu toako layani see tok supaya kita leluasa menghadap itu sepasang manusia celaka
8099755 mari kita pulang setelah mengajak ciu toako baru kita satroni pula mereka
8099756 sebentar aku lawan dia dengan kedua tanganku dengan dua macam ilmu silat juga
8099757 see tok itu manusia sangat busuk kalau kau gunai kiu im cin keng untuk menghajar dia kau tentu tidak melanggar larangan kakak seperguruanmu
8099758 aku toh sudah menyakinkan ilmu silat baru tanpa menggunai kim im cin keng itu
8099759 ah pengemis bangkotan barang makanan di sini mana lebih lezat daripada masakannya nona oey
8099760 sebenarnya aku ingin dahar wanyon ngo tin kwee sayang kokinya entah pergi kemana
8099761 yang ada di sini ialah barang makanan biasa ini memang kurang lezat baik besok kita bekuk itu koki dan suruh ia memasaki
8099762 kalau kau tidak gembira pergilah kau bersama anak ceng biar anak yong menemani aku besok malam baru kau datang menyambut aku
8099763 besok aku akan pakai topeng ini untuk menemui raja saudara kwee dan nona oey kamu awasi see tok jangan sampai ia berhasil mencuri surat wasiatnya gak bu bok
8099764 malam itu jangan tempur si tua bangkotan yang berbisa tunggu saja besok lihar aku
8099765 tentu ciu toako tak sabaran dia pun lantas keluar pesiar
8099766 itu paseban di samping air tumpah ialah cui han tong
8099767 siauw ong telah meneliti surat yang ditinggalkan gak bu bok
8099768 juga siauw ong telah periksa surat surat dua kaisar kho cong dan hauw cong mak aitu berani siauw ong memastikan surat wasiat gak bu bok itu mestinya disimpan di sini lima belas tindak di timur cui han tong ini
8099769 di belakang air tumpah ini ada sebuah gua dengan pintunya besi yang terkunci
8099770 surat wasiat gak bu bok mesti di simpan di dalam gua itu
8099771 sekarang siauw ongya minta tuan tuan suka pergi membuka pintu besi itu
8099772 dia membikin banyak berisik bagaimana kalau pahlawan pahlawan raja dapat mendengarnya dengan begitu masih bisakah kita mencuri wasiat

8099774 we grew up with really good delicious southern flavors black pepper fried chicken smothered pork chops peach cobbler coconut cake and coke cola out of the bottle food was a big deal and that appreciation of good food made it an easy gravitation for me into a professional kitchen
8099775 it was the coolest restaurant in town in the late 80s the chef was so inventive i was drawn toward craft of making really good food and i liked the showtime like preparation the food was ready and boom the doors would open up it was like theatre great experience

8099833 my wife saw this beehive shape one day and asked if i could make it into a birdhouse

8099840 i was searching for unique gifts for the college friends i see only once a year when i came up with the idea of red hat birdhouses
8099841 we were all planning to wear red hats for our upcoming get together so i thought matching birdhouses would be fun
8099842 my dad ken bope who lives in maggie valley north carolina loves to work with wood and happily agreed to design and make the houses he crafted them so theyd open underneath for cleaning the birdhouses were challenging but he did a fantastic job
8099843 to make the top of this birdhouse i used the hard hat that i wore for 31 years when i worked at a steel mill
8099844 i built the rest from wood then painted on a face

8099849 what i ended up with was more like a huge bird playhouse the building is 32 inches tall 60 inches long and weighs about 50 pounds it took me about 6 months to make it in my spare time
8099850 retirement has given me more time for tinkering and i particularly like building things from the wood scraps i get for free from home construction sites

8099861 but as constitutional historian charles warren once noted what is most important to remember is the however the court may interpret the provisions of the constitution it is still the constitution which is the law
8099862 written constitutionalism implies that those who make interpret and enforce the law ought to be guided by the meaning of the united states constitution the supreme law of the land as it was originally written this view came to be seriously eroded over the course of the last century with the rise of the theory of the constitution as a living document with no fixed meaning subject to changing interpretations according to the spirit of the times
8099863 originalism is championed for a number of fundamental reasons first it comports with the nature of a constitution which binds and limits

8099970 when you call it the good war you forget this was the worst war ever we wanted to just sort of unwrap it from the gallant bloodless myth and try to deal with what it was really like to be there and have it unmediated by the commentary of experts

8099981 december 2006 was the sixth month in a row that bookstore sales failed to match 2005 levels
8099982 hardly a week goes by without a sales report of a store going out of business or about to do so
8099983 our staff combined has over 100 years of bookselling experience our staff picks are as eclectic as our employees and are books that we think our community will enjoy some are lesser known authors and we offer them at a 20 percent discount to encourage customers to try a new writer or genre
8099984 i am not sure that a pat conroy or a nicholas sparks would have ever become so popular without the ground swell from author signings in local bookstores we are willing to promote someone who is not yet well known we offer books that may warrant stocking only one or two copies but we are willing to carry small quantities to offer our customers choices
