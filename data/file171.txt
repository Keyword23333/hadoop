1710000 with all the lipstick you put on it its still a pig
1710001 it is still a media campaign for the company to get people to sign their leases
1710002 everyone wants their charge to last a little longer and the duracell my pocket charger and powersource mini will provide the personal power insurance every road warrior needs
1710003 our portable devices give us the freedom to work communicate and be entertained from almost any location these charging solutions extend that freedom when you cant be near a power outlet

1710010 the only people who need to be deported are the members of the ruling parties in washington
1710011 the olympic games represent something powerful that people can come together from around the world and do things that no one thought were possible
1710012 however the denial of my visa is a part of a systemic effort by the chinese government to coerce and threaten athletes who are speaking out on behalf of the innocent people of darfur
1710013 i feel like theres no one out there who would think that its a controversial issue to talk about 400 000 people being killed in darfur right now
1710014 and anybody who says we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1710015 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires
1710016 if conservatives do in fact distribute tire gauges it will one of the most beneficial things theyve done for the general populous in at least the last 28 years
1710017 within a matter of months of ending the federal moratorium on coastal drilling they could be getting additional oil
1710018 note to media are you going to allow mccain to just make up stuff on oil drilling
1710019 a good geothermal energy source has three basic requirements a high thermal gradient which means accessible hot rock plus a rechargeable reservoir fluid usually water and finally deep permeable pathways for the fluid to circulate through the hot rock
1710020 we believe we have found a way to map and quantify zones of permeability deep in the lower crust that result not from volcanic activity but from tectonic activity the movement of pieces of the earths crust
1710021 what brought me to the point of filing this lawsuit was the ill advised attempts by certain legislators to prevent the filing of certain lawsuits
1710022 widespread death destruction and terrorization of millions upon millions of the earths inhabitants
1710023 despite my most sincere zealous efforts i could not find a location to serve the defendant
1710024 after one president in the pocket of the oil companies we cant afford another
1710025 remember that when george bush took office he had an energy policy he turned to dick cheney and he told cheney go take care of this
1710026 obama told a crowd at a gym in youngstown ohio
1710027 john mccains taking a page out of the bush cheney playbook
1710028 i think he might be a little bit confused because when the energy bill came to the floor of the senate full of goodies and breaks for the oil companies i voted against it senator obama voted for it
1710029 people care not only what you say but how you vote
1710030 his schedule hasnt been set for next week let alone next month
1710031 americans overall are better off because we have had a pretty good prosperous time with low unemployment and low inflation and a lot of good things have happened
1710032 voight is obviously entitled to say and write whatever he wants
1710033 but its only natural that industry based obama supporters will henceforth regard him askance
1710034 its out of line to insinuate that we should blacklist people for speaking their minds
1710035 its a strange thing when people in this country cant express their opinions without being attacked
1710036 its an important time for people on the conservative side to speak out
1710037 i dont want to make a big deal out of this i made some very strong points and you do expect that people are going to respond to it in a variety of ways and thats how it should be
1710038 you have to feel it on some level and i was feeling as strong about politics as i was about some movies
1710039 as i started feeling more comfortable with the subject it became easier to punch out i started having fun and it got some real rises out of people
1710040 i have to explain to people that it isnt just one realm anymore everything is bleeding into everything else
1710041 theres a political undercurrent to everything now even mamma mia got made because meryl streep saw the play a month after 9 11 and loved the way it lifted the audiences spirits she wrote a letter to producers and that got the ball rolling for the movie version
1710042 time has come for the liberals to show the right wing how pleasant life is when you are being shunned for your political views
1710043 i was not surprised but i certainly was grateful for his and his familys efforts
1710044 i have a lot of arab business partners i do a lot of business in the middle east ive got a lot of friends
1710045 i ask my friends to support candidates that i think are worthy of supporting they usually come through for me
1710046 sen obama has said expanding our nuclear power plants quote doesnt make sense for america unquote
1710047 he also says no to nuclear storage and no to nuclear processing i could not disagree more
1710048 supports safe and secure nuclear energy however before an expansion of nuclear power is considered obama thinks key issues must be addressed including security of nuclear fuel and waste waste storage and proliferation
1710049 i saw sen obamas latest attack has to do with oil and campaign contributions
1710050 i think he might be a little bit confused because when the energy bill came to the floor of the senate full of goodies and breaks for the oil companies i voted against it sen obama voted for it people care not only what you say but how you vote
1710051 the public the victims families and law enforcement would like to know that the book is closed on this investigation
1710052 what we learn will not change the fact that this has been a poorly handled investigation that has lasted six years and already has resulted in a trail of embarrassment and personal tragedy
1710053 i want a stinky blue cheese for myself and a light manchego for my afternoon escapades
1710054 we respect freddie ljungbergs position and are pleased we could reach agreement and wish him all the best in the future
1710055 i gave my all at west ham and enjoyed my time there but the decision is the best for the both of us now i will take my time to consider my football future
1710056 he knows the areas he needs to work on but on the whole i would have no hesitation in putting him into the team in the premier league
1710057 hes got a very good chance to be one of the best goalkeepers in the premier league
1710058 ive brought in another experienced goalkeeper jan because richard wright leaving has left us a little bit short there but weve all got really high hopes for marek
1710059 it isnt true to say thaksin shinawatra is selling manchester city
1710060 he spoke with executive chairman garry cook this morning and those were the sentiments he echoed in very strong terms
1710061 im quite optimistic and im convinced that he is going to carry on with us
1710062 he is a sporting player and thats it there have been plenty of rumours this summer and an offer was made but we rejected it because it wasnt interesting for the club
1710063 with moutinho in our team we have a great squad with many chances to win the league i believe our team is better than last year and we mustnt weaken it
1710064 that is one of the ones you can believe in the papers
1710065 and he intends to make it a memorable and trend setting event
1710066 reducing drug costs through greater market competition promoting prevention efforts encouraging testing targeting communities with high infection rates strengthening research and reducing disparities through effective public outreach
1710067 we must also overcome the stigma that surrounds hiv aids a stigma that is too often tied to homophobia
1710068 being one of the smaller clubs and thats no disrespect to us but i think once the bigger clubs start moving then the market tends to follow and things move on
1710069 one or two of the bigger clubs now have spent money and it just filters along then and the market starts moving
1710070 porque se perdoardes aos homens as suas ofensas tamb m vosso pai celeste vos perdoar se por m n o perdoardes aos homens as suas ofensas tampouco vosso pai vos perdoar as vossas ofensas
1710071 so far as we know this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever charged in this country
1710072 it highlights the efforts of the justice department to fight this pernicious crime and shows that with the cooperation of our law enforcement partners around the world we can identify charge and apprehend even the most sophisticated international computer hackers
1710073 while technology has made our lives much easier it has also created new vulnerabilities this case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results consumers companies and governments from around the world must further develop ways to protect our sensitive personal and business information and detect those whether here or abroad that conspire to exploit technology for criminal gain
1710074 these prosecutions demonstrate that through coordinated commitment the united states secret service and the department of justice will penetrate and prosecute hacker organizations wherever based and however sophisticated the united states attorneys office for the southern district of california is especially gratified that the work of the san diego field office of the secret service contributed to an unprecedented effort to dismantle this international criminal enterprise
1710075 computer hacking and identity theft pose serious risks to our commercial personal and financial security
1710076 hackers who reach into our country from abroad will find no refuge from the reach of u s criminal justice
1710077 technology has forever changed the way commerce is conducted virtually erasing geographic boundaries
1710078 while these advances and the global nature of cyber crime continue to have a profound impact on our financial crimes investigations this case demonstrates how combining law enforcement resources throughout the world sends a strong message to criminals that they will be pursued and prosecuted no matter where they reside
1710079 the internal revenue service criminal investigation division recommends charges in numerous types of financial crimes
1710080 todays indictment is the result of a strong law enforcement partnership that brings together the necessary skills to follow alleged criminal activity from cyberspace to bank accounts we are committed to the governments efforts to stop this type of corruptive activity
1710081 i told the korean president i am concerned about north koreas human rights record
1710082 i am concerned about its uranium enrichment activities as well as its nuclear testing and proliferation its ballistic missile programs and the best way to approach and answer those concerns is for there to be strong verification measures and that is where we are in the six party talks
1710083 if he is off the state sponsors of terror list i want to remind you they will still be the most sanctioned country in the world
1710084 and so then the fundamental question is do they want to continue on and try to change the status do they want to change their isolation do they want to enter the community of nations do they want to be viewed as a peaceful country
1710085 my hope is that the axis of evil list no longer exists
1710086 thats my hope for the sake of peace and it is my hope for the sake of our children
1710087 i have been meeting with chinese leaders now for 7 1 2 years
1710088 and to the extent that people arent able to do that and people arent able to worship freely is i think a mistake and i explained it to them every single time
1710089 the philippines is one of the countries hard hit by poverty and hunger in the asian region
1710090 to build resilience and contribute to global food and nutrition security in the longer terms
1710091 you need a lot of information to outline an appropriate response you cannot launch something from thin air without planning and design
1710092 high food prices plunged them deeper into poverty and make them more vulnerable to its effects the crisis creates drastically increased levels of poverty and hunger
1710093 in a study by the asian development bank a 10 increase alone in the price of rice causes an additional 660 000 people in the poverty rate
1710094 like a tsunami the wfp has somehow foreseen this the food crisis but everything came up very quickly leaving the vulnerable most harmed
1710095 when food is expensive poor families tend to cut meals and substitute less nutritious foods those who live in rural areas sell their buffalos or oxen just to earn their keep more children withdraw from school as well
1710096 the wfp has provided food security needs of vulnerable populations living in conflict affected areas
1710097 we make the children take home food rations to share with their families
1710098 that is why the president is hastening the implementation of the national social welfare program so that government can help the poorest of the poor
1710099 we are defending islam and its sanctity this is the country we were raised in why should we stand by while our men are defending the country
1710100 the americans took my husband they destroyed our home weve got nothing were living by the grace of god we will not stay silent and everything including bombings we can do in response
1710101 violence by u s or iraqi forces will lead in many cases to grudges and a wish to take revenge especially when husbands are killed i think this is one of the main reasons for female bomb attacks
1710102 female suicide bombers cost little provide ease of planning and are relatively free of risk to terror organizations there is little chance that security forces will obtain sensitive information from them
1710103 we hope that more women will join us in this work
1710104 we are helping our brothers to protect the new iraq
1710105 we crossed a number of scientific barriers in this case
1710106 i came to join the candlelight protest to send a message to bush that he cannot push around weaker nations like a bully
1710107 as koreans have more and more beef on the market i think theyll become more and more comfortable
1710108 the majority of the korean people are eagerly awaiting your visit
1710109 and of course those people along the motorcade route were those who were sort of opposed
1710110 i enjoy coming to a free society where people are able to express their opinions
1710111 hes still the most important figure in global politics and president lee needs support from such an important figure right now
1710112 such mutual clarification can pave the way for a speedy and transparent negotiating process with a bright prospect
1710113 the republic of iran is ready to provide a clear response to your proposal at the earliest possibility while simultaneously expecting to receive your clear response to our questions and ambiguities as well
1710114 the second phase of negotiations can commence as early as possible if there is such willingness
1710115 our offer is clear and their response is not clear
1710116 the iranian government needs to respond in a very clear way to the generous offer from the international community
1710117 its a stalling tactic reiterating that they have goodwill but not answering the exam question
1710118 to be fair to the iranians they do this kind of thing rather well
1710119 i dont see any reason to believe that the russians and the chinese are any more willing today to support really tougher sanctions against iran
1710120 how many more years of this do we have to have before we have comprehensive reform how many more postvilles do we have to have
1710121 you know who is in charge now the gestapo agents at the department of homeland security they are in charge
1710122 i think it is election season and they have decided it did not work for us one way with comprehensive reform so lets try to exploit it politically another way
1710123 how many more years of this do we have to have before we have comprehensive reform how many more postvilles do we have to have
1710124 you know who is in charge now the gestapo agents at the department of homeland security they are in charge
1710125 i think it is election season and they have decided it did not work for us one way with comprehensive reform so lets try to exploit it politically another way
1710126 there were four of them they were big what could i do
1710127 to allow a number of people to protest simply because it would be embarrassing to have these parks standing empty
1710128 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1710129 we should not be paying for iraqi projects while iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank including outrageous profits from 4 a gallon gas prices in the u s
1710130 the era of u s funded major infrastructure projects is over
1710131 accurately highlights that iraqs revenues have grown substantially in recent years
1710132 still needs to improve the speed and effectiveness of its budget execution and the transparency of its budgeting and accounting practices
1710133 we estimate that the iraqi government could spend between 35 3 billion and 35 9 billion of its overall 49 9 billion budget
1710134 continuiamo a lavorare intensamente per migliorarci ha detto il mister per domani mi aspetto una partita dai ritmi diversi rispetto a quella giocata con il portogruaro dove cerano condizioni climatiche impossibili per noi dopo i giorni trascorsi in austria mi aspetto cos una progressione della velocit e pi idee messe in campo contro i greci cambier qualcosa rispetto allultima uscita ma non perch proveniamo da una sconfitta i cambi sono naturali fanno parte del lavoro di gruppo perch dobbiamo trovare il miglior affiatamento possibile
1710135 i have always maintained from day one that i will run this club prudently
1710136 we had a terrible situation in 2002 when i took over and the club was 24 hours away from administration
1710137 there is competition for places which drives you on until you are at the stage when you are not needed then you have to move on
1710138 ive not felt like that but who knows what the future holds or when your time is up at united
1710139 the manager decides that or if you feel you are not helping the team or playing enough games then it is time to go
1710140 but until that time comes im going to work hard and take every disappointment and use it as a fuel to get into the team
1710141 there are one or two scandinavian clubs speaking to rade and well look at that
1710142 weve had one or two calls about some of our players in the last few days and i think therell be one or two of our players moving out even if theyre on loan
1710143 thats something we have to look at because we have a decent number of players and as a professional footballer youve got to look to be playing games so there are options that well put to the players
1710144 dunia adalah perhiasan dan sebaik baik perhiasan adalah wanita sholihah
1710145 id still like to strengthen and im confident well bring in at least two possibly three more faces
1710146 and if those players are of the quality of the likes of jonas gutierrez and danny guthrie then well take our chances
1710147 add to that all the players weve got to come back then weve got a strong quality squad with competition for places
1710148 a political maneuver to distract from his record of supporting george bush 90 percent of the time
1710149 with a little more luck i might have been able to ask you to be my vice president
1710150 deputies found out that adkins had a lengthy criminal history which included similar thefts adkins is currently on parole through the state department of corrections but has failed to report in to his parole officer for several weeks
1710151 its fairly clear that this is being packaged as an extraordinary new kind of fund raising and the internet is a new and powerful part of it
1710152 but its also clear that many of the old donors are still there and important
1710153 this is about barack obama and changing the direction of our country
1710154 we value every donation and every donor equally but we are a performance based organization we want everybody to feel like theyre included but at the same time were not here to have tea together
1710155 its not right to let them get away with this
1710156 its illegal to call 911 when there isnt a legitimate emergency dumbass if they mess up your sub ask them to fix it nicely and they will
1710157 we have been told that the presidents visit to china has been cancelled
1710158 its rewarding to rescue these animals knowing one more life is saved
1710159 holy shit this water is cold and my fingers are raisins
1710160 its kind of like saying theres a bunch of money on the street
1710161 its something the industry is taking seriously youd be in a bad place if you werent doing something about it
1710162 you can bet that the internet providers are going to stay tightlipped about any attacks on their networks
1710163 there might be one or two things that havent leaked yet
1710164 no one should even think they know the subject of the talk
1710165 quite frankly all the pieces of this have been staring us in the face for decades and none of us saw it until dan put it all together
1710166 this is the mother lode all right from the point of view of internet criminals looking for easier access to other peoples money and secrets
1710167 when we went there we found an astonishing amount of gorillas
1710168 this is the highest known density of gorillas thats ever been found
1710169 we know very little about ebola and how it spreads
1710170 we dont even know the animal that spreads it around
1710171 all of these results will be compared to each other along with those of the mummy of king tutankhamun
1710172 we want to find out the truth and facts relevant to the history of these kings
1710173 it is doubtful that it could produce a scientific result to determine such important issues such as the linage of pharaohs
1710174 such announcements are good for publicity they sell well in the media
1710175 goofy thing to do at the end of the day
1710176 its not so much social networking its having a social experience around things that we care about so pets are just such a great example of that
1710177 social networks like facebook and myspace are sort of about you and your friends and these very direct connections but theres all sorts of other types of connections
1710178 theres a lot of people out there with their dogs and were busy and were all working in the office all day long and this is a way for us to bring our pets with us
1710179 its been a goofy thing to do at the end of the day when you get home from work and you just want to talk to somebody in your dogs voice and say hey how was your day
1710180 my dog sits near the computer while i do the work for him

1710196 thats a big negative vote against the yahoo board but it doesnt change anything
1710197 it is a statement that they shouldnt be under any illusion that their support is broad
1710198 the recount somewhat lowers the credibility of the management team
1710199 assuming this was all a mistake it is particularly unfortunate management doesnt have the mandate they appeared to have had
1710200 upon review it was determined that there was a truncation error in the final printout sent to the tabulator
1710201 this resulted in the under reporting of shares withheld for certain directors
1710202 for the next several quarters there is going to be more noise especially with the stock below 20

1710205 its important for yahoos board to understand there is still pressure on them
1710206 i thought yahoos board was kind of let off the hook last week when they didnt really deserve to be
1710207 she said theres a woman on the jury whos quite a bully this womans already decided that hes guilty and that we should go out and see why
1710208 oh yes i heard some of them mentioning that in the jury room
1710209 i conclude from this evidence that there was talk in the jury room about a private visit to watsons bay
1710210 i think that the caller was a member of the jury
1710211 the evidence shows that one or more jurors probably misconducted themselves but as i have explained i am unable to identify any such juror
1710212 the hunting maps have already been published and almost everything is ready for the new hunting season to begin
1710213 during the trial period july 22 to august 3 885 licences have been renewed through the internet
1710214 this shows the simplicity of the new method the new procedure for renewal of hunting licences enables 59 000 registered hunters to renew and print a hunting licence
1710215 even more remarkable the real incomes of working poor families grew six times as fast when democrats held the white house only the incomes of affluent families were relatively impervious to partisan politics growing robustly under democrats and republicans alike

1710218 obama himself voted for a 2005 energy bill backed by bush that included billions in subsidies for oil and natural gas production a measure cheney played a major role in developing mccain opposed the bill on grounds it included billions in unnecessary tax breaks for the oil industry
1710219 there are things you can do individually though to save energy making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that they re talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups you d actually save just as much
1710220 we could save all the oil that they re talking about getting off drilling
1710221 put on a sweater when its cold is being seen here with his tire nflation response and now he is back tracking vero possumus
1710222 ignorant card it has always worked well for democrats like adlai stevenson george mcgovern walter mondale mike dukakis al gore john kerry etc
1710223 i mean im so overexposed im making paris hilton look like a recluse
1710224 as long as he looks o k it dont matter if hes so smart will just do all them those negative lies in attack ads and our stupid nominee will still win the one thing we knows as republicants is that them american people is dumb
1710225 youre going to have a partner in the white house to make sure the auto industry is thriving
1710226 the car inflating idea is stupid most cars mileage dont have anything to do with tire inflation if i inflate my tires will gas go down to 2 bucks a gallon i think not
1710227 when it comes to ignorance and pride were the best
1710228 if republicans are so ignorant then why are they the ones with high paying jobs and pay the highest taxes that support all the social programs that benefit the democrats who are too lazy or ignorant to go out and earn a living
1710229 if republicans are so ignorant then why are they the ones with high paying jobs and pay the highest taxes that support all the social programs that benefit the democrats who are too lazy or ignorant to go out and earn a living
1710230 better to remain silent and thought a fool than to speak and remove all doubt
1710231 if he wants to be a muslim and vote for a muslim
1710232 if everyone inflated their tires 3 4 it would equal all the oil they want to drill
1710233 experts arfe we taling 3 4 of total consumption or just the 5 10 of people riding around on low tires how insignificant is that bhusseino is such an idiot

1710336 your beatitude here is my project to attack the turkish cypriots on the island and eliminate them to the last one 5
1710337 it has been confirmed that during the days following the coup at least 2 000 of makarioss supporters have either been killed in the fighting or executed
1710338 a few days later a terrible smell started suffocating the village
1710339 whenever and wherever the study mission talked with greek cypriot refugees the story was basically the same people moved the instant they saw or thought the turkish army was advancing towards their town or village
1710340 greek cypriots fled the moment there was rumor or sight of military forces creating a virtual vacuum into which the turkish army could and did move without resistance and without the presence of people
1710341 at the first opportunity we get the greek cypriot national guard will attack and regain by force of arms our occupied lands

1710351 we owe the rest of the world 13 trillion rising at the rate of 1 trillion every 15 months
1710352 and the few people who know what is going on dont seem to care
1710353 even though i didnt know him alex wildman i am deeply saddened by this horrible tragedy my heart breaks for alex and his family
1710354 at school i was picked on but not to the extent that alex was and obviously something has to be done
1710355 in the challenge day program leaders go to a school for the day and do activities
1710356 it touched me and i wish we had a program like this here in australia
1710357 they get all the students to stand on one side of the gymnasium and ask if they have ever been bullied for the colour of their skin their height their weight what they wear if they have braces or for being gay the way they talk or the way they walk
1710358 all the students crossed to the other side of the gym and the bullies approached the kids they had picked on with tears in their eyes and apologised
1710359 this is not an anti bullying program but teaches kids to be kind and show love and compassion for one another its what our schools need
1710360 they also have discussions in small groups where they share personal things and open up and its amazing to see the students from all backgrounds and different groups show compassion and love
1710361 whoever is reading this i urge you to look it up its not a usual program it is different and profound
1710362 i think home prices will continue to decline probably until the middle of next year
1710363 i really think the issue of when the economy turns around depends very much on credit markets theyve been very dysfunctional since last august and there are no consistent signs of healing yet
1710364 the fed has a little bit of responsibility for what happened after keeping interest rates too low in 2003 and for not seeing what developed in housing markets in terms of increasing laxity of underwriting standards
1710365 investors around the world were happy to buy sloppily underwritten mortgages so you can blame them too
1710366 you can blame credit agencies for not being on top of their jobs too there is a lot of blame to go around
1710367 the feds behavior in the last six months indicates clearly that officials think the major danger for the economy now is weakness that could accumulate into quite a downward spiral
1710368 i dont think the fed should or will start raising rates until we see credit markets perform better and the economy on a path of growth that can be sustained in the long run
1710369 i dont think well see those conditions until early next year
1710370 so we dont want to see the dollar fall further at the moment
1710371 i think everyone agrees thats necessary on both sides of the political fence including the bush administration and congress
1710372 we have to be careful in adopting new regulations that we dont stifle innovation in financial markets
1710373 but its clear that depending on self regulation and discipline which we have been doing too much is simply not enough

1710377 one of the more interesting presentations that i saw at geoweb was about the creation of a 3d city model for public participation the presentation by j rgen bogdahn of the university of applied science in stuttgart detailed a planning prototype that combined 2d and 3d visualization with comments linked to the map the case study involved noise simulation maps a european union mandated analysis effort with simulation for time of day the interface presented some potential development plans and citizens could comment specifically on the map representation and presentation pinpointing location and allowing search on comments via the map view the system is called the virtual environment planning system and was designed to integrate environmental simulation for noise and flooding impacts to give residents a better knowledge of the environmental impacts the system also gives residents a better understanding of alternate planning proposals and empowers them to provide input the outcome
1710378 yeah but when you go to worship him it is different
1710379 i am so excited and thankful to be blessed with this opportunity i am also a little worried because when i was a little girl i always played h o r s e around the world and any other random game we made up in the driveway with my older sister emmy and i always told her that i would buy her a new car when i became a professional basketball player i really hope she doesnt hold me to that promise
1710380 this has been my dream my entire life to be paid to do what i love and i still cannot believe it has actually came true

1710387 we want blogging on myspace to return to an enjoyable experience for everyone
1710388 we simply want to blog semi peacefully and not be subjected to blog terrorism and bullies who turn on us when we dont follow their rules
1710389 semi peaceful means debates and arguments and acting like normal human beings without launching attacks on each other
1710390 as you see there are lines at the end of my truck including a curved line in front of it and a bonus road cone to let people know that it was not a parking space when i came out i found not one but two people had completely ignored the lines and parked there anyway now i will admit that there was an invitational golf tournament going on the same day but there were numerous people at the reception who said that they had to park quite a distance away these people were not special nor handicapped so they will get no sympathy from me

1710403 there is something mythic about the date of publication and you actually come to believe that on this one particular morning you will wake up to a phone ringing off the hook and your publisher will be so excited that they will have hired the blue angels precision flying team to buzz your squalid little hovel which you will be moving out of as soon as sales of the book really take off or at least they will remember to send flowers

1710435 gradually it was disclosed to me that the line separating good and evil passes not through states nor between classes nor between political parties either but right through every human heart
1710436 such is the debt of free spirits to alexander solzhenitsyn that we owe it to him at least to consider anything he asks us to consider
1710437 the capacity for self deception and self justification is large
1710438 the windfall profits tax is back with barack obama stumping again to apply it to a handful of big oil companies which raises a few questions what is a windfall profit anyway how does it differ from your everyday run of the mill profit is it some absolute number a matter of return on equity or sales or does it merely depend on who earns it enquiring entrepreneurs want to know unfortunately mr obamas emergency plan announced on friday doesnt offer any clarity to pay for stimulus checks of 1 000 for families and 500 for individuals the senator says government would take a reasonable share of oil company profits mr obama didnt bother to define reasonable this extraordinary redefinition of free market success could use some parsing take exxon mobil which on thursday reported the highest quarterly profit ever and is the main target of any windfall tax surcharge yet if its profits are at record highs its tax bills are already at record highs too between 2003 and 2007 exxon paid 64 7 billion in u s taxes exceeding its after tax u s earnings by more than 19 billion that sounds like a government windfall to us but perhaps were missing some business subtlety maybe obama has in mind profit margins as a percentage of sales yet by that standard exxons profits dont seem so large exxons profit margin stood at 10 for 2007 which is hardly out of line with the oil and gas industry average of 8 3 or the 8 9 for u s manufacturing excluding the sputtering auto makers if thats what constitutes windfall profits most of corporate america would qualify the fun part about this game is anyone can play jim johnson formerly of fannie mae and formerly a political fixer for mr obama reaped a windfall before fannies multibillion dollar accounting scandal bill clinton took down as much as 15 million working as a rainmaker for billionaire financier ron burkles yucaipa companies this may be the very definition of windfall the point is that what constitutes an abnormal profit is entirely arbitrary it is in the eye of the political beholder who is usually looking to soak some unpopular business in other words a windfall is nothing more than a profit earned by a business that some politician dislikes and a tax on that profit is merely a form of politically motivated expropriation its what politicians do in venezuela not in a free country
1710439 most criticism of john mccains decision to follow the bush administrations lead and embrace offshore drilling as the answer to high gas prices has focused on the accusation that its junk economics which it is
1710440 it seems like that obama should be miles ahead of mccain when you consider the political climate americans can no longer stand president bush or the republican party or the war in iraq and of course theres the deteriorating economy obama has run a pretty flawless campaign
1710441 o ne big question for obama now is how long can he continue to take the high road with mccain increasingly on the attack
1710442 t he biggest problem john mccain is facing in this campaign is the hard right of his own party which is trying to pin him into positions that are not really very realistic right now
1710443 the racial fantasy factor in this presidential campaign is out of control it was at work in that new yorker cover that caused such a stir its driving the idea that barack obama is somehow presumptuous too arrogant too big for his britches a man who obviously does not know his place mr obama has to endure these grotesque insults with a smile and heroic levels of equanimity the reason he has to do this the sole reason is that he is black
1710444 o rganizations like the nra are trying to increase deaths by gun in this country
1710445 why president obamas likely to have a tough four years
1710446 dafydd iwan has always been an inspiration to people throughout wales and beyond i have worked with him on many campaigns including a number involving the peace movement his commitment to wales and the welsh language is matched by his passionate belief in peace justice and human rights
1710447 for the past four years i have worked alongside dafydd in my capacity as vice president of plaid cymru he has played a vital role in the growth of plaid cymru as a dynamic political force in wales dafydd is the link between the grassroots party members and the leadership team and it is essential that he continues this work

1710456 shes totally cool and shes got tattoos all over and she talked to me like we were just friends hanging out
1710457 so im leaving you i think shes in love with me she lived in seattle for a while her friends are in a band have you heard of them no well shes friends with them and she told me not to put this stuff in my hair because it doesnt wash out
1710458 are you his girlfriend ohmygoshyouresocute im this girl i cut his hair

1710460 the kind of movies i watch are definitely guys movies this is departed this is fear this is all those characters times 10
1710461 i did one other cameo in the entourage pilot but i didnt get to do a scene with jeremy piven
1710462 this time its me and piven going at it so it was fun
1710463 people automatically assumed that i was going to really make that movie
1710464 my agent was even crazy enough to try to get jim cameron to direct it
1710465 more than 30 years in the outpatient clinic of the veterans administration at broad and cherry streets
1710466 after retiring she dedicated much of her time as a volunteer for the va and the red cross
1710467 she was survived by her son walter long grand children and great grands quotes in italics are from
1710468 total and watertight explanations as anyone who has worked with victims of paranoia knows are a symptom of that disease
1710469 i wanted to take a fresh look at something that we all use regularly
1710470 so often id hang washing out only to take it in again five minutes later absolutely soaked
1710471 why despite the release of arcgis is arcview 3 x still being used by gis professionals
1710472 en el ciclismo se nos trata m s injustamente que en otros deportes no nos sorprende pasar controles antidopaje estamos acostumbrados sabemos que somos de los deportistas m s controlados

1710475 just last year i paid a dealer here 300 for what i was told was a pristine copy of roger cormans fantastic four when i got back home i called all of my friends and told them to come on over and watch this movie with me only to then find out that id been sold a copy of dolph lundgren
1710476 very dark in a pre harry potter sort of way but as a ufo afficiando i wondered how would you update the witch mountain mythology so that it would then play for todays audiences
1710477 his choice of follow up projects andy pitched disney on the idea of doing a new
1710478 what i meant by that was that i wanted to make a kick ass thrill ride of a movie
1710479 a contemporary action adventure that was heavily steeped in the world of ufos
1710480 a family film that will entertain everyone from 8 to 80
1710481 those two movies really raised the bar when it comes to action films
1710482 and disney to their credit really let us push the envelope when it comes to a family film there are some pretty intense chases amp action sequences in this picture
1710483 escape to witch mountain is a movie that we all loved as kids
1710484 then the designers would produce some sketches and then we would do the attraction in 3 d model form everything was a model first
1710485 we used to have funny jokes about what rides we would add to that park
1710486 im sorry but there is nothing we can do about it
1710487 be very careful then how you live not as unwise but as wise

1710490 cancer is a global issue and we have had support from all over the world but this money is largely from the people of the north east and first and foremost it will benefit the people of the north east
1710491 ive achieved many things during my career in football but im as proud of this achievement as i am of any other in my life
1710492 so if steve isnt working on the tr2n screenplay anymore who is then
1710493 i first performed it in the u k back in 2006 to help get the word out about the fifth book in the artemis fowl series the lost colony disney executive saw the show there and thought that it might play in the states which is why im now aboard this bus
1710494 at one stop they had to open a long closed balcony to accomodate all of the people that turned out
1710495 at another they had to crank out the stands at this gymnasium in order to provide seats for everyone its been great to have this sort of turnout for the tour
1710496 who was not very pleased to learn that he was mulchs inspiration
1710497 ive heard about comic con for years now so i just cant wait to get into the convention center
1710498 ive already warned everyone on the bus that i plan on filling the place up with all of the comic books that ill be buying in san diego
1710499 after that i plan on staying home for a year so that i can then concentrate on writing my next book
1710500 stay in your seats please we have something else to show you folks something that wont be in theaters for another year or so
1710501 i can go to disney and be a director or i can stay here and make history
1710502 we knew that he wasnt just pitching for the film he was pitching for the survival of the group
1710503 put down your pencil and your paintbrush and do it another way
1710504 i had won an oscar for tin toy but i could hardly afford to have a family and disney was dangling a huge amount of money in front of me
1710505 yeah he could have made lots more money at disney
1710506 but these guys were motivated more by what they could do creatively than by how many dollars they made
1710507 we were aware they were trying to steal john away from us
1710508 but john knew we had something important going on here
1710509 but i kept telling than that marriage isnt a fantasy its an adventure which is why i wanted to propose at the adventurers club
1710510 shed read about it on the web and when she told me my immediate thought was that disney couldnt be serious about closing such a unique entertainment i mean no disrespect to those disneyana fans who tried to save mr toad back in 1998 but there are lots of rides out there that are similar to that attraction where you get in you spin and then get out but there is only one adventurers club in the world
1710511 and the first thing that came to mind was compasses that wed send disney company executives this huge pile of compasses which would hopefully get across the whole
1710512 maps are perfect everyones got one or two old ones lying around their house
1710513 so all it would cost for a person to take part in this particular save the adventurers club campaign is postage
1710514 first open the map and circle where you live then draw arrows from your location to where the adventurers club is located because to be honest im not sure that disneys current management team actually knows where the club is i mean they cant seriously have visited this place if theyve now planning on closing the adventurers club down no one whos ever been in that club seen those shows and interacted with that cast could ever bring themselves to shut such a unique entertainment down now take that map and stuff it in an envelope which youll then address to the walt disney company attn robert a iger 500 south buena vista street burbank ca 91521 copyright disney all rights reserved why send these maps to bob iger because hes the one guy at disney whos shown that hes not afraid to reverse course back away from a bad decision i mean look pixar slip away bob was the only executive who could see that disney was making a tremendous mistake there which is why steve jobs so im hoping that if we all send iger maps hell then see the error of his ways bob will realize what a tremendous under exploited asset the adventurers club is after all its the only part of pleasure island that literally has fans all over the planet people who have great affection for real dedication to that particular club and theyll happily continue to spend their money there if disney just smartens up reverses this unfortunate decision and keeps the adventurers club open
1710515 put bob iger on the right path point this man in the right direction send disneys ceo a map and let bob know that you want him to keep the adventurers club open
1710516 project still needs central government approval and shanghai will obey beijings decision
1710517 on theme parks we have ongoing discussions ongoing and ongoing and ongoing with the chinese government about a park in shanghai
1710518 to date our discussions have been with shanghai officials and now were talking with the national officials
1710519 and why is chinas central government willing to spend this sort of money on shanghai disneyland
1710520 disney will provide technology and capital for a 51 percent stake in a joint venture with shanghais government backed lujiazui group company which will contribute land near the pudong international airport
1710521 i was standing with a few thousand other people watching the parade go by and i realized that there wasnt a character in that parade that had come from a disney animated film in the last 10 years except for pixar
1710522 now betsy this generator produces a harmless electrical charge just like the static created when i rubbed the balloon with that flannel cloth after i start the motor ill ask you to touch the silver ball and the charge will go harmlessly through you and cause your lovely blond hair to stand straight up are you ready
1710523 now touch the metal ball just there and watch what happens

1710527 julie used to invite me up to her workshop where she was then working in secret on the lion king shed sculpted all these prototypes for the shows masks and id put them on and then move about the workroom so that julie would then get some sense as to whether the mask worked or not whether it actually achieved the effect that she was going after
1710528 i still remember how excited julie when she finally figured out how to stage the movies stampede sequence
1710529 she showed me the miniature model of that set how the rollers would turn and gradually reveal all of those wildebeests thundering down into that canyon
1710530 lion king was a musical and i dont do musicals
1710531 i remember taking my daughter with me to the new amsterdam
1710532 and i was amazed as well as intimidated by what i saw this was going to be the first time id ever been a replacement id never stepped into a moving production before i found the whole idea rather daunting
1710533 you basically learn as you go out there in front of the paying customers
1710534 the first time that i was out on stage in front of all those lights i kept thinking how long did i sign on to do this
1710535 she had me try on all these different versions of scars head
1710536 but all i could think about was the size of the contract that disney theatrical had had julie sign while i was in her workshop once she showed me a copy of the thing i remember it being as thick as a phone book never did i dream that 10 years later that id actually be in the show that julie was trying to create then
1710537 not so fast we have higher expenses and we make a lot of flops that devour the hits and besides we take the risk by backing the shows and we just plain think that the current percentage is fine amp dandy
1710538 this is the last best deal we will offer you take it or go on strike
1710539 well gosh we arent ready to strike just yet or even ask our members to approve one we just want to see how the aftra vote comes out
1710540 screw you guys well hire non union actors and the big stars will walk away from you because they like their big paychecks more than they sympathize with a union of 100 000 waiters and shoe clerks who once upon a time got an acting job but have nothing to lose by striking and making everyone else in the business lose their butts

1710564 in the buffalo area alone we had 7 disney stores which is 6 too many to my way of thinking we want these stores to seem special and unique again which is why we have no plans at this time to add any new units to the chain

1710568 that it once again will have a uniqueness and a specialness

1710572 might be concealing drugs weapons or other contraband on her person
1710573 additionally plaintiff collins provides no evidence that strip searches of persons arrested and held at knox county jail was a custom or practice of the defendants in january 2006
1710574 here the corrections officers decision to strip search ms collins was based on the former drug charge in her inmate file the fact that she was self surrendering on an outstanding felony arrest warrant and that she was going to be housed overnight at the jail which like most jail facilities has a problem with contraband
1710575 the court finds that there are legitimate security concerns related to the introduction of contraband which justified strip searching ms collins
1710576 specifically the reasonable justification develops from the fact that ms collins self surrendered to the knox county jail from the community under these circumstances her entrance into the jail was planned and therefore she had the time and the opportunity to secure and hide contraband on her person
1710577 inadvertent occasional casual and or restricted observation of an inmates naked body by a guard of the opposite sex did not violate the fourth amendment
1710578 once plaintiff collins was finished using the bathroom officer reed placed her in her cell and locked the door plaintiff does not allege that reed or any other officers watched her go to the bathroom on any other occasions this limited interaction did not result in a violation of plaintiffs fourth amendment rights

1710580 in the late fifties and early sixties our very own mounties ever conscious of security threats had commissioned research into a mechanical devices for detecting homosexuality inspired by similar research in the united states where mccarthyism and the sex panics had created a market for such lunatic pseudoscience the idea was to unmask perverts by measuring involuntary pupillary dilations and other physiological reactions to pictures and words dubbed the fruit machine by terrified straight mounties who didnt want to be the guinea pigs and whose security was already threatened the technology came in several proposed models one involved perspiratory responses to vocabulary with homosexual meanings like queen circus gay bagpipe bell whole blind mother punk queer rim sew swing trade velvet wolf blackmail prowl bar house club restaurant tea room and top men
1710581 basically theyd show suspected homos slides of naked men and measure their responses dilated eyeballs sweaty palms the poor dilated sweaty souls would then be fired or arrested needless to say the mounties machine was a crock after a decade of breathtaking inaccuracy it was consigned to mothballs
1710582 undecided swing voters are older women focused domestically on the economy and health care and do not feel that either candidate is adequately addressing these issues
1710583 both candidates must be willing to work across party lines to deliver legislative solutions
1710584 the way theyre campaigning now however is not getting it done people want a change not just in the white house but in how washington does business the candidates need to set a tone in this election that doesnt continue to undermine the publics faith and trust
1710585 senators mccain and obama need only to engage the critical voters on the issues of economic security and health care

1710590 your vision is the only thing that youve really got that separates you from anybody else theres probably loads of people who can sing or do music or write or draw the way that you can the only thing that makes you unique is that youre you youve had your experience youve had your life youve got your sort of knowledge so put all of that into what you do make it individual make it unique make it your selling point theres a lot more to it of course theres a lot of boredom grind anxiety but dont worry about that if youre doing what you love even if youre not making any money out of it you are still better off than 99 of the people in this world who are not doing what they love
1710591 basically i just bring them in and work them hard

1710599 i dont have any doubts that on the whole and i think this is a belief universally shared on the team that fallout is a better game

1710601 i have no doubts in my mind that at its core and for everything that it provides that fallout is a better game than oblivion was for sure

1710656 if i dont race nascar im just not going to race im going to race the grand am series or things like that but for me im not going back to open wheel when i stopped in 05 it was because i decided to stop i like nascar and i like the ovals and thats what i want to do

1710662 determined to investigate the design of this extraordinary work of antiquity i prepared myself with necessary requisites for that purpose and decended to the bottom of the cave observing one side to be perpendicular nearly three feet from the bottom i began to inspect that part with accuracy here i noticed a big flat stone fixed in the form of a doar i immediately tore it down and lo a cavity within the wall presented itself it being about three feet in diamiter from side to side and about two feet high within this cavity i found an earthen box with a cover which shut it perfectly tite the box was two feet in length one amp half in breadth amp one amp three inches in diameter my mind filled with awful sensations which crowded fast upon me would hardly permit my hands to remove this venerable deposit but curiosity soon gained the assendancy amp the box was taken amp raised to open it when i had removed the cover i found that it contained twenty eight rolls of parchment amp that when appeared to be manuscrips written in eligant hand with roman letters amp in the latin language

1710668 i apologize for the way it went down but i dont apologize for the passion and intensity i definitely could have handled it a little better but just at that moment thats how it went down i cant take it back the way i handled it probably could have been dealt with better

1710701 i had a passion along with the family support love and interest in doing this when we got back to kabul i took a deep breath and felt pleased that we were done
1710702 the stakes are too high for our representatives to forget as many have that their job is to represent and seek progress for the american people i think john linder was right on term limits and he should honor his pledge as with many of our representatives the longer they remain in washington the further they are pulled from the interests of their constituents
1710703 i dont want to waste money on advertising and marketing it does not work for me
1710704 it was a simple idea that came to us one day
1710705 we were looking at the fact that an entire city that would have their right to own a firearm restored but had very little in the way of instruction or information to work from
1710706 with our first shots program already proven and in place it was obvious that we needed to offer this instruction and training in safe responsible firearms ownership to the residents of washington
1710707 a golden opportunity to offer this instruction and help the citizens exercise the rights the supreme court had affirmed in the heller decision
1710708 we dont want this to be a one time deal
1710709 we want a full push to keep going around the country were going to fine tune in washington and then well move on to other major cities where administrations have been none too keen on firearms
1710710 we crossed a number of scientific barriers in this case
1710711 just remember fans take losses much harder than the majority of players do

1710739 it is well noted we have shown interest we have had discussions with madrid over it and they are ongoing the window is still open and we are still talking to madrid
1710740 one of the key issues over buying robinho has always been that real madrid are looking for a replacement
1710741 it is not true to say thaksin shinawatra is selling manchester city
1710742 he spoke with garry cook this morning and those were the sentiments he echoed in very strong terms
1710743 the player is here and will remain with the team he will start thursdays game against ivory coast in shanghai from the beginning and im sure he can be with us for the rest of the competition
1710744 not at this time no i have spoken with him and he wants to stay here with the rest of the team
1710745 i hope this decision will not have any effects on other teams with players who are coming to this tournament every coach would want messi in their team hopefully barcelona can take the decision that he stays here
1710746 surprised and disappointed by the cas decision but we respect it
1710747 nevertheless i appeal to the clubs let your players take part in the olympics it would be an act of solidarity in perfect harmony with the olympic spirit it would be wonderful for the players for the fans and for the game itself
1710748 fifas opinion has not changed the olympic football tournaments are high level competitions that give everyone involved most notably young players the chance to gain international experience that will stand them in good stead for the future
1710749 it stands to reason therefore that it is not only the player who will benefit from such an experience but also his club i regret that the cas has not taken the olympic spirit into consideration
1710750 we are pleased with the cas decision because we have worked closely with the clubs in this legal matter
1710751 it was always our opinion that under fifa regulations we were not committed to allowing our players to go freely fifa failed to realise the legal implications of this decision early and the preparation of the clubs ahead of the new season has been affected
1710752 it is sad for the athletes concerned they were dreaming of the games but obviously there are some issues between the players and the clubs
1710753 i am not jose mourinho so why compare me with him mourinho says i will win 10 championships but i am more modest than that
1710754 i am from south brazil and in my culture we never say i will win this or that i just say that i will try my best to win all the competitions but mourinho is mourinho he has a different culture to me
1710755 i want to make chelsea loved around the world like barcelona and manchester united its a surprise for me that people say chelsea are unpopular because when we went to china they love chelsea
1710756 there were many people there its a big surprise people dont like us in england here in russia in malaysia its even better but maybe not yet in brazil or south america
1710757 chelsea is a club that is a growing name before it was real madrid barcelona manchester united milan
1710758 if we win one or two big competitions im sure well have fans all over the world maybe it wont be the same as madrid manchester or milan because our history is not the same and you dont make a history in two three or ten years maybe in 20 or 50 years chelsea will be on that level
1710759 since i came to chelsea we have only spent eight million pounds on deco jose bosingwa came in before i arrived
1710760 maybe in the past they have spent more money but now they dont need to spend as much because they already have a solid base now they need a coach to develop young players and i think i am that coach phughes699
1710761 i wasnt so impressed want to grab a coffee and talk about it
1710762 when i was young the early death of my father cast a shadow over me and i was afraid to die before all my literary plans came true but between 30 and 40 years of age my attitude to death became quite calm and balanced i feel it is a natural but no means the final milestone of ones existence
1710763 and so i have come to realise and have personal experience of the fact that world literature is no longer an abstract graph no longer a generalisation constructed by literary experts but a common body and common soul a living responsive unity reflecting the growing spiritual unity of mankind
1710764 what struck me about the scene is the way it undermines the whole cheerful magically unracist future thing you get in sf bradley directly challenges his white boss blithe assumption that he knows whether racism is still around or not as well as the idea that racism could suddenly just disappear one year after being around for centuries we never learn what was supposed to have happened around 1976 was there a eugenics war or was rock against racism more effective than anyone had expected

1710771 certain factors put kids at risk for abuse more than others
1710772 special needs children who are unable to communicate well are often targets also additional stress like caring for too many children or having little experience with your childs age group may make a nanny more prone to abusing or inappropriate discipline instead of choosing a nanny because shes qualified consider if shes qualified for your particular family
1710773 ask if the family would hire her again how she handled emergencies and how prompt she was then implement a trial day so she can get a feel for the neighborhood and you can watch her
1710774 the bottom line is when trusting a stranger in your home with your children you have to go with your gut
1710775 watch how your kids respond to your nanny do they fear her cry when you leave you could always have a neighbor casually drop by to check up on things
1710776 you should never feel guilty for using a camera in your home
1710777 however you must tell your sitter up front that this will happen a good nanny will have no problem with this nanny cam laws vary from state to state so make sure you check your states law
1710778 theres evidence that infants remember abuse later in life and it can impair a childs ability to attach to caregivers and develop trust in the future its always better to be overly cautious than sorry

1710900 the ufcw has said that it intends to either extort bashas into surrendering to its campaign or destroy bashas as a viable business
1710901 in pursuit of that scheme the ufcw and its operatives have repeatedly delivered false and defamatory statements about bashas treatment of its members the health and cleanliness of its grocery stores and bashas regard for and treatment of hispanic customers and employees this ruling allows bashas the right to protect itself from the ufcws extortion

1710969 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
1710970 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
1710971 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
1710972 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
1710973 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
1710974 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that

1710999 general michael hayden who headed the nsa at the time was eager to cooperate and share what his organization had with the 9 11 commission but executive director zelikow was not interested
1711000 why didnt phil zelikow make reviewing these vital nsa documents a commission priority
1711001 it seems clear that not every fact and lead was followed in this investigation compromising the validity of the commissions final report and its findings
1711002 it is abundantly clear that philip zelikow should have immediately been replaced when the first rumblings of his impropriety and conflicts of interest surfaced
1711003 when all of this information became clear the commissioners and the press should have called for zelikows resignation we did shamefully most were silent
1711004 this isnt the first time its turned out that the 9 11 commission wasnt getting the full picture its not even the second

1711024 for nearly a century greenfield laboratories has been an important lilly site currently housing elancos worldwide headquarters and a significant portion of lillys toxicology testing as well as other r amp d support functions
1711025 these actions reflect lillys determination to take the necessary steps to compete in a very challenging marketplace in which our customers are demanding innovative high quality affordable medicines these are difficult but necessary decisions we must make in order to compete successfully as an independent indiana based company
1711026 our longstanding relationship with lilly has delivered innovation in the safety and efficacy testing of new prescription drug candidates and it sets the stage for this landmark agreement through the years we have demonstrated significant success in expediting early development timelines and improving efficiency
1711027 this expanded agreement creates a new strategic paradigm at a time when the pharmaceutical industry needs to challenge traditional thinking in order to improve its r amp d productivity we are confident that this alliance will help create strategic competitive advantages for lilly and allow lilly to strengthen its focus on its core competencies
1711028 we are also very pleased to expand our employee base in central indiana which has a strong life sciences talent pool and has long been a successful home for our global central laboratory and bioanalytical businesses

1711042 this is a completely inadequate deterrent to unscrupulous shop keepers who flout the law to sell these weapons to children and young people
1711043 these tiny fines and a lack of custodial punishment is the wrong signal to those who profit from the illegal sale of knives
1711044 these figures are particularly worrying as they came to light only days after the release of other figures showing 2294 serious crimes in greater manchester area involved a knife in 2007 8 knife crime is 20 of all serious crimes taking place here
1711045 these figures do not record children and young people separately but they do show that knife crime is a serious problem it is too easy for children and young people to get hold of knives too many are being drawn into a culture of carrying and using knives
1711046 liberal democrats believe that the courts must take a much stronger stand against those who are fuelling knife crime by illegally selling knives to children and young people

1711061 liberal democrats in bury are delighted to be able to back national recycling week
1711062 we waste a huge amount of food each year on average we throw away 112kg of food each most of which is still usable
1711063 people should also try to buy food and other goods which have less packaging and full use should be made of recycling facilities to dispose of waste it is better that waste is turned back into something that is useful rather than dumped in the ground
1711064 there is a limit to how much rubbish we can throw into holes in the ground
1711065 these statistics amount to 30 pest control visits per month or 360 per year its a good job they dont run restaurants theyd be closed down
1711066 most kitchen knives have a sharp pointed end which is rarely if ever needed
1711067 health research has proven that many of these knives end up being used as weapons if the government is serious about reducing knife crime then every avenue has to be investigated copyright
1711068 the idea that a mayor could stop the congestion charge was always false and i always thought that local people wouldnt believe it bury lib dems continue to oppose the congestion charge and the council is now free to carry on working hard to get improved public transport for bury without this additional tax
1711069 the issue of the mayor was always about more than the congestion charge a mayor would have meant a less democratic system for local people and would have cost a small fortune every year liberal democrats believe that decisions should be taken in local communities not by one person at the town hall we also believe that tax payers money should be spent on better services and lower taxes not on a big car and a big office for an elected mayor the rejection of the mayor gives us the best chance to continue fighting for real power for local people and better local services for everyone
1711070 i am deeply disappointed that both ivan lewis and david chaytor voted against allowing all mps allowances to be externally audited
1711071 rarely a week seems to pass without a story in the press about mps apparently fiddling their finances the vast majority of mps are not corrupt but so long as they resist having their expenses and allowances subject to robust external audit the public can be forgiven for wondering what they have got to hide
1711072 it is good to see liberal democrat mps setting an example and showing that they have nothing to fear from open independent scrutiny of their expenses
1711073 i hope that the labour and conservative leaderships will follow nick cleggs lead in implementing these measures and we can begin to restore public confidence in politicians
1711074 shrek 2 to reach that milestone warner bros pictures said on tuesday
1711075 that 600 million is kind of one for the ages its held for 10 years
1711076 its very very difficult to get from 500 million to 600 million but the fact were even talking about it tells you something about the strength of the dark knight and what a phenomenon it is
1711077 this government has spent 10 years trying to sound tough while failing to cut youth crime
1711078 in fact ministers have embarked on the mass criminalisation of a generation of young people by dragging more and more young people through the criminal justice system they have reduced the fear of a criminal record and contributed to the problem
1711079 only the liberal democrats propose a dual approach to stop kids from getting involved in crime in the first place and measures to make them face up to the consequences of their actions if they do bury south parliamentary spokesperson vic dalbert
1711080 i think we all recognise that this problem bears all the hallmarks of getting out of hand partially due to the fashion amongst some young people to be seen carrying knives
1711081 but gimmicks and off the cuff policy announcements will not help

1711103 between 16 45 and 17 00 one israeli defense force bulldozer serial number 949623 began to work near the house of a physician who is a friend of ours
1711104 for years the israeli authorities have pursued a policy of discriminatory house demolition on the one hand allowing scores of israeli settlements to be built on occupied palestinian land in breach of international law while simultaneously confiscating palestinian lands refusing building permits for palestinians and destroying their homes the land vacated has often been used to build illegal israeli settlements international law forbids occupying powers from settling their own citizens in the territories they occupy
1711105 any humanitarian looking at the sheer number of innocent civilians who have lost their homes can only condemn israels house demolition policy as a hugely disproportionate military response by an occupation army it is a policy that creates only hardship and bitterness and in the end can only undermine hope for future reconciliation and peace
1711106 one israeli civilian was killed and several injured by rocket fire
1711107 this latest cycle of killings and destruction comes at a time when the 1 5 million inhabitants of gaza are confronting a humanitarian crisis as a result of the increasingly stringent blockade imposed by israel on gaza hospitals and medical facilities already struggling to cope with shortages of electricity fuel equipment and spare parts due to the israeli blockade are struggling to cope with the new influx of casualties caused by israeli attacks in the last few days with gazas borders sealed many patients in dire need of medical care which is not available in gaza cannot be transferred to hospitals abroad and risk losing their lives
1711108 also affirms that the deliberate and systematic killing of civilians and children by the israeli occupying authorities constitutes a flagrant and grave violation of the right to life and also constitutes a crime against humanity
1711109 any humanitarian looking at the sheer number of innocent civilians who have lost their homes can only condemn israels house demolition policy as a hugely disproportionate military response by an occupation army
1711110 also affirms that the deliberate and systematic killing of civilians and children by the israeli occupying authorities constitutes a flagrant and grave violation of the right to life and also constitutes a crime against humanity
1711111 the same commission that condemns israel but only has deep concern for darfur the same commission that has refused to condemn palestinian militants using children as human shields they didnt even condemn rwanda in their previous incarnation
1711112 i condemn palestinian rocket attacks and call for the immediate cessation of such acts of terrorism which serve no purpose endanger israeli civilians and bring misery to the palestinian people
1711113 while recognizing israels right to defend itself i condemn the disproportionate and excessive use of force that has killed and injured so many civilians including children israel must fully comply with international humanitarian law and exercise the utmost constraint
1711114 the kahan commission held him personally responsible for the massacre thats not true the commission determined that the massacre at sabra and shatilla was carried out by a phalangist unit acting on its own but its entry was known to israel no israeli was directly responsible for the events which occurred in the camps sharons worst crime in this incident was being ignorant of the potential danger
1711115 appropriate measures for preventing or reducing the danger of massacre
1711116 101 special commando unit which carried out retaliatory operations following terrorist attacks in israel however the unit remained independent for only five months and was disbanded after it raided the west bank village of kibya killing nearly 70 innocent civilians

1711120 its so hard to deal with every day youre going through something
1711121 i didnt want to do anything i didnt want to come around see anyone talk to anyone everyone would call and say youll be all right id say you dont understand she was there for everything she hated watching me play but she went to games to show support for me i always catch myself thinking about her shes on my mind all the time
1711122 it was big time just a realization that this team is really young and im one of the older guys now ive got to grow up and show a little leadership and get out of the childish age
1711123 now im using that as big time motivation in moving out to right tackle freshman year i proved myself i gained doubters last year i let people down i wasnt playing up to where i should have been and let myself get sloppy
1711124 i would say that the most important thing was that jordan had himself 20 days of continuous practice in spring drills and didnt miss one snap one single drill he was there the whole time and he did very very well against guys that were good players
1711125 i said theres no reason to disrupt this with jason coming back even though hes played hes coming back from injury and having no spring practice i think its important that we let jordan stay there and let joe and jason fight it out if jason does a great job boom we put him over

1711135 it raises some real concerns with the tactics of the nra if theyve got one person maybe they have more if theyve done this dirty trick what else have they done
1711136 to have somebody that i consider a friend have been with dozens of times shared meals with treated as a friend to have her be an employee a subcontracted spy for the nra is just mind boggling its so venal

1711141 the first play was a quarterback draw and i got stood up at the line of scrimmage and then they were trying to rip the ball out thats when i initially injured my thumb
1711142 the next play we did a fake dive with a pitch to larod stephens i think thats where it actually snapped or completely tore off the bone
1711143 i think the redshirt last year will help him out
1711144 hes bigger i know his arms stronger hes more mature hopefully hes smarter but i was very pleased with how he performed and progressed at spring ball coming out of that he was our most complete quarterback
1711145 if you asked me about this right after the surgery id still be pretty down in the dumps
1711146 but youve got to look at the positive side of it i feel the man upstairs has a plan i was able to redshirt and i think that year help me get bigger strong and faster that can only benefit me
1711147 hes got a quarterback feel about him the players rally around him hes really fearless throwing the ball and thats a good thing

1711152 while we expect continued housing and economic weakness will affect our overall performance this year we continue to maintain a surplus over all regulatory capital requirements
1711153 we remain committed to raising 5 5 billion of new capital and will evaluate raising capital beyond this amount depending on our needs and as market conditions mandate

1711165 i suspect that a lot of people are unaware that their identifying information has been compromised

1711175 we are very disappointed that iran has yet again failed to give javier solana a clear answer to the generous incentives package
1711176 we agreed that we have no choice but to pursue further measures against iran
1711177 given the absence of a clear positive response from iran the six countries are discussing next steps in the u n security council and beginning to consider the possible outlines of another resolution
1711178 the letter that we received yesterday appears to be a stalling tactic
1711179 i think that the allies will have no choice but to take further measures that would be punitive given that we dont have a decent and responsive statement from the iranians
1711180 this shows the world that they have no hearts in america
1711181 clearly brett favres popularity in wisconsin has taken an enormous hit over the last several weeks
1711182 they told him well trade you but not within the division
1711183 his first desire was to play here their first desire was for him not to play here
1711184 i just think brett feels like this reporting to packers camp isnt working
1711185 that basically he was not in the right mindset to play here because of all of the things that went on
1711186 mike told me hey were a better team with you on it but wanted to know if i have a problem with an open competition
1711187 i dont have a problem with competing you know that but aaron should be the starter right now because hes been out here all this time
1711188 ill practice my butt off if it comes to that and i think we all know what the end result will be but this probably isnt going to work and i truly understand that if i was in mikes shoes id see it basically the same way he sees it im sure and i think if he was in my shoes hed see it my way i think we both agree on that they want to know if im committed but i want to know if theyre 100 committed the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it stuff has been said stories planted that just arent true can i get over all that i doubt it
1711189 its not as simple as no 4 running out there playing football

1711200 there are many doctors who believe staunchly that psa testing should be done in all men and there are probably an equal number of doctors who believe very much that testing is of limited value
1711201 thats because every 75 year old is not created equal
1711202 very active very vigorous and have minimal health issues and many of those men are going to live into their late 80s or 90s
1711203 it would be a disservice to patients to have their chronological age be the only factor making important health decisions
1711204 there are some very young 75 year olds out there
1711205 feel liberated from having to have the test its one less thing for people over 75 to worry about
1711206 hopefully within the next three or four years we will have some outcomes from those studies and be able to give a little more definitive guidance to men and physicians

1711223 also called noachian laws a jewish talmudic designation for seven biblical laws given to adam and to noah before the revelation to moses on mt sinai and consequently binding on all mankind
1711224 it being one of the seven noahide commandments v gen ix 7
1711225 all of these laws are derived from specific passages in the torah which g d gave to the jewish people at mt sinai
1711226 our rabbis taught seven precepts were the sons of noah commanded social laws 5 to refrain from blasphemy idolatry adultery bloodshed robbery and eating flesh cut from a living animal 1
1711227 i e to establish courts of justice or perhaps to observe social justice nahmanides on gen xxxiv 13 hast dict s v noachian precepts translates obedience to authority
1711228 to establish courts of justice or perhaps to observe social justice translates obedience to authority

1711234 camera applauds rep cantor for reminding cpb of something of primary importance to public broadcasting listeners and viewers not to mention the ultimate stakeholders in this issue taxpayers
1711235 that is that the laws creating the corporation for public broadcasting and providing for federal funding have long required cpb to exercise direct objectivity and balance oversight on behalf of congress and the public its past time that the corporation began upholding its obligation
1711236 public broadcasting law prohibits pre broadcast censorship and it also assumes post broadcast reviews so that chronic violators such as npr national public radio with its middle east coverage routinely biased against israel would be put on notice and if improvement was not made future funding requests would be more closely scrutinized rep cantors reminder to cpb that it must uphold the objectivity and balance requirement is most timely

1711392 there has been a reduction in the number of voters who register with the republican party and a rise among voters who affiliate with democrats
1711393 say the registration numbers may signal the beginning of a move away from republicans that could affect local state and national politics over several election cycles
1711394 this is very suggestive that there is a fundamental change going on in the electorate

1711402 for nearly 50 years the u s government and the nuclear regulatory industry have been trying to figure out what to do with massive quantities of deadly radioactive waste that has been piling up at nuclear power plants and munitions factories since the dawn of the atomic age its sitting in temporary storage facilities many of them near major metropolitan areas vulnerable to accidents environmental disasters and terrorism every possible solution has been explored from dumping it in the ocean to launching it towards the sun president bush the department of energy and the u s congress decided that all of that nuclear waste should be moved to nevada and buried under a mountain in the middle of the desert people in nevada arent crazy about this idea they believe most americans will agree when they find out how the plan might affect them this will be the final resting place for 70 000 tons of highly radioactive nuclear waste beginning in the year 2010 it will be shipped from all over the country by truck or by rail and stored under the mountain in tunnels for the next 10 000 years which is how long the waste will remain deadly

1711410 the threats of weather warfare totalitarian government and famine dovetail together as we saw in the famine which the soviets artificially created in the ukraine prior to world war ii famine is an effective means of subjugating a people by controlling food you can control people weather modification can affect food production and eventually the available supply starving resisters out is much more effective than having to track them down and shoot it out with them if you have not surrendered your weapons you dont get a food ration coupon long term food storage well hidden is the only insulation against famine and totalitarian oppression

1711414 a super powerful radio wave beaming technology that lifts areas of the ionosphere upper layer of the atmosphere by focusing a beam and heating those areas electromagnetic waves then bounce back onto earth and penetrate everything living and dead
1711415 the potential applications of artificial electromagnetic fields are wide ranging and can be used in many military or quasi military situations some of these potential uses include dealing with terrorist groups crowd control controlling breaches of security at military installations and antipersonnel techniques in tactical warfare in all of these cases the em electromagnetic systems would be used to produce mild to severe physiological disruption or perceptual distortion or disorientation in addition the ability of individuals to function could be degraded to such a point that they would be combat ineffective another advantage of electromagnetic systems is that they can provide coverage over large areas with a single system they are silent and countermeasures to them may be difficult to develop one last area where electromagnetic radiation may prove of some value is in enhancing abilities of individuals for anomalous phenomena

1711430 sella park has been an hotel in the past bnfl did a complete refurbishment and we look forward to offering it once again as a fine dining experience with the 11 bedrooms providing lovely accommodation
1711431 its nice that we will have such a grand hotel here for local people and visitors not just the nuclear bossses and vips but we will also be able to offer it for corporate hospitality
1711432 just now we dont know exactly what will happen we want local people to come along and tell us what they think
1711433 we take all customer complaints seriously whether these are made formally or informally to copeland borough council or to the ombudsman i am pleased to see that the number of valid complaints is declining and that no complaints were upheld
1711434 we have recently made some changes to our complaints procedures to ensure that we continue to listen to what our customers are telling us i am pleased that this procedure is working and is reflected in the annual letter from the ombudsman as well as our own customer satisfaction survey
1711435 we welcome complaints as these give us a chance to both put things right for the customer and give us an opportunity to learn from the experience this is happening and the majority of complaints are dealt with at the first stage of our complaints process
1711436 seeing animals slaughtered to be worn as fashion is awful to me so im definitely against wearing fur id much rather go naked than ever put a dead animal on my body
1711437 phelps has earned every bit of the big sponsorship and financial backing he receives because the olympic golds he has won were down to his ability and hard work
1711438 i dont feel any envy over the hype he receives at all
1711439 i have plenty of respect for michael phelps and what he has achieved but im not afraid to get in the pool and race him everyone is beatable be it today tomorrow or in four years time my first aim is to get into the final once youre there anything can happen
1711440 for the amount of work you put in most swimmers except for the likes of michael phelps dont really get the rewards but something like this is fantastic especially for my parents who have put in a lot of work time and money
1711441 we are seeing ssd interest in a variety of applications where historically hard disk drives have reigned for many the most logical place is in notebook computers but there is incredible value for ssds in enterprise server systems
1711442 with our c200 products we are providing a balanced price to performance solution specifically designed for notebook applications by utilizing mlc nand technology and highly optimized nand management algorithms
1711443 the ultra compact surface mount package expands the potential applications for the tps859 which could range from large applications such as flat panel displays and various home appliances to small applications including cell phones and digital cameras
1711444 in addition the new filtering technology and the lower operating voltage improve both the sensitivity and the power saving capabilities of the component
1711445 it sounds like paris hilton supports john mccains all of the above approach to americas energy crisis including both alternatives and drilling paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan
1711446 we are all trying our best to make it true
1711447 the international olympic committee ioc are also working on to solve this problem
1711448 the south korea and dpr korea went to the opening ceremony of olympic games twice in 2000 and 2004 i hope it will happen again in beijing
1711449 the different departments of the beijing police have taken detailed precautions for the olympic torch relay
1711450 we can say we are sufficiently prepared in every way possible
1711451 even though the iranian dropped out there are still a number of strong guys the competition will be no less difficult
1711452 we lost a great star thats true but now we try to find some new faces
1711453 i have said before that i dont think he can do the eight and still believe that
1711454 mind you if there is any person on the planet who is capable it is him its sad but i just dont think it will happen
1711455 but he is going to blow the world away even if he doesnt achieve what he sets out to achieve
1711456 if he achieves say five gold medals the world should salute that he is one of the greatest athletes in the world i just admire his tenacity in everything he does in the pool training out of the pool in everything he has set his targets and pursues them
1711457 beijing olympics home favourite liu ziang top of international talent to watch out for
1711458 to really get a significant impact you are going to have to use purposely grown energy crops
1711459 its really a timing issue with improvements in technology and economics these things will be real in the very near future
1711460 we need energy crops to get the industry to scale
1711461 within the next years we are going to see competitive production costs cellulosic biofuels will be very cost competitive with oil or other sources of biofuels
1711462 technically the only difference is that the content is delivered over the internet but these days there is precious little difference between what the cable wire delivers to your tv set and what it delivers to your pc they are all just digital signals coming from the cloud
1711463 for tyson or asafa to beat usain they would need to have a flawless start and a flawless acceleration phase and still stay relaxed
1711464 it almost seemed like usain had another turbo gear that he hadnt unleashed yet like it was a 120 metre race
1711465 i cant wear sexy gowns or high heels i cant have a boyfriend and i walk like a boy sometimes i get jealous as my female friends go to school while i have to lift weights
1711466 specifically on the 8th the weather in beijing will be cloudy and overcast and we will see some rain showers and thunder showers
1711467 fujitsu advanced technologies ltd is pleased to see that easic is delivering a 45nm product
1711468 this new asic is able to deliver the right combination of performance power and price combined with low up front cost we find the power reduction especially important as we look to add more functionality to our world class ict infrastructure products
1711469 gartner has tracked asic design starts for years and the trend has been unmistakable downward to the right
1711470 leading edge asic design costs have risen to the point where many small to medium sized companies have no choice but to use fpgas new approaches are being developed that lower asic design costs and have the potential to bring the benefits of asics back to the masses
1711471 judging from the magnetic draw we are seeing from the market we are confident that fpga designers asic designers and semiconductor companies will find nextreme 2 to be an irresistible platform for their new designs
1711472 the new asic era of high performance low power and dramatic cost reduction with fast time to market is just beginning and we are already driving a reversal in the trend of declining design starts
1711473 in a market sensitive to power consumption and design cycle time we know that software tools are critical to the success of the project for simple low power designs or sophisticated processor based system on chip solutions the new libero ide 8 4 dramatically simplifies the design process with easy to use tools that identify and reduce sources of power consumption within a design remove tedious design tasks like writing new hdl code for logic functions and make connections between the myriad functions on the fpga or externally
1711474 national instruments data acquisition software for labview ansi c c and visual basic net is used to acquire data from millions of sensors all over the world
1711475 now with ni wi fi daq hardware developers can add wireless sensor capabilities to new and existing measurement applications without having to learn new software
1711476 we must be willing to get rid of the life we planned so as to have the life that is waiting for us
1711477 the big secret in life is that there is no big secret whatever your goal you can get there if youre willing to work
1711478 what college should i attend what major should i choose what do i want to be
1711479 if i dont have written proof of something we have to take for granted the passports that weve seen and have been checked by the ioc are ok
1711480 the ioc relies on the international federations who are exclusively responsible for the eligibility of athletes
1711481 its not the task of the ioc to check every one of the 10 000 athletes
1711482 it is possible that some new faces will compete at the beijing olympics
1711483 today we have absolutely no concerns about the organization no regrets come the 9th of august the opening day of competition the magic of the games and the flawless organization will take over
1711484 while mitch daniels spends millions publicly patting himself on the back taxpayers wont soon forget that his balanced budget was created on the backs of homeowners across this state
1711485 his budget in 2005 not only raised property taxes to the tune of 1 billion he proposed to raise the income tax in 2005 raised the cigarette tax in 2007 raised the sales tax in 2008 and he wants
1711486 after nearly four years of short sighted policies and broken promises hoosier taxpayers are ready to vote this november for protection from mitch daniels and his misguided priorities
1711487 as our economy continues to struggle and as more and more hoosiers join the unemployment rolls each month we are in desperate need of new leadership that has a real plan to rebuild indianas economy and create good paying jobs all across the state i am glad governor daniels has finally responded to my repeated calls for tax relief for hoosiers unfortunately the governors rhetoric doesnt match reality with his plan hoosiers wont be getting a rebate this year the states surplus was built on the backs of working people as a direct result of the increased taxes property cigarette sales and local income taxes that mitch daniels pushed through at this critical time in our states history we need leaders who will act immediately to reverse our downward economic slide and give hard working families a break from the high taxes that this administration has imposed as member of congress i never voted to increase taxes and as indianas next governor i will take that same philosophy to the statehouse i strongly believe with the right priorities and right leadership we can revive this economy keep taxes low and ensure greater economic prosperity for all hoosiers
1711488 we can leverage on our collective expertise to continue to offer a high level of safe and secure flight operations
1711489 we are also finalising the equity shareholding but mae will be the major shareholder in the joint venture
1711490 this is a significant occasion for mae as aeronavali has more than 50 years of experience in mro jobs and is an experienced atr service provider
1711491 we are sure that the new joint venture will produce outstanding results in the malaysian and the regional mro markets
1711492 those guys are talented and theyve worked pretty hard this year
1711493 i honestly think bolt can run 9 6 i think asafa can run 9 6 and a healthy tyson can run 9 6
1711494 some customers handed over more than us57 000 a60 600 each for tickets but received nothing back
1711495 ive been in business for 18 years im aware that theres fraud out there
1711496 confirm that the claim made by the evening standard that he has received a diagnosis of prostate cancer is untrue
1711497 we believe that the evening standards front page story today titled prince philip defies cancer scare is a serious breach of prince philips privacy
1711498 buckingham palace has always maintained that members of the royal family have a right to privacy particularly in relation to their personal health
1711499 for this reason we have always refused to confirm or deny the persistent rumours that circulate about their health particularly during the quieter news months
1711500 we will continue to observe this long standing practice but on this occasion because the damaging story is now being reported widely the duke of edinburgh has authorised us to confirm that the claim made by the evening standard that he has received a diagnosis of prostate cancer is untrue
1711501 we believe there has been a serious breach of the duke of edinburghs right to privacy and we will be taking this issue to the press complaints commission
1711502 we will be asking the pcc to remind all editors of their obligations
1711503 everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private and family life home health and correspondence including digital communications
1711504 editors will be expected to justify intrusions into any individuals private life without consent
1711505 we have been informed that we will be receiving a complaint regarding the duke of edinburgh story over clauses one and three of the code accuracy and privacy but we have not yet received it
1711506 parts of it he acknowledged were quite realistic but then he felt it turned into something that was completely untrue for someone who was actually there that was upsetting
1711507 he wasnt the greatest admirer of americans and it didnt go down too easily that one of them should be playing the starring role
1711508 he felt angry more than angry that hitler had 50 of the 76 escapees shot and my father was friends with seven of them
1711509 i think its stupid because maybe they could have done something more at that time and maybe now its too late to find any clue so i think its very neglectful by the police
1711510 and maybe not even the dutch police but more the british or portuguese police because at that time i remember the police told me they were suspecting the parents themselves
1711511 i thought it was crazy to think that but thats maybe why they didnt do something with it
1711512 she is not my mummy she is a stranger she took me from my mummy
1711513 it seemed that she was together with the family maybe it was not her mother but it could be her aunt or the neighbour and she was not crying or protesting to go with them so i thought it was normal that she belonged to the family
1711514 the girl said she was looking for her mummy and not for her mother she called herself maddie
1711515 at first i thought it was maggie thats why i remember but she made clear it wasnt maggie it was maddie
1711516 if it was madeleine it was a disgrace that it was not passed on
1711517 the most difficult sad and unbearable time that any parent could possibly imagine
1711518 i am appealing to you as a fellow human being to work with us if possible include us and to remember that we are madeleines parents and have needs
1711519 lack of communication and a void of information particularly as the parent of a missing child is torture
1711520 keep a comprehensive record of everyone who crosses our border
1711521 misusing the data to predict future performance could depress expectations of groups of pupils that have performed less well in previous years
1711522 it is no help to pupils from a particular ethnic group who have not performed well to know that other pupils from the same group nationally have not performed well the priority is to improve the performance of all individuals an if a particular group is underachieving to focus particular efforts on improving its performance
1711523 any data is fraught with difficulties cva is so much better than judging a school just on its raw results or only on its school inspection cva is the best measure we have of knowing how good a school is
1711524 data is only numbers on a page or a spreadsheet on a screen they only measure what has been tested and people only test what they can measure
1711525 we promised to give long term support to areas badly affected by last summers unprecedented floods and carefully considered how each bid from these four areas fitted into their ongoing capital investment plans today i am delighted to announce additional funding for all of them
1711526 our priority last summer was to get funding to the frontline as soon as possible to reduce immediate direct pressures on local authorities revenue budgets staff parents and governors worked tirelessly last summer holidays to make sure that the vast majority of schools opened on time
1711527 i pay tribute to the professionalism of staff in the worst damaged schools who have faced very challenging circumstances over the last year todays funding should give those areas a big boost in addressing the long term rebuilding work and flood defence work
1711528 last years floods were the worst for a generation they affected 48 000 homes and more than 850 schools
1711529 but thanks to the extraordinary efforts of local authorities all children were able to return to classes if not their classrooms last september
1711530 this extra government money is very welcome support for councils who 12 months on continue to work hard to help their communities get back to normal
1711531 the formulation of any lucid sensible serious and honest conclusion
1711532 this includes the most dramatic thing ascertaining whether she is still alive or dead which seems the most probable
1711533 the investigators are fully conscious that their work is not exempt from imperfections they worked with an enormous margin of error and they achieved very little in terms of conclusive results especially about the fate of the unfortunate child
1711534 this is not unfortunately a detective novel a crime scenario fit for the investigative efforts of a sherlock holmes or hercule poirot guided by the illusion that the forces of law and justice can always re establish order
1711535 they could not predict that in the resort they chose to spend their holidays they could place the life of any of their children in danger
1711536 we must also recognise that the parents are paying a heavy penalty the disappearance of madeleine for their carelessness in monitoring and protecting their children
1711537 while it is a fact that madeleine disappeared the circumstances of how this happened is not known
1711538 even if as a hypothesis that gerald and kate could have been responsible for the death of the child it would always be left to explain how where when with what means with whose help they disposed of the body
1711539 in reality none of the suspicions which led to them being made arguidos came to be confirmed later
1711540 it is frustrating beyond words and the worst thing is that all this time madeleine has been let down by this lack of apparent coordination it is one of the mysteries of the whole thing and it is tragic that it should come this late on
1711541 hay razones no s lo para suponer sino para constatar que la econom a va tomando vuelo y que vamos a tener un segundo semestre que va a ser mejor que el primero
1711542 la inflaci n sigue siendo enemigo p blico n mero uno
1711543 when is the appropriate time to wear a fur stole
1711544 we are appalled by this incident and hope the perpetrators are quickly identified
1711545 give instruction to a wise man and he will be still wiser teach a righteous man and he will increase his learning the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom and the knowledge of the holy one understanding
1711546 for you formed my inward parts you wove me together in my mothers womb i will give thanks to you for i am fearfully and wonderfully made wonderful are your works and my soul knows it very well
1711547 if it is really going to make a difference and be done on a significant scale we will need greater flexibility to achieve that
1711548 we should probably not be doing this in the good times when the housing market is buoyant but in a downturn we are very aware of the local economy and are in a position to intervene if the right resources are in place
1711549 that is what local authorities will need to be asking government
1711550 we welcome that as an opportunity to promote sustainability and good mortgage packages that will suit people who are not able to get reasonable mortgage rates elsewhere
1711551 its become an open secret within the medical community that philip has prostate cancer

1711555 this work represents the most promising advance in rare earth permanent magnet processing in many years
1711556 i expect it to revitalize international interest in the development of this important class of engineering materials
1711557 the lord is faithful to all his promises and loving toward all he has made

1711571 den igangv rende sommer har v ret den bedst solgte sommer nogensinde i dansk charterhistorie det g lder for apollo og med stor sandsynlighed ogs for den samlede branche
1711572 p nuv rende tidspunkt har vi solgt 20 procent flere vinterrejser end p samme tidspunkt sidste r
1711573 de skuffede p indtjeningen fordi de brugte for mange penge og de s nkede deres prognose fordi de har t nkt sig at bruge for mange
1711574 uret tikker for de tre selskaber og der er helt benlyst en risiko for konkurs ingen er i sikkerhed
1711575 at ndre deres produktmix og sk re ned p antallet af ansatte vil tage et godt stykke tid og endnu l ngere inden det n r bundlinien og hvis de bliver ved med at tabe penge som nu er chancen for konkurs ukomfortabelt h j
1711576 virksomhederne b r identificere talentet ved at se efter kandidatens b de gunstige og mindre gunstige karaktertr k og man b r observere kandidaten over nogen tid og indhente vurderinger fra hans eller hendes kolleger det kan bidrage til at nuancere f rsteh ndsindtrykket
1711577 n r virksomhederne s ger efter talenter er de optaget af at spotte de udadvendte talenter den slags typer vil ogs v re magtorienterede hvilket ikke n dvendigvis er usundt det er det derimod at disse typer ligeledes vil score h jt p narcissisme
1711578 det er jo helt urimelige roamingpriser og det g lder jo ikke kun for 3 men for alle teleselskaberne ingen af datakort udbyderne fort ller om priserne p en gennemsigtig m de der er let at forst
1711579 allerede om f r vil vi se priserne p data trafik falde markant i udlandet
1711580 vi rapporter vores handler til b rsen men vi rapporterer dem ikke som handler i markedet og det vil sige at b rsen f r rapporteringen og man kan k be den information hos b rsen

1711582 den steurop iske division rapporterede en organisk v kst p 12 pct mens nord og vesteuropa rapporterede u ndrede volumener trods svage markeder i frankrig og england
1711583 markedet voksede kun med 2 8 pct i andet kvartal hvor det lykkedes carlsberg at ge sin markedsandel med 0 5 pct point til 38 1 pct vi tror at sabmiller og inbev mister markedsandele i rusland
1711584 hvad der er foreg et i peter m llers hoved ved jeg ikke men hans udmeldinger er meget uheldige da de p virker aktiekursen
1711585 i den situation banken er i lige nu er det alts vigtigt at man t nker over hvad der kommer ud af munden
1711586 det skulle n digt komme til at handle om at nu vil danmark have endnu en undtagelse derfor skal han finde ud af om skoen ogs trykker i andre lande for ellers f r han det sv rt
1711587 der kan blive tale om at placere iskander missiler og strategiske krigsfly i hviderusland og kaliningrad med mere
1711588 pengene for at deltage er st rre i r end da vi fc k benhavn red var med de stiger n rmest hvert r s jeg vil tro at aab kan tjene mellem 80 og 100 mio kr hvis de sl r sig igennem til gruppespillet
1711589 selvf lgelig afh nger det ogs lidt af om man kan vinde nogle kampe i gruppespillet men bare det at deltage giver kassen og mon s ikke aab har nogle bonusaftaler med sponsorer som bliver udl st det havde vi i hvert fald
1711590 vi har ikke regnet s meget p det men vi kan jo se hvad de andre har f et i pr miepenge sidste r de klubber der har f et det laveste modtog 45 mio kr s det er mange penge vi snakker om men selvom vi er optimister s kommer vi til at ligge i den lave ende
1711591 betydningen ville v re helt enorm det er der slet ingen tvivl om b de konomisk sportsligt og organisatorisk
1711592 det ville v re kanon for dansk fodbold og det ville understrege at vi alts n rmer os de andre den danske liga er slet ikke s d rlig som mange vil g re den til
1711593 vi h ber da at kunne have noget klar i l bet af nogle m neder men hvorn r er umuligt at sige
1711594 det forhold at den ligger der ger i hvert fald usikkerheden om hvorvidt vestas kan fastholde markedsandelen p det amerikanske marked
1711595 vestas kan selvf lgelig igen sl en mulig skuffende oms tning hen med periodeforskydninger men jeg tror ikke at aktiemarkedet helt vil acceptere det selskabet sp nder i hvert fald buen til tredje og fjerde kvartal hvis ikke toplinjen udvikler sig som ventet i f rste halv r

1711616 its the last game just give it all you got i tried to keep battling and as the game progressed i went after them with everything i had
1711617 im going to take two weeks off im not picking up a baseball for a while
1711618 i had a feeling they would come in on me
1711619 because in the first game they were jamming me a lot i was just looking for a pitch to drive
1711620 this teams real special we did a lot of things that no other team has done win 37 games beat the 1 team in the country win the division win the championship this is a great group of guys im going to miss them
1711621 the demigods are always looking to that supreme abode of vishnu
1711622 narayana is the supreme personality of godhead and from him brahma was born from whom shiva was born
1711623 i am the source of all spiritual and material worlds everything emanates from me the wise who perfectly know this engage in my devotional service and worship me with all their hearts
1711624 he who existed before the creation of brahm and who enlightened brahm with vedic knowledge is lord r krishna
1711625 then the supreme person n r yan a desired to create all living beings thus from n r yan a brahm was born n r yan a created all the praj patis n r yan a created indra n r yan a created the eight vasus n r yan a created the eleven rudras n r yan a created the twelve dityas

1711854 what we all know is that he isnt the easiest guy to get along with this late
1711855 vince fumo can be a very difficult and aggravating person
1711856 but that is because he is protecting those most vulnerable citizens
1711857 this is not the way he would have wanted to go
1711858 or the way people who admired him wanted him to go

1711873 i see youre wearing a dress as opposed to those blowzy drab blue jeans i just want to let you know that i approve and support your femininity say how fast can you move in that
1711874 i may be a blowzy slovenly slattern but how can you be drab when youve used a bedazzler to make rainbows all over your blue jeans for the record this makes them more gay but possibly less feminist
1711875 men should politely voice approval and support of women they see who are dressed in a feminine way
1711876 on the nanoscale we have to learn how to work with autonomous components

1711889 to me weight watchers was just something that women did because the women in my life did it
1711890 its the society in which we live dieting is like a girls thing im not saying i believe this consciously but its one of those things built into the psyche of our culture and most dieting products and dieting programs are geared to women
1711891 the bread and butter consumer for most companies is usually women about 35 who are married with children and have 30 to 60 pounds to lose
1711892 i think a certain amount of macho attitude goes into it
1711893 women are more likely to join structured programs with counseling but men may think theyd be perceived as being weak and not able to do it themselves
1711894 you see an athlete like dan marino and hes a real mans man
1711895 having dan marino lose with nutrisystem kind of gave men permission to diet
1711896 women get much more tripped up with snack grazing but men get more tripped up at meal time
1711897 its easier to justify overeating at meal time and men will eat pizza pasta hamburgers or casseroles and think at least the food in general is more healthy if its meal related even if they ate 3 600 calories
1711898 we found again and again that whenever it comes to bouts of overeating men are much less vexed with guilt
1711899 women say i really messed up but men are quickly able to put it behind them
1711900 i think its much more socially acceptable for women to talk about diets to talk about calories
1711901 even if they were equally concerned about it its still a real stigma for guys to whine about weight
1711902 men have their own vocabulary for cutting calories and it does not include the word diet
1711903 women love the word diet but you dont hear men saying my diet starts monday
1711904 men tend to say they need to get in shape
1711905 generally a man has to be obese before he considers himself even a little overweight
1711906 men are oblivious that their weight is even a problem but when they realize it its like the invasion of normandy
1711907 men are problem solvers and very dogmatic about weight loss
1711908 we still see a really strong appeal for atkins with men
1711909 a lot of times women are looking for more community support and engagement whether online or offline
1711910 but men dont say so bob hows it going how can i better support you thats not locker room talk men like meal delivery where theres a simple approach that theyre able to follow
1711911 i was told that a weight loss show would never work that its soft a daytime subject i said what im going to do is take a daytime subject weight loss and im going to prime time it up
1711912 some of the biggest criers on the show have been males
1711913 theyve been as emotional if not more emotional than the female contestants
1711914 i dont think theres ever been a time when men have been more preoccupied with their bodies than today
1711915 i imagine well see an increase of men with eating disorders over the next few years
1711916 men have not yet caught up to women in self hatred of their bodies but were on our way there
1711917 this has been a fantasy of madison avenue for decades how do you get straight white men to consume as many cosmetics and colognes as women do
1711918 if they can get men to be as dissatisfied with their bodies as women are theyll be dancing in the streets
1711919 of course i wanted to look better but that wasnt really what was on my mind at the time because i think for men its socially acceptable to be overweight
1711920 but my sides would hurt when i leaned certain ways and i couldnt walk from the parking lot to a building without sweating

1711925 it is very difficult for tibetans to go to beijing and speak out there so that is why we decided to show the real feelings of tibetans inside tibet through this film
1711926 actually we would be happy about the games but much is being misrepresented china was awarded the games on the condition that the situation in china and tibet would improve
1711927 outsiders may think that the tibetans are treated very well and that they are happy but the truth is that tibetans are not free to speak of their suffering
1711928 for every tibetan there are ten to fifteen chinese the chinese are everywhere in these tibetan areas
1711929 even if i had to sacrifice my life for this message to be seen by the dalai lama i agree and welcome this chance

1711932 as we look at the year ahead we anticipate an increasingly difficult economic environment
1711933 the escalating price of energy the contraction of real estate values and liquidity and confidence issues in the finance sector are creating economic shocks that will likely be felt by the vast majority of consumers in the us as well as in europe and maybe elsewhere
1711934 were seeing dramatic increases in branded display advertising across a number of categories for the first month of q1 09
1711935 financial services were up over 100 per cent year on year consumer packaged goods were up over 150 per cent year on year and consumer beverages were up 170 per cent year over year
1711936 social network sites are still trying to figure out what sort of advertising works tapping into consumers conversations and spreading brand awareness virally has proven more challenging than companies originally thought
1711937 but companies willing to invest in new forms of delivery which have a commitment to quality will prosper

1711950 i once read a book called the montauk project by preston b nichols it describes experiments started in 1943 dealing with invisibility and time travel like the philadelphia experiment they were conducted at montauk on long island and strange things were happening to the animals in the nearby forests some people were affected too there has got to be more info out there about this photograph you photoshop believers better look a little closer
1711951 montauk ny is a well known secret base connected to all sorts of conspiracies ranging from mind control and the cia nazi psychics ufo base the philidelphia experiment invisble assassins star wars etc all hidden under a publicly accessible state park how convenient so no surprise that something like this would be found there
1711952 the montauk project was alleged to be a series of secret united states government projects conducted at camp hero or montauk air force station for the purpose of developing psychological warfare techniques and exotic research including time travel due to scant verifiable evidence to support its existence critics argue the montauk experiment is an unverified urban legend no longer used as a military facility the montauk air force station has been open to the public for several years however public access to the old military building is prohibited

1711967 the languor of youth how unique and quintessential it is how quickly how irrevocably lost l anguor the relaxation of yet unwearied sinews the mind sequestered and self regarding the sun standing still in the heavens and the earth throbbing to our own pulse that belongs to youth alone and dies with it perhaps in the mansions of limbo the heroes enjoy some such compensation for their loss of the beatific vision perhaps the beatific vision itself has some remote kinship with this lowly experience i at any rate believed myself very near heaven during those languid days at brideshead

1711982 en esta ocasi n la aver a era algo mas compleja y afectaba al sistema completo no s lo a fuerteventura sino tambi n a lanzarote
1711983 hechos anunciados desde hace al menos dos a os en que se reclamaba la necesidad de construir una nueva central que pasa por aprobar un plan energ tico que mantiene sin resolver el cabildo insular
1711984 tenemos posibilidades enormes pero ni el cabildo ni el gobierno de canarias resuelven un problema que estoy seguro se volver a repetir porque no existe infraestructura suficiente para proveer de energ a necesaria a la isla
1711985 esta es una situaci n tercermundista que sostiene la inoperancia del gobierno de canarias y la quietud del cabildo insular
1711986 las reuniones y declaraciones son necesarias pero o se pone en marcha este plan o aqu todo son cuentos e historias
1711987 hasta ahora la nica respuesta que hemos obtenido es que est n estudiando el tendido en torno a la localidad de m cher en lanzarote porque inicialmente creen que en esa zona puede estar el problema pero sin asegurarnos nada
1711988 la necesidad de que se modernicen los dispositivos de control las redes y se dote del personal necesario para dar respuestas r pidas y eficaces ante estas situaciones

1711992 defender los intereses de esta tierra en vez de aplaudir los desatinos del gobierno de zapatero porque de lo que se trata no es de asentir con la cabeza s lo por ser decisiones del psoe sino de conseguir los mejores beneficios para canarias
1711993 excluir al archipi lago de esta discusi n roza lo intolerable cuando de los 48 aer dromos que conforman la red nacional el de tenerife sur y el de las palmas de gran canarias se posicionan entre los primeros m s rentables junto al de madrid barcelona palma de mallorca y alicante
1711994 es il gico cuando lo que tendr a que tenerse en cuenta es la importancia estrat gica de stos dentro del territorio y en el caso de canarias no cabe duda de cu l es

1712024 hay pocos ayuntamientos con econom a suficiente y ninguno la tiene saneada por eso tanto las corporaciones locales como los cabildos deben tener claro que este es el margen al que se tienen que ajustar e intentar que la inversi n permanezca o suba

1712141 working together with voltaire to provide infiniband support for oracle real application clusters is an important step forward to helping our customers realize faster performance and greater scalability for their database and linux environments
1712142 according to our research some of the key drivers for infiniband adoption include the increased use of high performance computing in enterprise data centers scaleout database environments and shared and virtualized i o
1712143 this solution expands customers ability to run across larger clusters improving the performance and efficiency of large scale data sets
1712144 our joint customers with oracle in industries ranging from financial services to life sciences to digital media are seeing the performance of their applications increase by as much as 50 versus previous configurations based on ethernet
1712145 enterprise customers need scalable data center solutions that strike a balance between performance and cost to support their mission critical computing clusters
1712146 customers using hp proliant or hp bladesystem servers with voltaire infiniband interconnect technology to run their oracle racs or unbreakable linux achieve significant performance gains and scalability without breaking their budget
1712147 developing new and improved mathematical and computational methodologies will further enable systems developers intelligence analysts biologists and health care workers to implement new methods to detect the expected and discover the unexpected among massive data sets
1712148 fodava seeks to put an improved science base under one portion of the problem how can we transform large complex data sets into reduced computational models or mathematical formalisms that retain the information content while better supporting the human in extracting critical information from the data
1712149 scientific advances here are critical to future advances in the science of data and visual analytics that will keep us safe and provide technological and commercial advances that benefit mankind
1712150 reducing the computation time for an analysis from hours to seconds makes all the difference since data analysis is inherently an iterative and interactive process

1712153 its very challenging because of the heterogeneity of the land surface you need to consider many detailed processes down to the micropores in the soil and its impacts on the evaporation to the atmosphere
1712154 these are very small scale processes that need to be considered on the global scale
1712155 we mainly work on model development based on an understanding of the fundamental processes and then representing those processes using equations
1712156 were interested in many scientific problems but we dont trust the tools that exist now thats why we spend a lot of time improving them
1712157 the reason that environmental scientists are interested in the land processes is very simple humans live in the land

1712162 when the eight hour average ozone concentration near the surface reaches more than 85 parts per billion its harmful to people
1712163 as the temperature goes up and people put more emissions into the atmosphere ozone levels will go up as well by knowing how the climate or land use change can affect the ozone levels people might think about doing something to reduce this harmful effect
1712164 there are more than 100 chemical reactions in the model
1712165 we provide the emission sources for instance nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds and the model performs chemical reactions while calculating the temperature humidity wind speed and other meteorological variables

1712225 between twenty and thirty i gradually became more and more agnostic and irreligious yet i cannot say that i ever lost that indefinite consciousness which herbert spencer describes so well of an absolute reality behind phenomena for me this reality was not the pure unknowable of spencers philosophy for although i had ceased my childish prayers to god and never prayed to it in a formal manner yet my more recent experience shows me to have been in a relation to it which practically was the same thing as prayer whenever i had any trouble especially when i had conflict with other people either domestically or in the way of business or when i was depressed in spirits or anxious about affairs i now recognize that i used to fall back for support upon this curious relation i felt myself to be in to this fundamental cosmical it it was on my side or i was on its side however you please to term it in the particular trouble and it always strengthened me and seemed to give me endless vitality to feel its underlying and supporting presence in fact it was an unfailing fountain of living justice truth and strength to which i instinctively turned at times of weakness and it always brought me out i know now that it was a personal relation i was in to it because of late years the power of communicating with it has left me and i am conscious of a perfectly definite loss i used never to fail to find it when i turned to it then came a set of years when sometimes i found it and then again i would be wholly unable to make connection with it i remember many occasions on which at night in bed i would be unable to get to sleep on account of worry i turned this way and that in the darkness and groped mentally for the familiar sense of that higher mind of my mind which had always seemed to be close at hand as it were closing the passage and yielding support but there was no electric current a blank was there instead of it i couldnt find anything now at the age of nearly fifty my power of getting into connection with it has entirely left me and i have to confess that a great help has gone out of my life life has become curiously dead and indifferent and i can now see that my old experience was probably exactly the same thing as the prayers of the orthodox only i did not call them by that name what i have spoken of as it was practically not spencers unknowable but just my own instinctive and individual god whom i relied upon for higher sympathy but whom somehow i have lost
1712226 i went into town to do some shopping one morning and i had not been gone long before i began to feel ill

1712228 i do not know how long this state lasted nor when i fell asleep but when i woke up in the morning i was well

1712427 aceptar que en lugar de concierto para delinquir el delito ejecutado por los miembros de los grupos paramilitares constituye la infracci n punible denominada sedici n no s lo equivale a suponer que los mismos actuaron con fines altruistas y en busca del bienestar colectivo sino y tambi n burlar el derecho de las v ctimas y de la sociedad a que se haga justicia y que se conozca la verdad pues finalmente los hechos podr an quedar cobijados con la impunidad absoluta entendida por la corte interamericana de derechos humanos como la falta en su conjunto de investigaci n persecuci n captura enjuiciamiento y condena de los responsables de las violaciones de los derechos protegidos por la convenci n americana que se les brindar a por medio de amnist as e indultos medidas que podr an ser tomadas a discreci n del ejecutivo y el legislativo y sin posibilidad de control judicial torn ndose en un imposible la obtenci n de la verdad el deber de recordar y el derecho a saber lo que realmente sucedi en el caso

1712577 may your money perish with you because you thought you could buy the gift of god with money you have no part or share in this ministry because your heart is not right before god repent of this wickedness and pray to the lord perhaps he will forgive you for having such a thought in your heart

1712583 our story began in 2004 when one of us started offering rakeback deals to his friends and relatives for a long time our only advertisement was word of mouth one player telling another about our reliable service and competetive deals

1712585 this includes the most dramatic thing ascertaining whether she is still alive or dead which seems the most probable
1712586 the investigators are fully conscious that their work is not exempt from imperfections they worked with an enormous margin of error and they achieved very little in terms of conclusive results especially about the fate of the unfortunate child
1712587 this is not unfortunately a detective novel a crime scenario fit for the investigative efforts of a sherlock holmes or hercule poirot guided by the illusion that the forces of law and justice can always re establish order
1712588 they could not predict that in the resort they chose to spend their holidays they could place the life of any of their children in danger
1712589 we must also recognise that the parents are paying a heavy penalty the disappearance of madeleine for their carelessness in monitoring and protecting their children
1712590 while it is a fact that madeleine disappeared the circumstances of how this happened is not known
1712591 even if as a hypothesis that gerald and kate could have been responsible for the death of the child it would always be left to explain how where when with what means with whose help they disposed of the body
1712592 in reality none of the suspicions which led to them being made arguidos came to be confirmed later
1712593 it is frustrating beyond words and the worst thing is that all this time madeleine has been let down by this lack of apparent coordination it is one of the mysteries of the whole thing and it is tragic that it should come this late on

1712598 pernah suatu saat agus noor datang ke rumah saya membawa sebuah majalah terkenal matra yang di dalamnya memuat cerpennya agus tidak mengatakan kalau cerpennya dimuat tapi hanya bilang ke saya jon matra matra hati saya jengkel betul ketika itu yang ada dalam pikiran saya adalah bagaimana supaya agus juga merasakan sakit hati saya itu untuk itu saya harus berjuang keras agar menulis yang lebih baik dari agus
1712599 tetapi itu hanya persaingan kreatif di kehidupan sebenarnya kami tetap berteman saya tak punya rokok minta agus dia tak punya kopi datang ke rumah saya dan kami ngopi dan saling berbagi cerita dan ide hal hal seperti ini perlu untuk menyalakan api kreatif yang tidak bagus kalau persaingan itu masuk ke hati dan membuat kedua orang teman saling bertolak belakang pandangan dan malah berseberangan secara pribadi
1712600 yang terjadi persaingan ketat antar teman itu membuahkan hasil semuanya jadi sekarang redaktur budaya media mana yang berani menolak karya raudal marhalim satmoko atau putut
1712601 tetapi sekali lagi secara pribadi dengan faruk saya tetap akrab sebagai teman
1712602 tahun 1987 saya ke pusat dokumentasi hb jassin bersama taufik saya meminta kepada petugas untuk mencarikan file kliping tulisan saya ternyata karya saya banyak di taufik juga meminta kepada petugas untuk dicarikan file kliping karyanya dan ternyata tidak ada taufik kesal sekali ketika itu
1712603 terbukti setelah itu taufik menjadi sastrawan asal riau yang sangat produktif jauh meninggalkan yang lainnya termasuk saya
1712604 tahun 1990 an setiap hari kompas menerima 80 lebih naskah setiap harinya atau lebih 500 cerpen setiap pekannya dan yang dimuat hanya satu
1712605 yang menjadi persoalan kalau baru dua sampai sepuluh karyanya ditolak media dan kemudian patah hati ya sudah tak akan pernah maju tetapi saya kira kalau kita tak berbakat menjadi penulis untuk apa kita memaksakan diri toh masih banyak pekerjaan yang lainnya
1712606 saya membaca karya legendaris dari riau yakni panggil aku sakai karya ediruslan pe amanriza itu novel yang luar biasa penuh kritik sosial tentang penebangan hutan di riau masyarakat adat yang dipinggirkan persoalan kapitalisme dan sebagainya tapi apakah karya itu bisa mengubah semuanya toh semuanya yang diceritakan di novel itu masih terjadi di riau saat ini
1712607 saya tidak membela taufik dan menghujat kelompok hudan tetapi saya tanya kepada teman teman sekalian etiskah dalam kondisi bangsa sekarang ini yang hancur secara ekonomi sosial maupun kultural sementara para sastrawan asyik bermain main dengan kelaminnya menurut saya itu tak etis dan itu yang dikatakan oleh taufik ismail dalam pidato kebudayaannya yang kemudian ditanggapi beragam oleh kelompok pengarang yang suka mengutak atik kelaminnya sendiri dalam karyanya kalau hanya menulis tentang kelamin dan seksual tak perlu seorang pengarang membaca teori budaya dan sosial cukup bayangkan tubuh gadis cantik dengan segala lekuk tubuhnya maka jadilah karya tapi tak mudah menulis karya yang menjadi potret sosial budaya masyarakatnya

1712614 the work of education is giving flesh to embodying form but form is not an arbitrary organizational element one among many rather as every artist knows form is the actual shape of content form is a marshaling of materials in relation to one another it is a setting of boundaries and limits it is a discipline an ordering and a fashioning according to need as we examine the need in the church for a broader more complete and more extensive understanding of education we realize that one way to understand it is as the fashioning of form education in the church means taking those forms which ecclesial life presents to us places in our hands as clay to be molded education is the work of lifting up and lifting out those forms through which we might refashion ourselves into a pastoral people

1712624 the standard objection to dualism was all too familiar to descartes himself in the seventeenth century and it is fair to say that neither he nor any subsequent dualist has ever overcome it convincingly if mind and body are distinct things or substances they nevertheless must interact the bodily sense organs via the brain must inform the mind must send to it or present it with perceptions or ideas or data of some sort and then the mind having thought things over must direct the body in appropriate action including speech but anything that can move a physical thing is itself a physical thing

1712641 in the roman mass there is a frequent exchange between priest and people one morning according to the social action magazine the witness it went like this the lord be with you to which the congregation replied and with you also and so it went until an ecclesiastical technological gremlin did something to the pulpit microphone frustrated the priest said theres something wrong with the mike to which the well trained congregation dutifully replied and with you also there is not only something wrong with him but also with the world noting this i have found deep meaning in the hebrew phrase tikkun haolam repair of the world for surely the world wonderful as it is is broken in his essays emerson said there is a crack in everything god has made i submit that one of the central missions of the unitarian universalist movement is trying to fix these cracks repairing the world and creating the beloved community of love and justice the inner urge to work in the service of this vision i call the prophetic imperative the sewing together of spirituality and social action as a seamless garment

1712646 i dont support agricultural subsidies no matter where they are
1712647 the farm bill 300 billion is something america simply cant afford
1712648 for sure he cant lose missouri and thats in the upper midwest could he lose iowa minnesota and wisconsin and still be elected president yes but i wouldnt advise him to have that strategy
1712649 i dont see any scenario in which mccain can get to the white house without carrying some upper midwestern states
1712650 ive never really understood in all my years why sen mccain has gone out of his way to speak against and vote against policies that are important to the upper midwest
1712651 the upper midwest is crucial in this election and midwestern voters value authenticity they value experience
1712652 i dont think agricultural issues are the only issues midwestern voters care about there are some bigger picture issues broader issues where hes strong
1712653 were employing close to 2 000 people right now in iowa in the wind energy industry
1712654 it does challenge him in states like iowa the no 1 ethanol state
1712655 thats where hes got a problem hes got to find his own voice and so far he hasnt had a voice
1712656 president bush and i just had a good conversation about how critically important ethanol is and how iowa is positioned so well to lead the nation
1712657 i have no idea why john mccain doesnt support it it hurts him in indiana and missouri and ohio and its not the message right now that any of us want to hear
1712658 iowa minnesota wisconsin and perhaps indiana are very important states mccain is behind and hes in danger of falling further behind

1712668 recent data suggested that the slowdown has taken a firmer hold of the economy and the olympics may present some downside risks

1712683 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
1712684 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1712685 first the relative shortage of trained budgetary procurement and other staff with the necessary technical skills is a factor limiting the iraqi governments ability to plan and execute its capital spending
1712686 third violence and sectarian strife remain major obstacles to developing iraqi government capacity
1712687 this substantial increase in revenues offers the iraqi government the potential to better finance its own security and economic needs
1712688 the iraqi government spent only one percent of total expenditures to maintain iraq and us funded investments such as buildings water and electricity installations and weapons
1712689 from 2005 through april 2008 iraq spent about 3 9 billion dollars on these sectors

1712700 its very hard particularly for the lowest paid we cannot afford high food prices look at mealie meal look at the electricity prices this is very serious they take this into consideration
1712701 we dont have a lot of information at this stage what we know is that most employees cannot get to work obviously the no work no pay rule will apply a lot of companies have asked if they can exchange it for another day

1712703 there are no trains running in gauteng obviously due to no staff
1712704 there are very few absent staff and those not here are mostly support staff like cleaners and administration staff
1712705 the difficult issue often one has to deal with in society is whether speech that is tough that is disturbing that may be shocking should be circumscribed
1712706 i think we should ensure that we are able to encourage that kind of open dialogue debate and in each case determine where the line should be drawn appropriately
1712707 im inclined to say people should be allowed to express their view as long as it does not constitute incitement to cause harm
1712708 one of the big problems is that there is a political contestation going on out there
1712709 the commission cant be expected to moderate the public contestation around ideas
1712710 our job is to ensure that people conduct themselves within the constitution and thats what we try and do
1712711 i think theres going to be continued arguments about speech as we move into an election next year
1712712 the concept is about what goes on inside the pint
1712713 the fact that it surges and settles is a point of difference about the product and we thought this could create some intriguing and interesting ideas

1712720 it all started on friday night he came in from the garden and he was just not himself he was drooling and we thought that he had eaten something the next day he was exactly the same
1712721 when we took him to the vet we were shocked
1712722 it was so long that they couldnt get the full stick on the x ray and he had to be transferred after anaesthetic to the royal veterinary college
1712723 because he had had not actually damaged himself too much he probably had gulped it down rather than running around and it jammed down as he hit something
1712724 talking to the vets afterwards they said there are a lot of sticks around that are much much shorter that actually kill dogs if they perforate the gullet or the stomach but we were very lucky
1712725 it is a great honor and privilege to have asked to host our own beyond the pale event at roadburn 2009 since playing roadburn 2007 we could think of no better people to work with on this event than the organizers and promoters of roadburn and the wonderful staff at the 013 roadburn is a completely different experience than the traditional music festival it is a small intimate extremely well organized festival put together by people who love the bands and thrive on creating a unique social vibe where the lines between artist audience and staff are often completely blurred
1712726 2009 also marks the 10th anniversary of our own label neurot recordings what an amazing way to mark our first decade as a label i believe that roadburn and neurosis share a clarity of vision that will result in an amazing experience for us all

1712766 we thought of such an initiative after we came across some cases of child abuse at the child development service unit of imhans the paediatricians of kozhikode medical college wholeheartedly joined us to launch the initiative
1712767 we are coming across more cases of sexual abuses nowadays some children who are brought for unexplained fear or sudden disinterest in studies headache or stomach ache are found to be victims of abuse
1712768 a girl who was brought to us did not allow male doctors to examine her when we investigated further it was found that she was sexually abused
1712769 we will present the module before them and after due consultation will make changes if found necessary

1712966 denying those benefits to a couple whose relationship is genuine is neither a rational nor a proportionate response to the legitimate aims of a firm and fair immigration policy

1713011 im going to be so happy when were out of this hellhole
1713012 if it is really going to make a difference and be done on a significant scale we will need greater flexibility to achieve that
1713013 we should probably not be doing this in the good times when the housing market is buoyant but in a downturn we are very aware of the local economy and are in a position to intervene if the right resources are in place
1713014 that is what local authorities will need to be asking government

1713017 yang nampaknya bertujuan untuk memperkuat fakta fakta bagi usulan gelar pahlawan nasional tapi sayang sekali karena tidak atau sengaja karena topiknya adalah diplomasi menyinggung sisi lain yang gelap dari sikap anak agung gde agung saat bekerjaasma dengan nica belanda dalam periode perjuangan pisik di bali maka buku ini terasa timpang dan cenderung memaksakan penilaian dari satu sisi saja padahal salah satu kriteria pahlawan nasional seperti dikatakan menteri sosial bachtiar chamsyah adalah tidak pernah cacat terus menerus padahal aco manafe seharusnya mengerti situasi sejarah dan perasaan komunitas pejuang bali karena dia pernah kuliah dan tinggal cukup lama di bali unud ditahun 60 an dalam hal keputusan pemerintah soal pengangkatannya maka disini ada sebuah nilai yang tidak pas dan bertentangan dengan norma keadilan dan nilai kepahlawana itu sendiri republik ini berdiri karena perjuangan rakyat dan para pejuangnya baik dari sisi militer maupun diplomasi orang ini memutlakkan kesimpulannya karena merasa ahli dan piawai soal sejarah bayangkan saja jika panglima sudirman tidak berpalagan ambarawa menghantam sekutu sampai mundur sejauh semarang dan lalu bung karnolah yang turun tangan agar jangan sampai tni saat itu menghabisi tentara sekutu yg terdesak dan terkepung itu dihabisi sama sekali inggris dan nica karena terkunci dalam kepungan laskar pak dirman diplomasi dan kekuatan militar bahu membahu menegakkan citra republik ini bung karno sangat bijaksana dg memerintahkan pak dirman untuk melepas kepungannya agar ditingkat internasional kita tidak terkesan pro jepang dan melawan sekutu ini strategi yang jitu gabungan militer dan diplomasi bayangkan juga jika bung tomo tidak berorasi dan rakyat surabaya itu tidak berani melawan tank tank sekutu dengan bambu runcing dan misalnya memilih mengikuti surat selebaran ancaman panglima sekutu jendral mallaby untuk meletakkan senjata kita benar benar jadi bangsa tempe dan 10 november tak akan pernah ada untuk anda ketahui juga bahwa jauh sebelum pejuang pejuang palestia berani menubrukkan dirinya ke tank2 izrael maka manusia indonesa yang bernama arek arek suroboyo itu sudah berani menghadang tank2 sekutu just hanya dg bambu runcing saja 10 november 1945 terroris ya bagi belanda para pejuang kemerdekaan tak lebih daripada teroris tapi bukan kelompok doctor azahari atau nurdin m top yang lenggang kangkung masuk indonesia dari malaysia lalu membunuhi rakyat indonesia melalui jaringannya di indonesia amrozy cs bayangkan juga jika gusti ngurah rai turun gunung lalu menyerahkan senjatanya pada overste termeulen di tabanan palagan margarana tak pernah ada dan manusia bali akan dikenang sebagai manusia penakut dan pengecut yang cuma piawai dalam upacara upakara ritus rutinitas tapi ijinkan saya disini bertanya hati siapa di bali yang tak tergetar jika setiap 20 november nama ngurah rai disebut dan diupacarai di marga jika anda masih ragu sampai disini semoga ratu adil tidak bosan karena bagi mereka yang tak memiliki barang setetes saja rasa patriotisme ini memang benar benar sangat membosankan he he akan saya cantumkan surat jawaban ngurah rai kepada overste termeulen yang merayu rai agar turun gunung dan bekerjasama dengan belanda bandingkan dengan sikap anak agung gde agung yang berkolaborasi dengan kolonial belanda saat itu 18 mei 1946 kepada jth toean overste termeulenb di denpasar merdeka soal perundingan kami serahkan kepada kebijaksanaan pemimpim pemimpin kita di djawa bali boekan tempatnya peroendingan diplomatik dan saya boekan kompromis saya atas nama rakyat hanya menghendaki lenyapnya belanda dari poelau bali atau kami sanggoep dan berdjandji bertempur sampai tjita tjita kita tertjapai selama toean tinggal di bali poelau bali tetap menjadi belanga pertoempahan darah antara kita dengan pihak toean sekali merdeka tetap merdeka dewan perdjoeangan bali i gusti ngurah rai saudara ratu adil yang baik bisakah anda membayangkan bagaimana perasaan para anggota keluarga para pejuang bali baik yang gugur dalam palagan margarana maupun ditempat lain ataukah yang masih hidup mendengar pengangkatan ida anak agung gde agung sebagai pahlawan nasional alas bagaimana jika rai masih hidup dan melihat peristiwa ini mungkin gelar pahlawan nasional beliau kembalikan dengan tulus ichlas mengingat definisi kepahlawan sesuai zaman telah bergeser 180 derajat jika anda adalah salah seorang daripada keluarga mereka maka tanyakanlah kepada yang masih hidup atau siapa saja posisi perasaan mereka pengangkatan anak agung gde agung sebagai pahlawan nasional akan memberikan dampak yang memecah belah komunitas rakyat bali yang gandrung dengan nilai nilai kebenaran dan kepahlawanan ini juga menghina para keluarga pejuang kecuali beberapa penghianat yang pandai berpura pura terjadi anomie antara nilai nilai perjuangan ketidak pastian dan konflik dalam wacana kepahlawanan diantara generasi muda berikutnya akhirnya kita bisa sampai pada kesimpulan yang terasa naif tapi sebenarnya tidak jangan jangan memang ada skenario besar untuk mensplitting rasa kesatuan dan persatuan rakyat bali dan indonesia umumnya yang dilakukan oleh para oportunis sehingga bom bali satu dan dua bisa berlanjut menjadi bom bali tiga yang bukan pisik tapi mental psikologis rakyat bali yang jujur dan lugu itu oleh politician yang tak kasat mata dipaksa untuk memilih antara anak agung gde agung atau ngurah rai ini menjadi amat jelas jika kita perhatikan betapa mandulnya koran koran di bali sampai detik tulisan ini bali post misalnya untuk tidak mengangkat sebuah tulisan artikel pokok yang memaparkan fikiran para cendekiawan dan sejarawannya terhadap pengangkatan anak agung gde agung pahlawan di jalan tol
1713018 bangsa yang besar adalah bangsa yang bisa mnghargai para pahlawannya
1713019 lebih menyedihkan lagi tak ada keluarga ide anak agung yang dihubungi untuk berkomentar
1713020 bahwa barangkali para sejarawan dan peneliti kita yang katanya berkelas dunia tak begitu tertarik dengan pejuang atau patriot yang bertempur di wilayahnya masing masing seperti
1713021 negara kertagama pujasastra bagi prabu hayam wuruk yang ditulis mpu prapanca tak bolehlah menulis siapa ken arok
1713022 rai pejuang sejati dan ide anak agung tak lebih penghianat dan loyalis belanda yang pintar membaca arah angin
1713023 penghargaan presiden tetapkan empat pahlawan nasional baru dalam memperingati hari pahlawan 10 november 2007 presiden susilo bambang yudhoyono menganugerahi gelar dan tanda kehormatan sebagai pahlawan kepada empat mantan jenderal dan seorang sipil
1713024 pahlawan katanya tidak mesti pejuang yang sudah meninggal dan berjasa banyak kepada bangsa indonesia
1713025 ide anak agung gde agung pada awalnya menteri dalam negeri negara indonesia timur nit yang kemudian menjadi perdana menteri nit hingga desember 1949
1713026 apakah kita biarkan saja orang yang dipercaya banyak jasa pada negara ini nyelonong menjadi pahlawan nasional
1713027 ya aku setuju dengan panitia bppp yang memasukkannya kedalam nominasi pahlawan nasional jika penggalan busuk dari riwayat hidupnya ketika dia memerintahkan eksekusi pada para pejuang di gianyar dan sikap anti pejuangnya itu direvisi
1713028 mengapa tidak mungkin saja jika waktu kita undurkan ke 1945 lalu anak agung gde agung kita berikan surat yang mundur tahunnya bahwa dia akan diangkat sebagai pahlawan nasional kelak tahun 2007 alas tanpa surat imajiner inipun beliau sudah diangkat pahlawan nasional
1713029 bagaimana jika aa gde agung menolak misalnya saat itu beliau bersama sahabat dekatnya tentu saja h j van mook masih sangat mengaggumi ratu juliana
1713030 tu masih ingatkah kau saat kita beramai ramai mendaftar jadi sukarelawan sesaat setelah mendengar pidato bung karno trikora 1962 di sman singaraja untuk memaksa belanda mengembalikan irian barat
1713031 o ya ya saat itu bahkan banyak dari kita sampai dua kali mendaftar karena semangat patriotisme yang tinggi
1713032 ya tapi apakah para sejarawan yang kini menjadi anggota bppd maupun bppp pengusulan pahlawan nasional yang mengangkat aa gde agung bersama ketiga orang lainnya sudah lahir
1713033 sudah tapi mungkin masih asyik bermain kuda kudaan dari batang pohon pisang
1713034 tapi bisa juga seangkatan dengan kita bahkan bukan hanya mendaftar terjun tapi sebagai bagian dari para pejuang bersama benny murdani atau gde awet sara bergerilya di rimba irian mencari tentara belanda
1713035 kenapa tidak seorang atau siapa saja yang menghayati perjuangan fisik melawan belanda akan dengan mudah merasakan perbedaan antara pejuang dengan oportunis antara pahlawan dengan pengkhianat walaupun dipupuri dengan berbagaai jasa setebal kerak bumi
1713036 ya ambillah contoh pendapat jenderal purnawirawan rais abin yang malu malu mengkritik sby itu tokoh militer yang pernah memimpin pasukan garuda dua ke timur tengah bahkan dia menyaratkan bahwa pemimpin nasional atau negarawan harus memahami sejarah
1713037 jadi presiden sekertaris negara itu tidak benar benar memahami sejarah
1713038 tapi karena presiden dan sekretaris negara tak bisa disalahkan tugasnya amat sibuk mengurusi hal hal yang jauh lebih penting daripada sekedar pahlawan akhirnya beban tanggung jawab tentu ada pada kelompok bppp itulah
1713039 jika ini berlanjut untuk pahlawan pahlawan yang akan datang selanjutnya
1713040 belum sejauh itu tapi konsekuensi logis dari penentuan gelar pahlawan oleh negara pada aa gde agung adalah akan muncul nama nama jalan bandara atau patung serta bangunan bangunan lainnya misalnya jalan anak agung gde agung disamping jalan ngurah rai patung anak agung gde agung berangkulan dengan patung ngurah rai yang paling mengagumkan adalah penggantian nama bandara ngurah rai dengan bandara anak agung gde agung
1713041 karena misalnya setelah dipilah pilah dan dibandingkan oleh oleh panitia sejarah yang piawai dan pintar pintar itu saya duga kebanyakan mereka adalah phd atau jenderal sejarawan karier yang belum pernah menyaksikan perang maka ngurah rai berusia sangat singkat lahir 1917 gugur 1946 jadi usia cuma 29 tahun jasapun cuma berperang dalam palagan margarana itu saja sedangkan anak agung gde agung dengan menghapus penghianatannya yang tak seberapa dan bisa dimaafkan tak ada manusia yg sempurna bukan cih itu wafat dalam usia hampir 90 tahun sangat berjasa dalam berbagai peristiwa diplomasi dengan pihak belanda sehingga tanpa keikut sertaan anak agung gde agung di kmb republik ini tak akan segera terwujud ngurah rai hanya pahlawan lokal yang memimpin seratus extremist yang lalu mati konyol oleh kepahlawanan serdadu serdadu nica yang kebanyakan terdiri dari bangsa awak dan beberapa pengkhianat pejuang yang membocorkan posisi ngurah rai pada saat terakhir konon tanpa ngurah rai indonesia tetap merdeka tapi tidak tanpa anak agung gde agung he eh
1713042 aku belum selesai berbicara lalu barangkali dibatok kepala para cendekiawan ini sedang terpikirkan untuk mengangkat raymond westerling bersandingan dengan ignatius slamet riyadi sebagai pahlawan pejuang sekalian ross van tonningen penakluk badung tabanan dan klungkung disamping anak agung ngurah denpasar yang pralaya di puputan badung gusti made jungutan patih karangasem penghianat yang membelot kearah pasukan belanda saat perang jagaraga 1848 1849 berdampingan bersama i gusti ketut jelantik pahlawan nasional patih buleleng ida made rai pemimpin perang banjar 1868 sedang kami usulkan sbg pahlawan nasional bersama men blegug dari buleleng berdampingan bersama ketut liarta orang setia dan kepercayaan belanda dan patih buleleng saat mendampingi raja anak agung djelantik padang di buleleng gusti gde rai patih lombok komandan rekrut laskar lombok yang menyerbu karangasem atas perintah jenderal michiel setelah jatuhnya buleleng berdampingan bersama anak agung istri balemas dari klungkung yang membunuh jenderal michiels di perang kusamba atau siapa tahu bahkan sultan hassanuddin pada suatu saat yang tidak lama lagi akan berdampingan dengan aru palaka yang segera diangkat sebagai pahlawan nasional karena jasa jasanya membantu belanda mengamankan perjanjian bungaya sehingga negara menjadi bebas dari pemberontakan partisan bugis makassar yang mengganggu pelayaran voc di laut nusantara
1713043 banyak dan karena telah masuk pada telaah para cendekiawan panitia yang berkaliber internasional dan tak diragukan semangat patriotiknya dalam menelaah peristiwa peristiwa sejarah nasional tak perlu kita ragukan
1713044 cendekiawan dan orang orang apalagi yang amat memahami sejarah tak mungkinlah keblinger tu kita bahkan harus berterimakasih atas kerja keras mereka he he

1713046 setelah sekian banyak diskusi yang tidak seimbang antara kelompok anda dan saya di blog saya
1713047 saya melihat dr djelantik dengan semua fakta yang ada dan melihat aa gde agung dengan semua fakta yang ada juga sedangkan anda hanya melihat dari sudut pandang pribadi sehingga muncul presepsi good guy dan bad guy
1713048 opini yang gegabah sebab fakta bahwa salah satu putri beliau bulantrisna djelantik adalah seorang penari legong senior yang sering membawa nama indonesia keluar negri saja anda tidak tahu maka opini anda kurang berbobot
1713049 sebuah hipotesa yang sederhana dan kontradiktif aa gde agung diangkat pahlawan karena pusat tidak memiliki fakta tentang

1713054 masih pada tahun yang sama banyak penduduk mengungsi akibat intimidasi dan aksi nica yang makin menggila keluarga gusti dari pengastulan mohon suaka di puri singaraja sementara kontak para pejuang dan raja masih terus berlangsung kaum pejuang sering secara diam diam memberikan laporan ke puri singaraja
1713055 beberapa kali saya baca ulang tulisan saya tak saya jumpai bagian dimana saya menganulir ada kemungkinan anda mengira itu pendapat dan penilaian saya pribadi padahal jelas sekedar kutipan kutipan objective dari nara sumber yang dimaksudkan untuk memberikan bahan diskusi yang memadai bagi para bloger dr djelantik misalnya menjadi lebih jelas lagi ketokohannya dizaman kemerdekaan dan sikapnya dizaman perjuangan pisik saat kita menerima sedikit penjelasan dari sdri bulantresna maupun dari isi surat gst ngurah rai saat sebelum puputan margarana apakah lalu dalam diskusi ini selalu harus kita tampilkan bagian bagian yang

1713101 i really liked the energy i saw out there today and the effort we got from the guys i want to see us build off of this momentum in the next few days as we prepare for our first scrimmage
1713102 what were looking for in the next few days is consistency we want to see the guys giving the same effort each and every play every day those are the guys that we are looking to take the field with when we go to savannah state
1713103 well you can look on our website maybe they have a page in english

1713108 we are very grateful for the tremendous start we had in this game
1713109 after the great start i think we played a very very good defensive game and there were very few big chances for the united states
1713110 my glass is always half full so for us its a new experience to lose a game
1713111 im happy that its the first game and not the last so we still have two more games to go and well take out this part the second half for when we play against japan and new zealand

1713120 it is hard for me to separate everything that is happening right now
1713121 to carry the flame is an honor among many that i have had at previous olympics and at this one but it is the kind of experience that i will appreciate most many years from now when i am older and can look back
1713122 i believe it is an honor that will probably go to one of our older olympians or athletes
1713123 why dont you go to the mountain women who make better soup and eat there

1713142 once poland has signed an agreement with the american side on deployment of elements of the missile defense there we will be able to discuss some additional aspects of our military and technical cooperation with belarus
1713143 the russian military are talking of strategic bombers and iskander systems
1713144 probably some actions will be taken albeit without belarus regaining its nuclear status
1713145 the united states believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings
1713146 so america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists
1713147 nargis has shown that if the u s wants to help the burmese people they need to have some kind of relationship with the burmese military government
1713148 than shwe wants to isolate burma if the u s tries to isolate burma they are simply doing than shwes work for him
1713149 i expect them china to be the dominant team in the olympic games for many years to come
1713150 were going to do our best were not used to being an underdog in the olympic games but well get used to that and do our best
1713151 it was not the most opportune to wear a mask
1713152 you never want to go to somebody elses place and cause any embarrassment and i think in this case they did a little bit
1713153 we think its unfortunate that he will not have that opportunity but that is between this government and joey as a private citizen who was trying to make his way to these games
1713154 its unfortunate it would have been good for joey to be here i dont know thats embarrassing to the usoc
1713155 i dont begrudge them china the olympics i think theyll do well with them but there are so many of their governments policies that i find repulsive especially for athletes who have no intention but to help someone else
1713156 we think this is a formidable system that we will have to contend with for a long time
1713157 we look at this as a three country race with russia the u s and china
1713158 it will be a matter of what happens every day of the games you will find medals coming that are a surprise and you will have some disappointments
1713159 a girl who bitches about her roommate so much that all you want to do is shake her and say bitch move out if you dont like it

1713194 the money in stripping isnt as profitable as it used to be this subway was my golden parachute
1713195 the people got up and looked around and saw the mountain lions tail leaving the house
1713196 it is kind of strange for a large predator like that to come that close to the house
1713197 i just saw 2 familiar silhouettes and i also find it amazing since i didnt wear my spectacles and i picked you out among the crowd at the first sight
1713198 its not a terrible thing you want to see that

1713200 whats happening in the market today will not be reflected until next year which is going to be worse from everything weve seen
1713201 if this amendment 5 were to pass in november which i hope it does people will look at that as a lot more than a tweak
1713202 a 25 percent reduction in property taxes not just for homesteads but for second homes for small businesses owners thats more than tweak i would think
1713203 we could be getting sicker were looking for the doctor

1713216 we promised to give long term support to areas badly affected by last summers unprecedented floods and carefully considered how each bid from these four areas fitted into their ongoing capital investment plans today i am delighted to announce additional funding for all of them
1713217 our priority last summer was to get funding to the frontline as soon as possible to reduce immediate direct pressures on local authorities revenue budgets staff parents and governors worked tirelessly last summer holidays to make sure that the vast majority of schools opened on time
1713218 i pay tribute to the professionalism of staff in the worst damaged schools who have faced very challenging circumstances over the last year todays funding should give those areas a big boost in addressing the long term rebuilding work and flood defence work
1713219 last years floods were the worst for a generation they affected 48 000 homes and more than 850 schools
1713220 but thanks to the extraordinary efforts of local authorities all children were able to return to classes if not their classrooms last september
1713221 this extra government money is very welcome support for councils who 12 months on continue to work hard to help their communities get back to normal

1713235 trato de ver a los jugadores norteamericanos cada vez que vienen a china pero esta vez es especial porque se trata de las olimp adas
1713236 pero estados unidos tiene las mejores posibilidades de coronarse campe n
1713237 m s modestia que el ex entrenador de los blues jos mourinho
1713238 no soy jos mourinho as que por qu me comparan con l mourinho dice ganar 10 campeonatos pero yo soy m s modesto que eso
1713239 soy de brasil y en mi cultura nunca decimos ganar esto o aquello s lo dir que tratar de dar lo mejor para ganar todas las competiciones
1713240 pero mourinho es mourinho tiene una diferente cultura a la m a
1713241 desde que llegu a chelsea s lo hemos gastado 8 millones de libras en deco jos bosingwa lleg antes que yo
1713242 tal vez en el pasado han gastado m s dinero pero ahora no necesitan gastar m s porque ya tienen una base s lida ahora necesitan un t cnico que descubran j venes jugadores y yo creo que soy ese t cnico
1713243 alrededor de 50 millones de d lares por a o
1713244 no quiero decir que se trate de mucho ruido y pocas nueves pero creemos que es un poco pretencioso
1713245 en general la liga considera que los jugadores son productos fungibles
1713246 pero lebron es uno de los tres o cuatro jugadores que la liga definitivamente odiar a perder si un equipo lo perder a a l o a kobe bryant en manos de europa perder a la cabeza ser a devastador
1713247 ser a decepcionante perder a una de nuestras estrellas pero estoy seguro de que los mejores hombres no jugar n m s que en la nba durante mucho tiempo
1713248 me sorprender a si uno de nuestro mejores jugadores decide irse a europa pero si eso llegara a suceder hay muchos hombres dispuestos a llenar el vac o
1713249 en primer lugar no sabemos si habr una oferta de 50 millones de d lares
1713250 y en segundo lugar all no podr a lograr las cosas que quiere hacer aqu como ganar campeonatos de la nba convertirse en jmv etc
1713251 were the same three jerks we always were im actually quite proud of the fact that its gone on as long as it has
1713252 im in front of the stage and you literally see people break out into sobs or kiss each other and jump around expressing joy
1713253 when he exercises his right to have it the way he imagined it its a problem for both him and me
1713254 i just cant do it i cant remember it i have my own ideas im incorrigible
1713255 but not really to the extent where we were able to clear up all of our misconceptions about each other
1713256 it was really good for us to figure out what made the band work and what didnt work so we could appreciate each other unconfused by these other issues
1713257 we are the mighty police and we are totally at sea
1713258 as were getting more into it and less uptight about living the legend it is actually becoming the stuff that got us here
1713259 it was the commitment in the beginning that made it possible that it was a finite commitment that has actually made it a lot of fun
1713260 im fully prepared to say that was it were fine and were done
1713261 on the other hand im fully prepared if someone comes back in a couple of years and says we ought to give it a go you have to consider it
1713262 a lot of bands like the eagles and probably numerous other ones everyone sort of matures and they realize that its fantastic business and the impetuosity that comes with being very young and walking away from something that is really successful you kind of get over that
1713263 you want me to come pray for these invisible souls in a metaphysical way when i have a real soul here in the person of mischa barton that needs saving i need to save mischa not the amorphous catholic congregation
1713264 there is also the courage of the writer who braves the kind of censorship that forbids
1713265 it just occurred to me there should be a scout group on facebook it was a bit tongue in cheek to start with it was never meant to have the impact it has
1713266 its like a comfort thing im going to university in october and it will be difficult to stay in touch so it will allow me to keep up with scouting i dont want travel and time restraints to be a problem
1713267 if i see anyone wearing the necker scarf then we stop and talk its a chance to meet people from all over the country as well as other countries and learn about their culture
1713268 if i didnt come to scouts i wouldnt have met all the people i have ive met different people americans swedish nigerians and germans
1713269 we are all scouts were all the same were equal
1713270 im sure baden powell would have loved the idea its all about what he started the movement for its just what scouting is about its about making friends
1713271 written in 1908 by baden powell who last year was voted the 13th most influential person in the uk in the is the fourth biggest selling book in the world after the bible the koran and maos little red book
1713272 to capitalize on this progress the next two rounds of elections provincial races this fall and a national contest next year must go smoothly and be seen as legitimate
1713273 american combat troops are needed to protect polling places from terrorism and even more important from voter intimidation fraud and the perception that the results were rigged
1713274 time warners focus on creating content rather than distributing it
1713275 as we continue to reshape time warner well increasingly focus on our goal to create and manage high quality branded content
1713276 a separation of aol would eliminate whats been a drag on growth and a management distraction
1713277 we look forward to hearing more about structural alternatives there
1713278 some of time warners businesses most exposed to advertising like a lot of the other companies that reported so far did worse on revenue but had other revenue sources like subscriptions to offset that
1713279 doesnt mean national advertisers are not also seeing weakness spill over
1713280 i talk to him all the time and thats not what i heard
1713281 i heard a man who wants to work with the united states to come up with a rational way to have the united states withdraw combat troops depending upon conditions on the ground thats all
1713282 the right timeframe for a withdrawal with the possibility of slight changes

1713285 positive discrimination from the state to prevent the institution from disappearing
1713286 i think most american church goers are the soil that chokes the seed of the gospel because of all the thorns
1713287 has your relationship with god actually changed the way you live
1713288 lukewarm people give money to charity amp to the church as long as it doesnt impinge on their standard of living if they have a little extra amp its easy amp safe to give they do so
1713289 lukewarm people tend to choose what is popular over what is right when they are in conflict they desire to fit in both at church amp outside of church they care more about what people think of their actions than what god thinks about their heart
1713290 lukewarm people dont really want to be saved from their sins they only want to be saved from the penalty of their sins they dont generally hate sin amp arent truly sorry for it theyre merely sorry because god is going to punish them lukewarm people dont really believe that this new life jesus offers is better than the old sinful one
1713291 lukewarm people call radical what jesus expected of all his followers
1713292 lukewarm people rarely share their faith with their neighbors coworkers amp friends they do not want to be rejected or make people feel uncomfortable
1713293 i was a foot from something that was more than scout
1713294 it happened so fast they the two dogs didnt make a peep
1713295 it was pretty bizarre to wake up at 4 a m and find a mountain lion in your bedroom
1713296 it was the best way of knowing we got the right animal
1713297 so whats the big deal whats so great about this
1713298 yeah its overwhelming but what else can we do get jobs in offices and wake up for the morning commute
1713299 weve been doing a lot of sewing these past few months to prepare for this show
1713300 so did you guys see radiohead last night they were pretty awesome right didnt look like they did much sewing though
1713301 will ultimately result in increasing our dependence on foreign oil and hinder investment in domestic exploration
1713302 the development of a battery package that has the size capacity cost and power to leapfrog the commercially available plug in hybrids or electric cars
1713303 we should explore nuclear power as part of the energy mix
1713304 simplify the tax code reward activity in the u s and make us more competitive with other countries
1713305 the p5 1 major powers are discussing next steps in the and beginning to consider possible outlines of another sanctions resolution
1713306 we are very disappointed that iran has failed yet again to give a clear answer to the p5 1 generous incentives package the letter we received yesterday appears to be a stalling tactic
1713307 we havent set any deadlines ourselves for their response and there is ongoing dialogue
1713308 certainly there is a matter which is going to be discussed by the ministers in september
1713309 iran is ready to provide a clear response to your proposal at the earliest possibility while simultaneously expecting to receive your clear response to our questions and ambiguities as well
1713310 we dont have the decent and responsive statement from the iranians
1713311 the question posed is clear and calls for a simple answer does iran accept the freeze for freeze offer to launch negotiations it does not require further clarification
1713312 we regret that iran has once again chosen not to answer clearly despite all the efforts the six have made these past weeks to offer a framework for negotiations
1713313 the german government believes it is important to maintain the unity between the eu3 germany france and britain plus 3 united states china and russia and that this unity is an important recipe for the success of our policy towards iran
1713314 i was not surprised but i certainly was grateful for his and his familys efforts
1713315 i have a lot of arab business partners i do a lot of business in the middle east ive got a lot of friends
1713316 i ask my friends to support candidates that i think are worthy of supporting they usually come through for me
1713317 it is very difficult and is a very logistically intensive business that we have been able to specialize in
1713318 we do difficult logistical things that dont necessarily suit a major oil company its a niche weve been able to occupy
1713319 everything we have done on this contract has been in the best interest of the military and the u s taxpayers
1713320 we strictly follow campaign finance law and where flags are raised well certainly look into it
1713321 a local person but i would like not to talk about it anymore
1713322 im involved in the restaurant business my brother faisel recommended john mccain whenever he makes a recommendation we do it
1713323 why does it matter who im telling you we made the contribution we funneled it through the channel in florida because thats the contact we had i was responsible for collecting it
1713324 was the victim of an act of piracy early this afternoon as it was sailing between somalia and yemen
1713325 as far as we know no shots have been fired

1713327 the ship is indeed the ponant property of the cma cgm group we were informed that there were pirates on board

1713336 i love promotion and i want a job that doesnt require me to sit at a desk all day
1713337 we crossed a number of scientific barriers in this case
1713338 this has been described as the most valuable domestic burglary ever committed in this country the collection is described as priceless
1713339 there is a difficulty in putting a value on antiques and antiquities some of them very precious and very rare but it is tens of millions of pounds
1713340 stands for the making strange of what is familiar and the homeliness of what is strange
1713341 rome will have to do more than to play a waiting game she will have to use some of the dynamite inherent in her message
1713342 an aug 1 style article about rap also misidentified it as music when in reality its just noise
1713343 you cant have a country where everybody lives in a nursing home
1713344 the ability to plan the decision to have a child is of course a big success for society and for women in particular
1713345 but if you would read the documents of demographers 20 years ago you would see that nobody foresaw that the fertility rate would go so low in the 1960s the overall fertility rate in italy was around two children per couple now it is about 1 3 and for some towns in italy it is less than 1 this is considered pathological
1713346 you cant have a country where everybody lives in a nursing home
1713347 we will try to open the last two road junctions on march of the next year
1713348 it was a working farm we had about 40 cattle a few horses and sheep but we were hit hard financially by bse and foot and mouth and we couldnt make enough money to continue
1713349 it was really sad to leave but i thought at least it would be protected because it was listed i am absolutely gutted that it has all gone
1713350 and the cottage at the back of the farmhouse that wasnt touched by the fire so i dont understand why that was knocked down it was over 400 years old
1713351 we knew it was a special building because there were stipulations on it when it came to building i cant believe it has all gone more should have been done to save it
1713352 better to be an intelligent snob than an impartial idiot

1713354 la sombra de balaam el antiguo asesino y falso maestro
1713355 ven pues ahora te ruego mald ceme este pueblo porque es m s fuerte que yo quiz yo pueda herirlo y echarlo de la tierra pues yo s que el que t bendigas ser bendito y el que t maldigas ser maldito
1713356 pero tengo unas pocas cosas contra ti que tienes ah a los que retienen
1713357 y el pueblo empez a fornicar con las hijas de moab las cuales invitaban al pueblo a los sacrificios de sus dioses y el pueblo comi y se inclin a sus dioses as acudi el pueblo a baal peor y el furor de jehov se encendi contra israel y murieron de aquella mortandad veinticuatro mil
1713358 han dejado el camino recto y se han extraviado siguiendo balaam fue un asesino porque con sus ense anzas mat a miles de hijos de israel aconsej a balac premeditadamente
1713359 he aqu por consejo de balaam ellas las mujeres moabitas fueron causa de que los hijos de israel prevaricasen contra jehov en lo tocante a baal peor por lo que hubo mortandad en la congregaci n de jehov

1713664 on tuesday 16th june 1981 as royal ascot opened amid the traditional blaze of pomp and glory and glory lowly stockton staged its final days racing
1713665 prior to the gambling act betting shops could only open in the evenings during the summer
1713666 since september 2007 they have been able to open in winter evenings too and this has led to an increasing demand for races to bet on

1713714 based on current and projected climate signals atlantic basin and u s landfalling tropical cyclone activity are forecast to be about 90 percent above the 1950 2007 norm in 2008
1713715 there is a high about 95 percent certainty that activity will be in the top one third historically
1713716 tsr anticipates the trade wind predictor having a strong enhancing effect on activity and the sea surface temperature having a small enhancing effect
1713717 due to a combination of a very active early tropical cyclone season in the deep tropics and more favorable hurricane enhancing sea surface temperature and sea level pressure patterns in the tropical atlantic
1713718 the primary concern with our current very active seasonal forecast numbers is the continued ocean surface warming in the eastern and central tropical pacific
1713719 although it seems unlikely at this point there is a possibility that an el ni o could develop this fall
1713720 its not unusual at all to have one or two storms in june and a couple of storms in july if were in an above average season its not unusual at all
1713721 its a misconception to think that were going to have an above average season but were still not going to have them storms until the middle of august
1713722 once hurricane season begins we can have a storm just about any time
1713723 the global warming arguments have been given much attention by many media references to recent papers claiming to show such a linkage
1713724 despite the global warming of the sea surface that has taken place over the last three decades the global numbers of hurricanes and their intensity have not shown increases in recent years except for the atlantic
1713725 in the two months since barack obama captured the democratic nomination he has hit a ceiling in public opinion proving unable to make significant gains with any segment of the national electorate
1713726 is a sobering reminder to democrats intoxicated with his campaigns promises to expand the electoral map beyond the boundaries that have constrained other recent party nominees
1713727 it is unlikely a running mate will be selected before the candidate returns from a weeks holiday in hawaii which starts this friday that leaves about 10 days until the start of the democratic party convention in denver
1713728 in addition to michelle obama the candidates inner circle consists of just three people david axelrod his senior strategist david plouffe his campaign manager and robert gibbs a senior adviser all three are intensely loyal and discreet obama professionals
1713729 officially barack obama will deliver an energy policy speech wednesday to citizens in elkhart ind but the focus of the political chattering class will be on the man sitting shotgun at the event evan bayh the indiana senator thought to be on the likely democratic presidential nominees short list of vice presidential candidates
1713730 sen bayh is also a known commodity he was under consideration for the no 2 job and presumably vetted for the position by the previous two democratic presidential nominees al gore and john kerry
1713731 tracking the vice presidential sweepstakes is always an exercise in chasing ghosts but perhaps never more so than in this years campaign those who know whats going on generally dont talk and those who dont know often do leaving hungry journalists to speculate with partial or perhaps even incorrect information about the state of play
1713732 if youve got michelle as first lady and malia and sasha running around on the south lawn that changes how america looks at itself
1713733 among voters younger than barack obama obama leads by 5 points among voters older than john mccain mccain leads by 13 among voters in between their ages mccain leads by 14 among white voters mccain leads by 19 points among black voters obama leads by 68 hispanics favor obama by 60 points mccain leads among both men and women among both college grads and non college grads among both those who earn less than 50 000 a year and among those who earn more than 50 000 a year
1713734 the strategy according to democratic aides pelosi takes the heat on energy policy while behind the scenes shes encouraging vulnerable democrats to express their independence if it helps them politically
1713735 pelosis gambit rests on one big assumption that democrats will own washington after the election and will be able to craft a sweeping energy policy that is heavy on conservation and fuel alternatives while allowing for some new oil drilling democrats see no need to make major concessions on energy policy with a party poised to lose seats in both chambers in just three months even if recess averse republicans continue to pound away on the issue

1713762 we love her and thats why we reached out to her and she happily agreed to participate
1713763 to be on the show and to hear other people its comforting to be around other people whove been through it
1713764 this is really the vibe of the show i hope she feels it we are all there for her now and know what shes going through were all thinking of her and praying for her
1713765 im in the midst of doing the script now and obviously because of her diagnosis that may change but im looking forward to talking to her about what she can do on the show
1713766 she found it early shes going to get through the treatment and shell be ok she needs to say i have an illness i have to treat it be good to my body and not overstress myself and then shell get well

1713778 hey i didnt do it out of choice did i damage the cooler and fan it happened and i dont know how
1713779 saddam hussein has destroyed a ramsar listed wetland penny wong and kevin rudd are about to join unique company
1713780 i get really annoyed at the rhetoric and the commentary going on about the cost of this and the cost of that what im thinking of is the other side of the coin or the other side of the equation that is the opportunities
1713781 weve got a lot of expertise in the country that we can sell and what id like this government to do is to develop our science and technology to then sell to other countries
1713782 i think as a nation we need to give the signal to our governments that its ok to dedicate a couple of billion dollars towards this because its going to benefit us for decades to come
1713783 and guess who has a lot of knowledge and intellectual capital to capitalise on this
1713784 australia we do we really are a clever country we punch way above our weight when it comes to scientific knowledge engineering knowledge engineering renewable energy resources and ideas and technology
1713785 we havent done that well in putting that technology into practice but we have it we have a lot of answers that we can provide dare i say sell to china and india and indonesia and malaysia and all those countries that are wanting to grow and expand and develop we can tell them how to do it perhaps more cleverly than we did it ourselves
1713786 when water is surrounding someone its really hard to measure whats going on
1713787 humans have to adapt our bodies to the swimming environment
1713788 the difference between normal people and olympians is that the olympians have made the adaptation to water really really really well
1713789 you knew it as soon as you saw the body at 11 he had everything he has now only smaller
1713790 if you dont count the five hours a day of torture i put him through
1713791 whatever i want to eat whenever i want it however much i want
1713792 youve got to understand how monotonous and boring our training is
1713793 michael knows its one of the things i absolutely hate most
1713794 when he first started doing it i went nuts and it wasted our time its just a way he has of asserting his independence from me a stupid way ive decided that for now im going to pick my battles and ignore it
1713795 i recently calculated how much michael is going to swim in beijing we dont know his final schedule yet but if its similar to athens the total time hell spend in the water preliminaries semifinals finals warm ups cool downs will be the equivalent of running eight or nine marathons over the course of the olympic games
1713796 we were just guessing high elbow position is better than low elbow position or pulling in the middle is better than pulling from the side now we can test any hypothesis
1713797 working on his technique with coach bowman for so many years
1713798 definitely helped phelps develop a very efficient way to generate his velocity curve on these graphs and years of high volume swimming really developed his aerobic conditioning but
1713799 im pretty sure we have many more michael phelpses in this country
1713800 there are plenty of methods we can use to evaluate a child
1713801 we can look at their biological parents and project their anthropometric parameters we can evaluate their aerobic ability by testing their maximum oxygen output or measuring their aortas we can test how fast they adapt to long term training its easy to evaluate but instead we rely on the athlete coming to us the way michael phelps came to bob bowman
1713802 im pretty sure his records will be broken in 5 to 10 years the swimmers who are going to do this are already in the system
1713803 there is no point at which athletes cant continue to improve you can always do higher intensity training or maybe higher volumes a swimmer can do more training on land or more strength training in water like swimming against resistances you can improve your technique you can improve your nutrition basically i dont see any limits in swim performance well never build the perfect swimmer the records will go up and up
1713804 do you reach a point where you cant go any faster probably but

1714093 the board has agreed in the settlement agreement that any meaningful transaction including the strategy in dealing with that transaction will be fully discussed with the entire board before any final decision is made
1714094 this approach exploits the complementarity of the two strategies as a flexible way to create nanopatterned functionalized surfaces
1714095 the supramolecular network whose dimensions can be controlled defines the lateral dimension of the pattern while the surface properties are tailored through the choice of the sam molecules
1714096 on the more speculative side the controlled positioning of molecular entities will also be required for assembling nanomachines molecular devices enabling transport and manipulation of molecules and nanosize objects on surfaces
1714097 we are just beginning to explore a very exciting new area
1714098 having demonstrated that we can combine sams and supramolecular networks we will now look at changes in the dimensions and geometry of the supramolecular networks where the aim is to have exact control over the arrangement of single molecules
1714099 dont you think its about time we have a that works for you

1714130 keep in mind that this miscanthus is completely unimproved so if we were to do the sorts of things that weve managed to do with corn where weve increased its yield threefold over the last 50 years then its not unreal to think that we could use even less than 10 percent of the available agricultural land
1714131 what weve found with miscanthus is that the amount of biomass generated each year would allow us to produce about 2 1 2 times the amount of ethanol we can produce per acre of corn
1714132 it wasnt that we didnt know how to grow switchgrass because the yields we obtained were actually equal to the best yields that had been obtained elsewhere with switchgrass
1714133 one reason why miscanthus yields more biomass than corn is that it produces green leaves about six weeks earlier in the growing season
1714134 one of the criticisms of using any biomass as a biofuel source is it has been claimed that plants are not very efficient about 0 1 percent efficiency of conversion of sunlight into biomass
1714135 what we show here is on average miscanthus is in fact about 1 percent efficient so about 1 percent of sunlight ends up as biomass
1714136 keep in mind that when we consider our energy use a few hours of solar energy falling on the earth are equal to all the energy that people use over a whole year so you dont really need that high an efficiency to be able to capture that in plant material and make use of it as a biofuel source
1714137 our highest productivity is actually occurring in the south on the poorest soils in the state
1714138 so that also shows us that this type of crop may be very good for marginal land or land that is not even being used for crop production
1714139 in the context of global change thats important because it means that by producing a biofuel on that land youre taking carbon out of the atmosphere and putting it into the soil
1714140 keep in mind that this miscanthus is completely unimproved so if we were to do the sorts of things that weve managed to do with corn where weve increased its yield threefold over the last 50 years then its not unreal to think that we could use even less than 10 percent of the available agricultural land

1714325 this working party is to be chaired by the current head of higher education waless own group and is likely to be made up in the main of the same establishment figures who have been doing everything possible to defend the vested interests of their own institutions and undermining any real progress towards setting up an independent welsh medium federal college this is why little progress has been made on theissue during the first year of the coalition government we must now step up a gear if the promise to set up the college is to be realised during the remaining life span of this government
1714326 our intention is to seize back the initiative from the establishment and to open up the debate and campaign to the people of wales as the establishment of such a college could benefit the whole country we shall therefore be turning our public meeting on the eisteddfod field in cardiff at 3pm wednesday aug 6th into an open working party to which everyone is invited to voice their views as to how the college should be set up eisteddfodwyr are also invited to post their ideas at the cymdeithas unit on the maes and all this evidence will be delivered to the minister so that she does not have to rely solely on the tired old establishment views
1714327 the decision by boris johnson to exclude labour from the london development agency board even though labour are the second largest group on the london assembly is a direct attack on the accountability and transparency of the lda

1714329 he reality of life under a tory mayor of london is beginning to emerge firstly he has issued budget guidance requiring an across the board reduction of 15 in city halls spending
1714330 the plans are backed by all the local councils and were being supported by ken livingstone and transport
1714331 the product of the countrys best minds in rice agriculture
1714332 providing input subsidies for hybrid rice is not a sustainable solution to achieve rice self sufficiency and address the rice crisis
1714333 merely perpetuate the misguided strategies that have turned the philippines into the worlds biggest rice importer
1714334 in nine 9 out of fourteen 14 regions it was gathered that failure to provide adequate technical assistance on hybrid farming techniques and to immediately attend to the problems of the farmers on the delay inadequate supply of hybrid seeds poor quality seeds high cost of fertilizer leaf disease and inadequate supply of bacteria leaf blight blb contributed to high production costs and lesser yields than expected dissipating the objectives of the gma hybrid rice program in this program unaccounted hybrid seeds worth p8 80 million and fertilizer coupons discounts denied by the farmers were noted in certain regions
1714335 will simply amount to subsidising big seed companies like sl agritech bayer and monsanto
1714336 the design of the fields interventions will actually make the rice program dependent on private companies with no accountability to the public
1714337 the private sector must play a greater role in the commercialisation of the technology while the government makes the policy environment conducive for the private sector to do its business
1714338 efforts at encouraging the participation of private seed companies should continue not only in hybrid rice seed production and marketing but also in r amp d activities for the development of new hybrids
1714339 bahrain needs food security particularly rice and the philippines needs investment and both parties are keen to see this deal happening
1714340 something that might give me a clue to where your sister may have gone
1714341 if one of them was a travel brochure from wherever it is that she went then yes
1714342 i said if one of them was a travel brochure
1714343 tiffany didnt throw out the milk so that proves she must have been kidnapped
1714344 or it could mean that she just didnt throw out the milk before she left its skim milk after all the stuff can barely be called milk in the first place so its not surprising that it lasts forever
1714345 perhaps it would be better if you just sat out here on the couch and let me do my job
1714346 i just met you a few hours ago im not about to let you go through my sisters personal things without my being there
1714347 ms cavanaugh you hired me to find your sister and i cant work with you hovering over my shoulder demanding to know what im doing every second if youve reconsidered hiring me just let me know and we can leave
1714348 i didnt think so now if you would be so kind as to go sit on the couch like i asked you to do
1714349 i thought you were going to wait in the living room
1714350 of course its personal its a diary which means that it could give us a clue where she might have gone
1714351 and i really doubt youll find an entry in there that says get kidnapped before lunch
1714352 im a professional and could care less about your sisters personal life except where it relates to her disappearance i need to read that diary so give it back
1714353 i told you that i dont want you reading my sisters diary
1714354 i just think its completely inappropriate for you to be reading her diary thats all
1714355 there could be something in there that might put us on your sisters trail
1714356 ill read through it and let you know if i find anything suspicious
1714357 im not going to sit here while you read that whole diary besides youd probably miss anything important anyway
1714358 now stop playing around and give it back to me
1714359 something someone obviously should have done a long time ago
1714360 the food situation is deteriorating and the number of children admitted in the special centres for malnutrition cases has doubled in the last three months

1714378 offensive coordinator norm chow demands we execute and practice at a fast tempo and demands perfection and that shows a lot neuheisel is a different type of coach hes personable hes definitely a players coach he jokes around with us but when its time to get serious he does
1714379 coach neuheisel is more adamant about us being aggressive in practice coach chow is more boisterous when it comes to us being perfect he wants perfection hes not really the rowdy guy but when he wants something done right he gets his point across
1714380 if josh is performing better than the strong side linebackers you can move bosworth back to strong side and keep josh on the weak side

1714383 i dont care about their ages as long as they can get the job done in college football there are some positions where you can get away with having a freshman in the lineup well look to see if they can handle it
1714384 im just learning learning learning until i cant learn anymore
1714385 to have a chance to play as a true freshman i couldnt ask for anything better i told coach walker if im not ready im not ready but if im ready i want to be on the field
1714386 wants to keep him at fs behind aaron ware for now ekbatani who played tackle in high school and for a year in junior college said he feels at home at right tackle although he admits to being rusty because he spent his first two years at ucla playing guard
1714387 i was a little nervous but once i got my first few carries i made some cuts and then i realized theres no pain no anything
1714388 ive never been on the field when hes been full speed

1714412 nachdem das oberste gericht der usa vor kurzem festgestellt hatte dass grundlegende rechtsstaatliche normen auch f r die gefangenen im us lager auf guantanamo zu gelten haben stellt sich die bush administration mit der neuen ank ndigung au erhalb des us rechts da sich die erkl rung nahtlos in den bisherigen umgang der regierung bush mit den guantanamo gefangenen einf gt ist die erkl rung nicht als bedauerliche ausnahme sondern als absichtsvolle politik zu werten die linke fordert die bundesregierung auf ihre engen verbindungen zu den usa zu nutzen um auf eine schnelle schlie ung des lagers hinzuwirken

1714431 but we need to move forward which is why we are pleased that the council has been able to secure funding for planning the next stages in attracting more investment more visitors and more jobs to guisborough
1714432 the new funding will be spent on what is known as a capacity project its really all about looking at how we can exploit the towns attractions as a tourist destination and identify ways in which we can attract other funding to enable the development of projects which can help bring in visitors for instance the plans for a mountain bike trailhead in guisborough forest
1714433 we need to have our basic strategy in place so we can work with our stakeholders like the guisborough market town partnership to make guisborough the vibrant and attractive town we all want to see

1714459 ill probably get detained by the police and then ejected out of the country but i believe its not anywhere near the risk or the fear that tibetans are living under the occupation of the chinese government
1714460 i am committed to giving the police the tools they need to get crime off our streets
1714461 i am pleased that my nominations for the new board have received support and i believe we now have an excellent team led by harvey mcgrath who has done a terrific job in a short time at the lda refocusing the agency on its priorities and restoring public confidence in its role his wealth of experience can be shared across the organisation and is exactly the right person to steer the lda on its new course giving value for money in its delivery of the skills jobs and regeneration that will keep london ahead of its competitors
1714462 todays commission decision is a decisive step towards meeting the european goal of reducing road accidents getting critical messages through quickly and accurately is a must for road safety
1714463 we should also keep in mind that with 24 of europeans driving time spent in traffic jams the costs caused by congestion could reach 80 billion by 2010 so clearly saving time through smart vehicles communications systems means saving money
1714464 towards an integrated national integrity framework consolidating the fight against corruption
1714465 we shall build on the integrity of the majority of our women and men of virtue to reinforce the bulwark against corruption and at the same time consolidate our strategies for combating corruption so that we can root out the wicked corrupt fraudsters who have no place in our society
1714466 the successful practice and implementation of a national integrity framework is predicated on strong leadership and the ability of leaders to set a vision based on the values of the society this government can create such a national integrity framework through laws systems and structures but ultimately there needs to be on the part of leadership a voluntary submission to a higher code of probity which goes beyond strictly legal prescriptions
1714467 the divide between rich and poor is rising at a troubling rate within sub regions of asia pacific leaving vast numbers of mothers and children at risk of increasing relative poverty and continued exclusion from quality primary health care services
1714468 unless discrimination against women and girls is addressed as part of overall strategies to improve child and maternal health high rates of maternal and child mortality will remain stubbornly entrenched
1714469 after much campaigning on the issue since the cases of iranian lgbt asylum seekers pegah emembakhsh and mehdi kazemi came to light we have got clearance from the web team on the prime ministers website for our petition
1714470 we now challenge the government to start treating lgbt asylum seekers with the fairness that they deserve these are people whove often fled persecution rape and torture who flee to our country and our response is to lock them up like criminals we say enough is enough of this inhumane policy we need to stick our necks out now and stand up for lgbt asylum seekers
1714471 the mayor has committed the gla group including the london development agency lda to work across a range of fronts to support londons social enterprises
1714472 the lsen will be a key route to reach social enterprises and ensure they are able to access londons wide range of business support services
1714473 social enterprise is a combination of conventional entrepreneurial drive with the culture of public service and in so doing represents the best of the public and private sectors
1714474 the lda is working closely with the key regional strategic networks in london social enterprise london the school for social entrepreneurs london voluntary service council and others to ensure that they are able to access the business link in london service as a major way in which we can encourage the growth and development of social enterprise in the capital
1714475 the uk has one of the best workplace safety records in the world with fatalities and injuries falling by more than 70 per cent over the last three decades but the public and business communitys perception of health and safety regulation is poor
1714476 introducing simple steps such as making information more easily available and getting better advice to firms that need it will help save time and money for uk business
1714477 inaccurate reports of the impact of health and safety on businesses and the public can be highly damaging putting the record straight on good common sense regulation that saves lives will help cut the unnecessary costs that exaggerated fears can cause
1714478 black and minority ethnic people should feel that their individual needs are being met rather than providers making assumptions about their cultural requirements

1714480 this funding will not only help the neediest people in haiti
1714481 it will also support the country in its efforts to achieve social and political stability
1714482 compared to a decade ago there are three million more people in work in britain and they all enjoy more employment rights than they would have in the past important minimum standards on wages paid leave maternity leave and conditions have been put in place
1714483 however as the forum found there are still dark corners of the labour market where rogue employers seek to mistreat their workers and more needs to be done to safeguard peoples rights
1714484 we want to prevent unscrupulous employers who undercut honest competition and prey on people who are fearful or so desperate to earn a living that they are open to exploitation
1714485 it is vital we boost awareness of employment rights and ensure those rights are properly enforced there should be no hiding place for employers who exploit vulnerable workers and who are not prepared to obey the law
1714486 this is in the interests of workers themselves and as was made clear by business representatives on the forum it is in the interests of the reputable businesses who treat their workers fairly and obey the law
1714487 our heartfelt sympathies go out to the families of the victims of these floods
1714488 civil protection is a european concern and i am happy to see that member states have expressed european solidarity by responding generously to the requests for assistance made through the monitoring and information centre any country member state or not is welcome to apply for assistance in times of need
1714489 almost all development creates some need for infrastructure and services so it is only right that development contributes a fair share alongside the billions of pounds of investment the government is putting in
1714490 cil will provide vital additional funding for the new infrastructure our communities need helping them to grow in a sustainable way
1714491 developers need as much certainty as possible given the current challenges they face from the international credit crunch which is why i have been working closely with the industry and local government to ensure that cil will deliver what is needed whilst giving more certainty and confidence compared to the current system
1714492 the secret of success is to know something nobody else knows
1714493 these figures show that northern republic of congo contains the mother lode of gorillas
1714494 it also shows that conservation in the republic of congo is working this discovery should be a rallying cry for the world that we can protect other vulnerable and endangered species whether they be gorillas in africa tigers in india or lemurs in madagascar
1714495 we knew from our own observations that there were a lot of gorillas out there but we had no idea there were so many
1714496 we hope that the results of this survey will allow us to work with the congolese government to establish and protect the new ntokou pikounda protected area
1714497 we hope that these results will speed up the classification of the ntokou pikounda zone into a protected area
1714498 i would like to offer my greetings to the peoples republic of china the organisers and the athletes participating in the forthcoming olympics games in beijing

1714500 this is a moment of great pride to the 1 3 billion chinese people these games should contribute to promoting the olympic spirit of friendship openness and peace i send my prayers and good wishes for the success of this event
1714501 the events of the last five weeks highlight the profound importance of dns to the proper functioning of the internet and the critical role nominum plays in protecting it
1714502 our customers around the world demonstrated an extraordinary commitment and ability to address this problem quickly and efficiently their confidence in nominum built on a long history of stable and predictable software releases allowed them to upgrade rapidly without disrupting their networks or operations
1714503 nominum has a strong track record of delivering software that works the first time
1714504 we were able to upgrade our servers and secure our high speed internet service in advance of the threat without any disruption to our customers
1714505 nominum has done its customers and the internet a great service by working so closely with me the carriers and the rest of the dns community on this common threat to the internet and nominum has delivered on the trust placed in it by its customers
1714506 to know that over a hundred and twenty million users are safe within such a short time after the vulnerability was discovered is excellent and nominums customers set a great example for others to follow
1714507 our hypothesis was that certain non toxic dietary agents that had the ability to promote reactive oxygen species ros would break down pancreatic cancer cell resistance to therapy following administration of mda 7 il 24 and be safe for human use

1714509 the last 10 to 15 years have seen particularly dangerous declines in rainfall in sensitive ecosystems in east africa such as somalia and eastern ethiopia
1714510 we wanted to know if the trend would continue or if it would start getting wetter
1714511 we can be quite certain that the decline in rainfall has been substantial and will continue to be
1714512 this 15 percent decrease every 20 25 years is likely to continue
1714513 a strong commitment to agricultural development by both african nations and the international community could lead fairly quickly to a more food secure africa
1714514 our oil dependence threatens our national security strains family budgets and contributes to global warming
1714515 advanced battery systems have enormous potential to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and federal leadership is needed if we are to make the transition to a more energy efficient future
1714516 currently 97 percent of our nations transportation sector is dependent on oil
1714517 we must begin the process of developing alternative sustainable ways to power the vehicles we drive and create the infrastructure to support these technologies if this funding decision is signed into law we will be doing just that
1714518 what people dont realize is these medications can pose a host of side effects including daytime drowsiness even bizarre behavior like sleep walking sleep eating and sleep driving there are alternative treatments such as sound machines that may be quite effective yet pose no risks at all

1714555 la verdad es que el discurso de la presidenta diciendo que volver a a impulsar la 125 no fue oportuno podr a haberlo obviado estamos preocupados si volver an a pensar algo parecido
1714556 invitamos al sector de cara al bicentenario faltaba el campo y las entidades plantearon que participar n es un paso muy importante

1714564 its hard to distinguish globular clusters from stars and galaxies using ground based telescopes
1714565 with hubble we were able to identify and study about 90 percent of the globular clusters in all our observed fields this was crucial for dwarf galaxies that have only a handful of star clusters
1714566 our study shows that the efficiency of star cluster formation depends on the environment
1714567 dwarf galaxies closest to virgos crowded centre contained more globular clusters than those farther away
1714568 we found few or no globular clusters in galaxies within 130 000 light years from messier 87 suggesting the giant galaxy stripped the smaller ones of their star clusters
1714569 these smaller galaxies are contributing to the buildup of messier 87
1714570 in messier 87 there are three times as many globulars deficient in heavy elements such as iron than globulars rich in those elements
1714571 this suggests that many of these metal poor star clusters may have been stolen from nearby dwarf galaxies which also contain globulars deficient in heavy elements
1714572 star formation near the core of virgo is very intense and occurs in a small volume over a short amount of time
1714573 it may be more rapid and more efficient than star formation in the outskirts the high star formation rate may be driven by the gravitational collapse of dark matter an invisible form of matter which is denser and collapses sooner near the clusters centre messier 87 sits at the centre of a large concentration of dark matter and all of these globulars near the centre probably formed early in the history of the virgo cluster
1714574 star formation farther away from the central region was not as robust which may have produced only less massive star clusters that dissipated over time
1714575 humans seem to be wired to look to faces to understand the persons intentions
1714576 people are always asking themselves does this person have good or bad intentions
1714577 if you can think of an emotion being communicated by the face as a kind of signal you can understand that we can amplify that signal into what was almost a caricature to see if we get the proper effect
1714578 foreigner became synonymous with enemy there was all this animosity directed towards any foreigner and at the same time there was an extraordinary outpouring of brotherly love within america we had this paradox that 9 11 led to intergroup harmony inside the united states while leading to intergroup conflict outside the united states
1714579 to the best of our knowledge this line of research is the first to document these relationships
1714580 our initial studies conducted during the week of the six month anniversary of 9 11 had americans read a u s senators policy on intergroup relations during this period of national challenge americans endorsed multiculturalism more as a domestic policy and assimilation more as a foreign policy
1714581 most recently we discovered that americans primed with 9 11 a foreign threat revealed higher levels of national identity than those primed with the columbine massacre a domestic threat
1714582 during a period of national challenge embracing ones national identity can be highly adaptive
1714583 the healing power of embracing ones national identity was obvious among the 78 percent of americans who indicated in 2002 that 9 11 and its aftermath has changed america for the better

1714596 whether it will do any immediate good or not is probably doubtful but i still have faith in the ultimate triumph of reason dealing with great problems of government
1714597 if indeed reason will triumph it will be because the reasons are good ones and because they are good ones judges in the future should be able to find them on their own they will not need any special guidance from the past that is from the dissenting judge years before

1714723 das 1000 km rennen lebt am 17 august auf dem n rburgring wieder auf ist das heimspiel auch f r audi etwas besonderes
1714724 selbstverst ndlich ist das 1000 km rennen auf dem n rburgring f r audi etwas besonderes im rahmen der lms ist es unser heimrennen wir haben die m glichkeit den deutschen fans unseren r10 tdi zu pr sentieren und ganz nah am geschehen zu sein der r10 startet erstmals in deutschland au erdem haben wir hier bereits 2004 mit dem r8 am ring gesiegt das m chten wir nat rlich gerne wiederholen und freuen uns auf ein spannendes rennen
1714725 wie hat sich das team in der zeit nach le mans auf dieses rennen vorbereitet
1714726 die wochen seit le mans haben wir genutzt um einige tests zu absolvieren aber auch die fahrzeuge bis ins letzte detail zu berpr fen und wieder f r das n chste rennen auf vordermann zu bringen au erdem gab es ein bisschen urlaubszeit und damit die m glichkeit ein wenig die batterien aufzuladen
1714727 in den bisherigen drei saisonrennen hat der gro e rivale peugeot gewonnen es wird also zeit f r einen audi sieg
1714728 bisher ist das so wir setzen alles daran dies zu ndern le mans hat gezeigt dass die konkurrenz weiterhin mit uns rechnen muss die mannschaft ist stark und nach dem erneuten erfolg beim schwersten rennen der welt hoch motiviert
1714729 auf jeden fall d rfen sich die fans freuen in einem langstreckenrennen wie wir es betreiben wird dem zuschauer sehr viel geboten vor allem viele fahrzeuge unterschiedlicher klassen und hersteller auf h chstem niveau und viele berholvorg nge es wird fast st ndig berholt und pausenlos action geboten durch die dauer des rennens von rund f nf stunden ist das motorsportereignis 1000 km rennen schon ein ganz spezielles
1714730 neben der american le mans serie und dem 24 stunden klassiker in le mans ist audi mit dem r10 tdi jetzt in der lms am start hat die europ ische le mans serie eine gro e zukunft
1714731 die akzeptanz der american le mans serie und der 24 stunden von le mans zeigt das interesse an diesem sport der faktor zeit spielt eine ganz andere rolle als bei einem sprintrennen speed und zuverl ssigkeit sind die h chsten gebote in einem so langen rennen wir wollen aktiv mitarbeiten und helfen dass diese serie den stellenwert und die akzeptanz bekommt die sie verdient hat
1714732 der reiz der le mans serie liegt nat rlich darin dass es eine europ ische serie ist aber auch die tatsache dass sie noch relativ in den kinderschuhen steckt sie hat unheimliches potenzial den langstreckensport auch in europa noch popul rer zu machen zudem ist es f r audi selbstverst ndlich eine sehr gute pr sentations plattform

1714802 nach pr fung der radio bremen unterlagen l sst sich keine zusammenarbeit mit dem institut g r p feststellen
1714803 selbst nach intensiver recherche kann ich jetzt nur feststellen uns ist von gesch ftskontakten mit der g r p weder in der vergangenheit noch gegenw rtig etwas bekannt

1714806 aus unseren gesch ftsunterlagen ergibt sich dass von uns in den zur ckliegenden jahren keinerlei auftr ge an dieses institut vergeben wurden der ndr wird nunmehr seinerseits kontakt zu dem institut aufnehmen und um eine erl uterung zu der frage bitten auf welcher basis unser haus in dessen referenzliste gef hrt wird
1714807 wir haben bei der berpr fung ihrer wohl oberfl chlichen arbeit die projekte die wir f r die sender gemacht haben ermittelt eine f lle von projekten die wir sofort gefunden haben es war ganz einfach es ist schon schlimm wenn man sich mit so viel unf higkeit herumschlagen muss
1714808 die referenzliste gab es in unseren g r p infobrosch ren seit ber 30 jahren und sie wurde bisher noch nie in frage gestellt
1714809 wegen der st ndigen von herrn paulus einem autor der zeit d red und wohl auch ihnen ausgel sten nachfragen und die dadurch zeitraubenden notwendigen recherchen bei uns im archiv die uns nur zus tzlich unn tige arbeit bereiten haben wir die seite nun einfach schon fr her geschlossen

1714814 headship in marriage does not mean that women submit to men it means one woman submits to one man her submission to her husband protects her from having to submit to other men prior to marriage her submission to her father protects her from having to submit to other men there is no overall biblical requirement that women be submissive to men in general the biblical pattern is that a wife should respond to the initiative and leadership of her husband and only to him she is prepared and trained for this in her submission to her father

1714817 this has a special place in my heart and i am gutted but my view is that the spirit of st felix will rise again literally from the ashes
1714818 july 21 but i started the post then i deleted everything on it and updated the real date i actually posted this is monday july 30
1714819 we have a very large site and like any organisation which has a large site we sometimes have issues with infestations
1714820 we do not have huge scale problems the vast majority of problems across the hospital have been with ants or flying ants there have also been instances with bees beetles and a cockroach was seen on one occasion
1714821 we have called in pest control so they could deal with these problems
1714822 on the one hand we should be grateful that they have noticed there is a problem and they are prepared to get in there and sort it out
1714823 there has been a building site there for some time which could have led to some unwanted creatures these visits from pest control show they are keeping on top of it
1714824 they have to make sure any food waste products are sealed up and kept away from vermin if anyone sees anything they should report it as soon as possible
1714825 the truth is that one of the fundamental problems of the nhs generally is housekeeping it is the first thing you have to get right
1714826 ipswich hospital has tried very hard recently to improve its record
1714827 i want to look very carefully as to what this means for ipswich hospital
1714828 es wundert mich nun doch etwas dass seit wochen in der ffentlichkeit weiter dar ber spekuliert wird
1714829 die stuttgarter wollten ihn partout nicht abgeben dabei sind 25 millionen euro plus x ja kein pappenstil
1714830 die zahlen zeigen dass wir in hinsicht abschreckung und pr vention auf dem richtigen weg sind

1714832 t he service will protect the identity of the claimant to the fullest extent permitted by law under some circumstances such as when the claimant is needed as a witness in a judicial proceeding it may not be possible to pursue the investigation or examination without revealing the claimants identity the service will make every effort to inform the claimant before proceeding in such a case
1714833 fraud is perhaps so pervasive and therefore costly to the government due to a lack of deterrence
1714834 coordinated effort of both the g overnment and the citizenry to decrease this wave of defrauding public funds
1714835 in the early years of the nation the qui tam mechanism served a need at a time when federal and state governments were fairly small and unable to devote significant resources to law enforcement
1714836 through haste carelessness or criminal collusion the state and federal officers accepted almost every offer and paid almost any price for the commodities regardless of character quality or quantity
1714837 the effect of the qui tam provisions is simply to hold out to a confederate a strong temptation to betray his co conspirator and bring him to justice the bill offers in short a reward to the informer who comes into court and betrays his co conspirator if he be such but it is not confined to that class in short sir i have based the qui tam provision upon the old fashioned idea of holding out a temptation and setting a rogue to catch a rogue which is the safest and most expeditious way i have ever discovered of bringing rogues to justice
1714838 supportive of improved integrity in military contracting the bill adds no new layers of bureaucracy new regulations or new federal police powers instead the bill takes the sensible approach of increasing penalties for wrongdoing and rewarding those private individuals who take significant personal risks to bring such wrongdoing to light
1714839 knowingly makes uses or causes to be made or used a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the government
1714840 conspires to defraud the government by getting a false or fraudulent claim allowed or paid

1714857 then i married a professional musician who guided me into the universe of classical music wich is too rich to name preferences then studying antropology i discovered ethnic music ritual and spiritual the world of the ancients the basic this was the beginning in understanding modern art consequently my music is a cultural fusion this definition may look too classy but the music is both intelligent and beautiful genuine and sophisticated like a rare and precious woman and just like a precious woman it requires all your attention and care

1714860 people said that if jews greeks africans slaves men and women the huge divides of that time period could come together successfully there must be something to this religion
1714861 these are your older brothers and sisters in the faith they are certainly my kinsmen according to the flesh though it must be easy for you to gloat over your new status as gods people dont do it these are the people through whom gods promises were fulfilled in jesus if you feel anything for their unbelief feel anguish as i do

1714864 presidential command power leadership and the making of foreign policy from richard nixon to george w bush
1714865 in addition to the obvious reference this race is meant to also commemorate our fellow brothers and sisters and their families who sacrifice much in pursuit of their chosen passion including those that have suffered the ultimate sacrifice
1714866 together we can make this truly the run to remember
1714867 there is so much inspiration for this run the kids from the hospital the memory of the many public servants who died on 911 and the kindness and caring americans showed in the days that followed
1714868 it will be a great event and i hope runners walkers kids families and all the people who care about our community will come together in support of kentucky childrens hospital
1714869 no one will ever forget the tragic events of september 11 2001
1714870 in fact when the topic is brought up it is often in the context of the horror and sorrow that will forever accompany that date in history however in the days and months that followed those events the united states fire service was the unsolicited recipient of an incredible and perhaps unprecedented wave of public support and good will
1714871 we are very proud to be able to do that
1714872 its difficult to praise rob without insinuating that there was something not great about his predecessor and ive got nothing but respect and love for jason newsted but rob hes been with us five years now and its completely effortless its never felt this complete
1714873 sometimes i look over at him and hes playing his bass onstage and it feels like hes always been there his chemistry his personality it just all fits in really really well hes a godsend
1714874 a lot of it did have to do with our fear of losing some kind of control no doubt about that but rob has slipped in somehow easier he has this respect about him we didnt have to haze the fan out of him or toughen him up somehow
1714875 sid had to take his cast off last night and im telling you i couldnt even look at his feet both his feet were black and blue and deep the bruises go like 2 inches in but hes up there every night no problem hes so out of his mind hes got a big bruise on his face because hes not used to slamming his head in a wheelchair so hes got a huge bruise on his face from smacking his head into his tables it never ends you think youre out of it and then youre back in on some other painful level sid was like i broke my feet but i cant miss a show so here i am in this wheelchair the good thing is he now knows hes not 25 anymore
1714876 all of these results will be compared to each other along with those of the mummy of king tutankhamun
1714877 we want to find out the truth and facts relevant to the history of these kings
1714878 it is doubtful that it could produce a scientific result to determine such important issues such as the linage of pharaohs
1714879 such announcements are good for publicity they sell well in the media
1714880 we promised to give long term support to areas badly affected by last summers unprecedented floods and carefully considered how each bid from these four areas fitted into their ongoing capital investment plans today i am delighted to announce additional funding for all of them
1714881 our priority last summer was to get funding to the frontline as soon as possible to reduce immediate direct pressures on local authorities revenue budgets staff parents and governors worked tirelessly last summer holidays to make sure that the vast majority of schools opened on time
1714882 i pay tribute to the professionalism of staff in the worst damaged schools who have faced very challenging circumstances over the last year todays funding should give those areas a big boost in addressing the long term rebuilding work and flood defence work
1714883 last years floods were the worst for a generation they affected 48 000 homes and more than 850 schools
1714884 but thanks to the extraordinary efforts of local authorities all children were able to return to classes if not their classrooms last september
1714885 this extra government money is very welcome support for councils who 12 months on continue to work hard to help their communities get back to normal
1714886 to stop and desist the perpetration of violence in any form
1714887 through his efforts we found out the truth about our country
1714888 he argued against the system and it cost him a lot it was my civic duty
1714889 he was a very brave and strong man who was able to represent in himself the best characteristics of our country when you come to such a man not just to honour him
1714890 you also receive something from being near such a figure
1714891 keep on doing what you have been doing keep the bandage dry and be more mobile over the next two weeks
1714892 a stark rural reality is starting to hit home now over five million households without gas are paying double what they were last year to heat their homes
1714893 this urban rural divide sadly also extends to two of the other essentials of life food and petrol or diesel
1714894 having to travel up to 20 miles to the nearest supermarket will typically add six pounds in fuel costs so villagers are increasingly relying on the corner store
1714895 of course these shops cant buy in bulk like the major supermarkets so they have to charge more and they cant offer the same range of foods either
1714896 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
1714897 brown bears usually dont attack people on the contrary theyll run away if they see one
1714898 he does not respect the bears habitat or worse tries to turn them into a tourist attraction
1714899 one day i got a call from a person who said theres a polar bear in my pantry
1714900 we have launched a relocation programme for binmen bears in distant regions where they will find sufficient food so that they will want to stay
1714901 but since they were binmen bears those countries said no
1714902 we are defending islam and its sanctity this is the country we were raised in why should we stand by while our men are defending the country
1714903 misusing the data to predict future performance could depress expectations of groups of pupils that have performed less well in previous years
1714904 it is no help to pupils from a particular ethnic group who have not performed well to know that other pupils from the same group nationally have not performed well the priority is to improve the performance of all individuals an if a particular group is underachieving to focus particular efforts on improving its performance
1714905 any data is fraught with difficulties cva is so much better than judging a school just on its raw results or only on its school inspection cva is the best measure we have of knowing how good a school is
1714906 data is only numbers on a page or a spreadsheet on a screen they only measure what has been tested and people only test what they can measure
1714907 he wasnt interested in sex until a cancerous tumour was removed from his bottom and he bit the tail off his female companion twice but since the operation his hormones have been raging
1714908 most hikers would succeed around microscopic items in case it were not troubled by having wonderful ambitions
1714909 it has proved successful in cutting traffic coming into london but on its own has not resolved the problem of congestion various works and schemes going on in the capital have also eroded its impact i am therefore introducing a more comprehensive approach to easing congestion in london
1714910 congestion would be a lot worse were it not for the charge
1714911 tfl needs to manage the roadworks better which is plainly possible traffic lights can also be rephased by giving less green time to pedestrians and more to traffic
1714912 without the congestion charge the traffic problems in london would be much worse however as a result of other interventions such as utility and construction works the reduction in road space has had a detrimental impact on congestion levels and is slowing traffic down
1714913 the third one would be facing your destiny if such a thing exists and making the ultimate decision
1714914 the problem is what del toros talked about to me is that hellboy iii would be the end of hellboy
1714915 and heres where we have the big conflict my version of hellboy in the comics is a finite story but its going to take me 15 years to get to the ending if he makes hellboy iii and its the death of hellboy im left doing the comic going but im not done yet
1714916 my hellboy is going to die but i want to be the one who does that and if del toro does my ending there wont be a lot of surprise when i get to the end of the comic
1714917 we havent spent a lot of time talking about what his version of the story would be
1714918 and i dont spend a lot of time thinking about that one
1714919 i cant help but think hes coming to the conclusion of the story
1714920 there are so many questions about how it might happen
1714921 and i hear ideas how it might be done but i have no idea how it would happen it would be nice to strike while the iron is hot but i dont know how that would be done
1714922 that will be between me del toro and my therapist
1714923 im still raising hellboy im not done with the character yet
1714924 i think it is destiny everything fell into place when we got together it felt like wed known each other for ever
1714925 its so strange how weve met again and fallen in love i cant imagine it happening to anyone else i feel so lucky ive found dale
1714926 hey is that a yak in your pants or are you just happy to see me
1714927 we believe the seabird deaths the scientists recorded might be just the tip of the iceberg
1714928 it suggests that around 18 000 seabirds may be killed annually in this fishery alone
1714929 most mortality relates to the dumping of fishing waste behind the boat this attracts seabirds which can either hit the warp lines or become entangled in the nets
1714930 the impact of this one local fishery has very widespread geographical repercussions
1714931 potential mortality at this scale for the albatrosses is unsustainable

1714941 as a part of the zvents network msn adds tremendous value to local advertisers trying to both broaden their reach and more precisely target customers with timely information across the web
1714942 it is very important to actividentity that jacques has elected to join us at this critical time of company growth and redirection
1714943 i personally embrace jacques as a partner and his expertise and background will be invaluable as we move forward with strategies and tactics that position the company for long term growth and improved shareholder value

1714970 if it is really going to make a difference and be done on a significant scale we will need greater flexibility to achieve that
1714971 we should probably not be doing this in the good times when the housing market is buoyant but in a downturn we are very aware of the local economy and are in a position to intervene if the right resources are in place
1714972 that is what local authorities will need to be asking government
1714973 we welcome that as an opportunity to promote sustainability and good mortgage packages that will suit people who are not able to get reasonable mortgage rates elsewhere
1714974 if we are really going to make a difference in a significant scale then we will need greater flexibility to achieve that
1714975 it is not just about paying your own mortgage but being able to manage the quality and standards of the property you are in
1714976 we have already started to do that and the proposals are perfectly reasonable

1714978 i think the bbfc do very good and important work but i was surprised having seen and enjoyed the dark knight that it was a 12a and not a 15
1714979 the film contains violent and disturbing scenes even though its a brilliant movie we should remember that bbfc classifications are only advisory and local authorities are ultimately responsible for classifications it would be interesting to see if any local authorities wish to use their powers for this and future films

1714988 the number of school leavers entering full time courses in computing has halved in recent years this is in contrast to research that suggests that 163 000 new employees will be needed in the it profession by 2016

1714992 then the seventh angel sounded and there were loud voices in heaven saying the kingdoms of this world have become the kingdoms of our lord and of his christ and he shall reign forever and ever and the 24 elders who sat befoe god on their thrones fell on their faces and worshipped god saying

1715001 for us choosing an enterprise search solution came down to two factors getting the quickest and most relevant search results not only does the google search appliance deliver fast and relevant results but our employees and agents dont need anything more technical than a few keywords to find what they need
1715002 and the new personalization biasing and alert features represent the type of user focused innovation that makes the google search appliance a good fit for our agents and for our organization

1715033 pushed to get legislation passed that would increase rewards for individuals who blew the whistle on tax cheats and created an office at the irs to coordinate whistleblower claims these improvements were based on my experience with the false claims act that rewards whistleblowers who help the government find fraud in government contracting this allows the irs to take better advantage of whistleblower information that is often detailed inside information this is information that the irs may not have otherwise received
1715034 pleased that many at the irs and treasury now recognize the benefits of rewarding tax whistleblowers it is vital that the irs take full advantage of those who are willing to blow the whistle on tax fraud

1715050 our current political economy does not sufficiently take account of time as an element in trade operations but as soon as the division of labour has once established itself in a community two principles at once begin to be important of which time is the very essence these are first that as goods are produced to be exchanged it is good that they should be exchanged as quickly as possible secondly that as every producer is mainly occupied in producing what others want and not what he wants himself it is desirable that he should always be able to find without effort without delay and without uncertainty others who want what he can produce
1715051 in our common speculations we do not enough remember that interest on money is a refined idea and not a universal one so far indeed is it from being universal that the majority of saving persons in most countries would reject it most savings in most countries are held in hoarded specie in asia in africa in south america largely even in europe they are thus held and it would frighten most of the owners to let them out of their keeping an englishman a modern englishman at least assumes as a first principle that he ought to be able to put his money into something safe that will yield 5 per cent but most saving persons in most countries are afraid to put their money into anything nothing is safe to their minds indeed in most countries owing to a bad government and a backward industry no investment or hardly any really is safe in most countries most men are content to forego interest but in more advanced countries at some times there are more savings seeking investment than there are known investments for at other times there is no such superabundance
1715052 lord macaulay has graphically described one of the periods of excess
1715053 for an undertaking which shall in due time be revealed
1715054 each subscriber was to pay down two gnineas and hereafter to receive a share of one hundred with a disclosure of the object and so tempting was the offer that 1 000 of these subscriptions were paid the same morning with which the projector went off in the afternoon
1715055 the fact is that the owners of savings not finding in adequate quantities their usual kind of investments rush into anything that promises speciously and when they find that these specious investments can be disposed of at a high profit they rush into them more and more the first taste is for high interest but that taste soon becomes secondary there is a second appetite for large gains to be made by selling the principal which is to yield the interest so long as such sales can be effected the mania continues when it ceases to be possible to effect them ruin begins
1715056 the rise of prices is quickest in an improving state of credit prices in general are mostly determined by wholesale transactions the retail dealer adds a percentage to the wholesale prices not of course always the same percentage but still mostly the same given the wholesale price of most articles you can commonly tell their retail price now wholesale transactions are commonly not cash transactions but bill transactions the duration of the bill varies with the custom of the trade it may be two three months or six weeks but there is always a bill times of credit mean times in which the bills of many people are taken readily times of bad credit times when the bills of much fewer people are taken and even of those suspiciously in times of good credit there are a great number of strong purchasers and in times of bad credit only a smaller number of weak ones and therefore years of improving credit if there be no disturbing cause are years of rising price and years of decaying credit years of falling price
1715057 the certain result is a bound of national prosperity the country leaps forward as if by magic but only part of that prosperity has a solid reason as far as prosperity is based on a greater quantity of production and that of the right articlesas far as it is based on the increased rapidity with which commodities of every kind reach those who want themits basis is good human industry is more efficient and therefore there is more to be divided among mankind but in so far as that prosperity is based on a general rise of prices it is only imaginary a general rise of prices is a rise only in name whatever anyone gains on the article which he has to sell he loses on the articles which he has to buy and so he is just where he was the only real effects of a general rise of prices are these first it straitens people of fixed incomes who suffer as purchasers but who have no gain to correspond and secondly it gives an extra profit to fixed capital created before the rise happened here the sellers gain but without any equivalent loss as buyers thirdly this gain on fixed capital is greatest in what may be called the industrial implements such as coal and iron these are wanted in all industries and in any general increase of prices they are sure to rise much more than other things everybody wants them the supply of them cannot be rapidly augmented and therefore their price rises very quickly but to the country as a whole the general rise of prices is no benefit at all it is simply a change of nomenclature for an identical relative value in the same commodities nevertheless most people are happier for it they think they are getting richer though they are not and as the rise does not happen on all articles at the same moment but is propagated gradually through society those to whom it first comes gain really and as at first every one believes that he will gain when his own article is rising a buoyant cheerfulness overflows the mercantile world
1715058 every great crisis reveals the excessive speculations of many houses which no one before suspected and which commonly indeed had not begun or had not carried very far those speculations till they were tempted by the daily rise of price and the surrounding fever
1715059 the good times too of high price almost always engender much fraud all people are most credulous when they are most happy and when much money has just been made when some people are really making it when most people think they are making it there is a happy opportunity for ingenious mendacity almost everything will be believed for a little while and long before discovery the worst and most adroit deceivers are geographically or legally beyond the reach of punishment but the harm they have done diffuses harm for it weakens credit still farther
1715060 the abstract thinking of the world is never to be expected from persons in high places the administration of first rate current transactions is a most engrossing business and those charged with them are usually but little inclined to think on points of theory even when such thinking most nearly concerns those transactions
1715061 the holders of this opinion in its most extreme form say that in a panic the bank of england can stay its hand at any time that though it has advanced much it may refuse to advance more that though the reserve may have been reduced by such advances it may refuse to lessen it still further that it can refuse to make any further discounts that the bills which it has discounted will become due that it can refill its reserve by the payment of those bills that it can sell stock or other securities and so replenish its reserve still further
1715062 the sale of stock too by the bank of england in the middle of a panic is impossible the bank at such a time is the only lender on stock and it is only by loans from a bank that large purchases at such a moment can be made unless the bank of england lend no stock will be bought
1715063 it may be said that the reserve in the banking department will not be enough for all such loans if that be so the banking department must fail but lending is nevertheless its best expedient this is the method of making its money go the farthest and of enabling it to get through the panic if anything will so enable it making no loans as we have seen will ruin it making large loans and stopping as we have also seen will ruin it the only safe plan for the bank is the brave plan to lend in a panic on every kind of current security or every sort on which money is ordinarily and usually lent this policy may not save the bank but if it do not nothing will save it
1715064 unfortunately the bank of england do not take this course the discount office is open for the discount of good bills and makes immense advances accordingly the bank also advances on consols and india securities though there was in the crisis of 1866 believed to be for a moment a hesitation in so doing but these are only a small part of the securities on which money in ordinary times can be readily obtained and by which its repayment is fully secured railway debenture stock is as good a security as a commercial bill and many people of whom i own i am one think it safer than india stock on the whole a great railway is we think less liable to unforeseen accidents than the strange empire of india but i doubt if the bank of england in a panic would advance on railway debenture stock at any rate no one has any authorised reason for saying that it would and there are many other such securities
1715065 an anonymous call about a 10 ounce weight loss by their then 3 week old daughter triggered a legal avalanche that buried arlington va residents nancy hey and christopher slitor their parental rights were terminated last year by arlington judge james almand even though hey and slitor had been exonerated of all neglect charges nine months earlier

1715074 it sounds like paris hilton supports john mccains all of the above approach to americas energy crisis including both alternatives and drilling in reality paris hilton may have a more substantive energy policy than barack obama
1715075 oh and remember when the big complaint was how the primaries just had to end because there was so little time to campaign against mccain
1715076 yet in this democratic year the subject that dominates chatter among pollsters is obamas stubbornly slim lead if there is a primary explanation as to why the race has remained close this summer it is that obama has failed to make gains overall with white voters who still cast about three in four ballots on election day
1715077 my my so it all comes down to women in the end
1715078 among women mccain closed 10 points on obama who still leads by a 43 38 margin

1715080 actually the dnc did not game the system people like harold ickes who as you know is a key party member and than whom no one is a smarter or tougher hillary supporter made the rules without any idea of what states might violate them or who that might advantage and then when fl and mi did violate them harold voted to take away 100 of their delegates again without knowing who that might or might not advantage just as it was a shame to have the war in iraq and all the other misery of the last 8 years because 97 488 fine bright principled people in florida voted for nader so it would be a shame to have 4 more years of bush and lose a womans right to choose and all the rest because of the way the chips fell in this admittedly remarkable but in no way rigged election hillary speaks on tuesday night of the convention i guess all i can do is ask you to listen to her thanks again for your passion for your country which i share ill be listening to hillary with you

1715100 the notion that there has been a steady increase in favour of women taking an equal role in the workplace and away from their traditional role in the home is clearly a myth
1715101 creationism is not for the re class because i believe that it can stand scientific scrutiny and that is a debate which i am quite happy to encourage and be part of the issue for the current education minister caitriona ruane is that she tells us shes all for equality surely if that is the case you cant have one set of interpretations being taught at the expense of others
1715102 the use of the word theory can mislead those not familiar with science
1715103 this is due to an increased disillusionment with current sinn fein strategy i no longer share the belief that this strategy will lead to irish unification it is not just solely about policing i am disillusioned with the current political strategy
1715104 i think this is half baked i dont think were ready for it i dont think the people want it

1715111 i think there is this idea that they can rely on us to ride to the rescue well they can t expect that when they haven t spoken to us on the issue for the last 16 months
1715112 we have been given the job to provide an effective opposition by the electorate and the fact is this is an incoherent and incompetent executive and my party will play no part in that
1715113 the reality is the executive in place has failed to tackle a range of problems from education to rural planning to the irish language and the proposed maze stadium
1715114 and the thought that they need us to take on a department they can t deal with on top of all the others they ve been unable to deal with properly is just bonkers

1715325 todays students use their computer as their notebook locker backpack and organiser they expect technology to provide solutions for their wants and needs students say they want more learning on the go options and mobile device services to align with their mobile lifestyle
1715326 technology should be used to enhance their learning and are clear that they will not engage with it if they feel it is not to their advantage
1715327 technology is an integral part of their lives and they feel particularly strong attachments to their personal gadgets such as internet enabled mobile phones mp3 players and laptops which they use to support their learning often experimenting with innovative usage
1715328 the boundary between using technology for learning and leisure is becoming increasingly blurred
1715329 as all digital immigrants learn like all immigrants some better than others to adapt to their environment they always retain to some degree their accent that is their foot in the past the digital immigrant accent can be seen in such things as turning to the internet for information second rather than first or in reading the manual for a program rather than assuming that the program itself will teach us to use it
1715330 to the degree that technology is flexible it will be bent to fit existing practice and that to the degree that it cannot be bent to fit existing practice it will not be used

1715384 this battle over obamas image as a black man is arguably the central front of the presidential campaign right now once sharp lines between the candidates on issues such as withdrawing u s troops from iraq or allowing new offshore oil drilling are becoming blurred the democratic partys structural advantages going into the election are formidable its hard to imagine how mccain could possibly win unless he generates doubt in voters minds about obama one way to do that would be to fabricate the impression that obama is demanding special treatment and privilege because he is black in other words turn a self made man into a stereotypical beneficiary of affirmative action

1715409 nobody has even approached farah to choreograph the song as yet neither srk nor priyan currently the only song farah is choreographing is karan johars dostana which was a long time commitment given to director tarun mansukhani
1715410 farah was approached but she excused herself citing her triplets as the reason but the real reason she refused is deepika padukone khan doesnt want to work with her farah gave the newcomer a big break with om shanti om but the actress hasnt kept in touch beyond a few smses farah doesnt like deepikas attitude and being a very straightforward person it would be difficult for her to work with her for 10 days and pretend all was well so farah passed up on the offer
1715411 i can never say no to shah rukh but the truth is that he hasnt asked me yet as for being upset with deepika i am too happy to be upset with anyone if srk asks me i will do it and just for him the heroine director or music directors dont matter i havent spoken to priyan since the release of viraasat though i appreciate what the film did for me jo jeeta wohi sikander was my first film and viraasat got me my first award right now i am only shooting for taruns song i want to spend as much time with my babies as possible

1715456 creationism is not for the re class because i believe that it can stand scientific scrutiny and that is a debate which i am quite happy to encourage and be part of the issue for the current education minister caitriona ruane is that she tells us shes all for equality surely if that is the case you cant have one set of interpretations being taught at the expense of others
1715457 the use of the word theory can mislead those not familiar with science
1715458 this is due to an increased disillusionment with current sinn fein strategy i no longer share the belief that this strategy will lead to irish unification it is not just solely about policing i am disillusioned with the current political strategy

1715467 we have been given the job to provide an effective opposition by the electorate and the fact is this is an incoherent and incompetent executive and my party will play no part in that

1715525 the latest example of mccain changing positions that had once put him at odds with conservative republicans including his new proposals to extend president bushs tax cuts and expand offshore oil drilling
1715526 changing ones mind is certainly the american way but changing positions to garner support from a particular population should be questioned even by those who oppose affirmative action
1715527 i have not seen the details of some of these proposals but ive always opposed quotas
1715528 once again i am compelled to dispel the myth that affirmative action requires quotas
1715529 goals may not be rigid and inflexible quotas which must be met nor are they to be considered as either a ceiling or a floor for the employment of particular groups quotas are expressly forbidden

1715540 bartletts mystery is gripping and keeps the reader involved however she excels at the relationship between jeff and richard two half brothers who didnt know each other well resent each other at times and sometimes even act childish in their sibling rivalry however richard cared enough to be there for jeff after his mugging offering him a place to live jeff resents richards wealth upbringing and gifts but he still worries and cares about his brother
1715541 the dissolution of syria and iraq into ethnically or religiously unique areas such as in lebanon is israels primary target on the eastern front iraq rich in oil on the one hand and internally torn on the other is guaranteed as a candidate for israels targets its dissolution is even more important for us than that of syria iraq is stronger than syria in the short run it is iraqi power which constitutes the greatest threat to israel
1715542 an iraqi iranian war will tear iraq apart and cause its downfall at home even before it is able to organize a struggle on a wide front against us every kind of inter arab confrontation will assist us in the short run and will shorten the way to the more important aim of breaking up iraq into denominations as in syria and lebanon
1715543 in iraq a division into provinces along ethnic religious lines as in syria during ottoman times is possible
1715544 a clean break a new strategy for securing the realm
1715545 work closely with turkey and jordan to contain destabilize and roll back some of its most dangerous threats
1715546 change the nature of its relations with the palestinians including upholding the right of hot pursuit for self defense into all palestinian areas
1715547 forge a new basis for relations with the united states stressing self reliance maturity strategic cooperation on areas of mutual concern and furthering values inherent to the west
1715548 the strategic initiative along its northern borders by engaging hizballah syria and iran as the principal agents of aggression in lebanon
1715549 israel can shape its strategic environment in cooperation with turkey and jordan by weakening containing and even rolling back syria
1715550 rebuilding americas defenses strategy forces and resources for a new century
1715551 over the long term iran may well prove as large a threat to us interests in the gulf as iraq has
1715552 the united states has for decades sought to play a more permanent role in gulf regional security
1715553 the need for a substantial american force presence in the gulf transcends the issue of the regime change of saddam hussein
1715554 may be to correct the historical defect and move in stages toward a three state solution kurds in the north sunnis in the center and shiites in the south
1715555 gave the bosnian muslims and croats the means to fight back and the serbs accepted separation
1715556 the first step would be to make the north and south into self governing regions with boundaries drawn as closely as possible along ethnic lines
1715557 at the same time draw down american troops in the sunni triangle and ask the united nations to oversee the transition to self government there
1715558 several islamic fundamentalist organisations including osama bin ladens al qaeda
1715559 mujahideen mercenaries from the middle east and central asia were recruited to fight in the ranks of the kosovo liberation army kla in 1998 99 largely supporting natos war effort
1715560 the u s state department listed the kla as a terrorist organization indicating that it was financing its operations with money from the international heroin trade and loans from islamic countries and individuals among them allegedly usama bin laden
1715561 the brother of a leader in an egyptian jihad organization and also a military commander of usama bin laden was leading an elite kla unit during the kosovo conflict
1715562 is an exact replica of an extreme right wing israeli plan to balkanize iraq an essential part of the balkanization of the whole middle east curiously henry kissinger was selling the same idea even before the 2003 invasion of iraq
1715563 this is classic divide and rule the objective is the perpetuation of arab disunity
1715564 independent commission set up by congress with the approval of president george w bush
1715565 has grown increasingly interested in the idea of splitting the shiite sunni and kurdish regions of iraq as the only alternative to what baker calls cutting and running or staying the course
1715566 iraqs federal future is already enshrined within its constitution allowing regions to form if not actually prescribing how this should happen
1715567 the iraqi parliament dominated by shia and kurds passed a bill earlier this month october 2006 allowing federal regions to form by majority vote in the provinces seeking merger
1715568 the law which unsurprisingly failed to win sunni support will be reviewed over the next 18 months in a bid to bring its opponents round
1715569 a system based upon five regions would seem to have more chance of succeeding
1715570 accepting that international statecraft has never developed effective tools short of war for readjusting faulty borders a mental effort to grasp the middle easts
1715571 iraq should have been divided into three smaller states immediately
1715572 saudi arabia would suffer as great a dismantling as pakistan
1715573 iran a state with madcap boundaries would lose a great deal of territory to unified azerbaijan free kurdistan the arab shia state and free baluchistan but would gain the provinces around herat in todays afghanistan
1715574 what afghanistan would lose to persia in the west it would gain in the east as pakistans northwest frontier tribes would be reunited with their afghan brethren
1715575 for now but given time and the inevitable attendant bloodshed new and natural borders will emerge babylon has fallen more than once
1715576 oh and one other dirty little secret from 5 000 years of history ethnic cleansing works
1715577 has been used in a training program at natos defense college for senior military officers
1715578 the sweeping reconfiguration of borders he proposes would necessarily involve massive ethnic cleansing and accompanying bloodshed on perhaps a genocidal scale
1715579 the idea as in bosnia is to maintain a united iraq by decentralizing it giving each ethno religious group kurd sunni arab and shiite arab room to run its own affairs while leaving the central government in charge of common interests
1715580 the first is to establish three largely autonomous regions with a viable central government in baghdad the kurdish sunni and shiite regions would each be responsible for their own domestic laws administration and internal security the central government would control border defense foreign affairs and oil revenues
1715581 the second element would be to entice the sunnis into joining the federal system with an offer they couldnt refuse
1715582 would look like this the central government would be based on the areas where there are genuine common interests among the different iraqi parties that is foreign affairs border defense currency and above all oil and gas production and revenues
1715583 as for the regions whether they be three or four or five whatever it may be its up to all this is up to the iraqis to decide would be responsible for legislation administration and internal security
1715584 something that the united states was going to force down their throats
1715585 when ambassador ryan crocker appeared before the senate foreign relations committee he testified in favor of federalism in his private conversations with senators he also supported the idea
1715586 break up of iraq into three separate states with their own governments and representatives to the united nations but continued economic cooperation in a larger entity modeled on the european union
1715587 that the united states shouldnt necessarily keep iraq from splitting up
1715588 perhaps the reality is that paris has a more substantive energy plan than barack obama
1715589 i know daniel ive always known i love you too
1715590 because you fucking text messaged me like six times yesterday i was busy
1715591 if someone blind folded me and put me in your car i would recognize it by the smell

1715594 you know i did last year in the computer room while i had my leg wrapped around yours and i was kissing your little ear
1715595 hamdans trial violated two of the most fundamental criminal justice principles accepted by all developed nations the prohibition on the use of coerced evidence and the prohibition on retroactive criminal laws the trial will not create finality the decision to keep these cases out of the ordinary criminal courts will produce years of appeals over novel legal issues raised by the untested military commissions system even after those appeals are finished the process will never be seen as legitimate by the world this case was the first trial run of the commissions system and the decision proves nothing except that the system itself should be scrapped terrorism related crimes should be tried in the time tested domestic criminal justice system a system whose rules have been designed over the centuries with one goal to seek out the truth
1715596 an amazing movie i just watched with my daughter who is now a mother also is such a delight just like the painting thanks magy

1715605 could they be hymns frogs chanting in the temple well
1715606 mosquito larvae dancing a buddhist chant in the water by the grave
1715607 by the power of complete non attachment the frog floats
1715608 if your actions inspire others to dream more learn more do more and become more you are a leader
1715609 if you say it 100 times it becomes a fact
1715610 a lot of tension in leadership situations comes because we have a fixed idea of what should happen regardless of peoples abilities to carry that thing out
1715611 i have no mind all i have is the heart
1715612 he knew that ridicule was the next step in obamas playbook so he went there first so that even if it is clumsy it makes obama look like a copycat if he starts
1715613 it would be more quiet and i would love chicago but that wont happen so i hate it
1715614 our next album death magnetic comes out in september and the day it comes out it will be available in the guitar hero 3 format which were obviously super psyched about

1715625 auyuittuq means land that never melts but of course now its melting
1715626 at the time that it flooded in pang there was also rain on snow in auyuittuq national park and that actually started to set the stage for what followed
1715627 i think some of them were obviously a little upset because they were going to do the overlord to pang trip but i think theyre still going to have a great time
1715628 crater lake looks like its stabilized but before we lift the closure we want to make sure staff go on foot through the park on the east side right from overlord to windy lake to make sure that things are all right
1715629 this suggests that service centres across the industry are listening to their customers and putting more focus on improving the overall service experience
1715630 he was frustrated that the house always looks like a tornado hit it whenever hes been away so he created a chore list and posts it on the refrigerator every day

1715635 she said its too dangerous its too dangerous and i sensed she was very afraid of water also the way of swimming in china its not the way we swim in belgium its more like how dogs swim its like trying not to drown
1715636 i think most important is make kids not afraid of water and also try to be brave
1715637 when more kids know how to go sailing at least a few of them can be good sailors in the future probably they will be the gold medal in the olympics some years later in the meanwhile at least a few of them will see this will be a hobby in their life they will buy the boats
1715638 the combined effects of these shocks raised uncertainty increased inflation risks and compounded the ongoing correction in the domestic housing market
1715639 a run on northern rock a medium sized mortgage lender raised the spectre of financial stability weakness feeding through to the real sector
1715640 so far in 2008 evidence points to a sharp slowing in activity alongside high inflation
1715641 second quarter growth was weak forward looking indicators are gloomy sterling money market spreads remain elevated unemployment has edged up and house prices are falling rapidly
1715642 given the outlook for inflation and the stance of fiscal policy imf directors saw little scope for monetary easing at present
1715643 underpinned this remarkable performance will be tested by lower growth higher inflation from food and fuel price increases ongoing strains in financial markets rapid house price reversals and medium term external imbalances the financial sector strains have also triggered a broad based effort to reform the financial stability framework
1715644 countrywide conned customers into loans that were clearly unaffordable and unsustainable turning the american dream of homeownership into a nightmare
1715645 when consumers defaulted the company bullied them into workouts doomed to fail countrywide crammed unconscionable legal fees into renegotiated loans digging consumers deeper into debt the company broke promises that homeowners could refinance condemning them to hopelessly unaffordable loans
1715646 we will release rafinha to play at the olympic games if the brazilian football association quickly create the conditions for his involvement

1715656 or if were all just floatin around accidental like on a breeze
1715657 she did endorse obama so clinton is not officially in the race anymore but she didnt release her delegates
1715658 we want to make it very clear that we want hillary at the top of the ballot
1715659 barack obama is the democratic nominee not hillary clinton i dont have any other comment other than that
1715660 no matter who the vice presidential nominee is i just cant vote for obama
1715661 i just dont think he has the experience or the contacts to do what this country needs right now
1715662 ive seen the sites for these groups and they sound bitter and really kind of insane
1715663 theyre not helping anything and it wont work get over it you know i did
1715664 i feel stuck because i cant stand mccain and obama just hasnt won my trust just yet
1715665 i was so angry when hillary endorsed him because i didnt think it was over yet id like to think its not so these grassroots people appeal to me but i dont know how realistic it is to believe in them
1715666 i dont think ill head to the convention but for those people that do i wish them all the luck in the world
1715667 cut off from an area of their city without any due process
1715668 if im gonna work in kitchens i might as well design them
1715669 leading clubs at home and on the continent as well as the united states and asia
1715670 i gave my all at west ham and enjoyed my time there but the decision is the best for the both of us now i will take my time to consider my football future
1715671 i dont see it that way even if it appears so
1715672 he had asked me about a paternity test and thats why i wanted to pass along the address
1715673 you cant take what ive said in certain interrogations 100 percent seriously
1715674 so what you said during police questioning could have been lies
1715675 yes for example the colour of my bicycle pump at the time i answered that i didnt know except that i did know exactly or why i was at stockholm south general hospital
1715676 when you were asked about private matters such as your pregnancy earlier you said you wouldnt answer why not simply do that in this case
1715677 everyone has an opinion about this that the money was misspent
1715678 ingen kan nu g ra anspr k p att vara den ryska nationens samvete
1715679 das mittlere alter wurde von sinnleffers nicht den anspr chen entsprechend bedient

1715682 we reacted to the fact that he took out money in nyk ping the same day he was planning to leave the next day he rented a car and registered at a hotel in spain then today he paid for a taxi ride again back home in sweden
1715683 so nice of you not to run me over major polluter
1715684 watching the sub pop flag fly from the roof of the space needle i felt that civic pride swell in my chest so quickly that my eyes started watering
1715685 wed always just hang out watch movies and smoke cigarettes
1715686 my girlfriend was really square and really hot and her boyfriend was really square and really hot so there was them and then us two total scumbags
1715687 it said south king county surf band needs rhythm guitar player call jesse and i thought you know the only guy with enough balls in south king county to have a surf band would be jesse
1715688 i just met jesse and said hey you guys are great i just bought your record
1715689 and he just shook his head like he totally disapproved which i took as a bad sign i went home and listened to it and immediately agreed
1715690 jesse told me that we were supposed to go meet with this label and im like really
1715691 i rock up to training and folkesy steve folkes someone that to be honest has never paid any interest in my personal life he comes up to me and starts saying youre not turning muslim are you
1715692 i start to think who is he to question my friends
1715693 if you asked hazem el masri about how i perceive muslims youll find ive often asked him questions about the religion because i dont fully understand it
1715694 if something comes up that i heard i ask him
1715695 its certainly not right of him to say that we took no interest in his home life or personal life
1715696 i supported him through the clovelly hotel thing when he was caught allegedly having sex in the toilets with ironwoman candice falzon his drink driving thing through his urinating in public thing
1715697 we stood up for him and did our best to try and get him through that so i think it is a pretty naive statement to make
1715698 in light of what has happened my advice about him not putting too much credence into what anthony mundine says was probably good advice
1715699 who is he to come and question my friends and their values and their religion
1715700 who does he think he is does he think he is god is he god or something
1715701 yeah whatever comes out of his mouth is that right
1715702 when i did join up with khoder and asked khoder to manage me
1715703 obviously to do something like that leave i wasnt happy
1715704 i havent been happy at the dogs for a while
1715705 nothing to do with the players i love my close mates but a whole range of things
1715706 it wasnt that long ago that he signed a five year deal so i assumed to commit to somewhere for five years he was happy to commit to that
1715707 i know sonny has been going around crying poormouth about only earning 500 000 a year cant survive on that
1715708 i dont know if it is just this generation whether it is young footballers or generation y in general but they expect everything and dont want to cough up for it
1715709 they expect that everything is going to be given to them on a platter and the fact he cant survive on 500 000 a year is a bit sad really
1715710 he will do anything now to try and justify this decision regardless
1715711 i was in the room last year when he agreed shook hands and signed a deal to stay with us five years
1715712 so regardless of what he says now its all p in the wind really
1715713 one of the finest united states senators that we have
1715714 what he stands for who he is and the desperate need for change and a better direction in washington
1715715 few writers have made such a splash with their first appearance in analog and even fewer have so successfully sustained their initial popularity for good reason as youll see in these stories
1715716 michael a burstein is an isaac asimov for the new millennium fiercely intelligent and wonderfully good hearted with a clear accessible writing style his stories are by turns clever moving and witty few writers have such an impressive list of award nominations and this most welcome collection proves that the science fiction short story is alive and well bravo
1715717 i still remember the thrill i got when i read my first short story written by one of the great masters of the form phillip k dick harlan ellison ray bradbury robert silverberg phillip jos farmer isaac asimov the first time i read michael a burstein i knew another great master of the form had been added to that prestigious list michaels stories are quite wonderful consistently perfect examples of the art he sets up his own precise and scientifically accurate worlds and populates them with thoroughly believable and interesting characters his stories are so good they change the way you view reality if youve read him you know what im talking about if you havent what are you waiting for buy this book and get started today youre in for a real treat its like discovering a bright new star
1715718 when you read all these final ballot stories youll know why michael a burstein has a legion of enthusiastic fans i remember the future is a remarkable collection displaying all of his many strengths
1715719 michael burstein writes securely and powerfully within the great tradition of modern campbellian science fiction in fact no one of his generation may do so with his force and fire he has immersed himself whin our central literature carried it forward in love honor and signal accomplishment these stories are intrinsic and they will live burstein is paying forward and he is paying back his work assures me that through it our own will last therefore this collection gives me hope it is the first book of a career which will carry all of us across the river
1715720 what do i do in the morning when i dont want to get up and everything sucks
1715721 we had to cut him off on a couple of occasions
1715722 vince neil had taped pictures from porno magazines all over the wall and girls were streaming in and out of the studio getting fucked with microphones in the control room bottles in the kitchen and broom handles in the closet because we were running out of ideas of what to do with them
1715723 were aware of what people feel is successful and what people feel has not been as successful
1715724 i mean were aware were smart we read you know the internet
1715725 the one certainty about this case is that the millers were really faithful
1715726 their marriage and their baby were their life they were attractive and had friends and fun the night they were killed they had been together at a gay nightclub but cheat on each other no absolutely
1715727 some strange things have been happening lately randi and i dont know what you two are trying to tell me but i have been seeing you guys everywhere
1715728 i hope you saw miss kassidy trying to walk last evening she is going to be running by friday if she has her way
1715729 im a soldier im always listening to music i like ballet i like any type of fruit juice i like fishing i like to run i have a punk fucked up emo chola wardrobe i like earth dirt i enjoy planting gardens i like gorgeous snakes
1715730 how was your leave did sic anyone break into your house
1715731 we have eight people out right now and were all in one van with no trailer
1715732 its like the ringling brothers clown car russian nesting dolls and tetris
1715733 last year we played the montreal jazz festival in front of 5 000 people and then we did our own show and less than 50 people showed up
1715734 its an instrument you find in various forms all over africa
1715735 its hard to read reviews where it just sounds like the writers are trying to out obscure each other
1715736 we played a workshop for seventh and eighth graders in colorado and it turned into a freaky dance party were not that cerebral
1715737 i was definitely the beneficiary of having a public school music program
1715738 id sit on the stoop until the bouncers felt bad enough to let a 14 year old in
1715739 we played in chapel hill and afterward this guy came up and was like i know this is over the top but your band changed my life hed heard us on college radio and that inspired him to start djing at the station and then he moved on to an even bigger station and now hes doing it almost full time
1715740 sometimes all you can really ask is that people just pay attention i dont know if well ever reach that buzz band level but having a relationship with the audience makes it bearable i dont not being too funny maybe you should talk to our baritone sax player hes really funny
1715741 modern mix of in search of truth and recreation day
1715742 they have exactly the sound that our fans expect from us
1715743 two years ago we needed an album with a slightly different approach and an expensive producer just to find out how that sort of thing works
1715744 it was the right album at the time but now we have returned to our typical trademarks
1715745 there is so much additional material for each album that we could theoretically re release it on an extra dvd whatever we manage to do premium reissues are certainly a possibility

1716051 how can we move from finding the shortest path to finding the best path what does best mean for a dog for a soldier
1716052 much too much effort is spent in games in finding the shortest paths there is a near obsession with admissible heuristics which is completely misguided who the heck cares about the shortest path in our everyday lives we rarely if ever take a shortest path instead we often optimize for search effort taking a path were familiar with which weve chunked or otherwise memorized so as to require no search well the same applies to games and the a algorithm

1716088 if terrorism is afflicting this region it is better to join forces to root this menace out so that development can take place
1716089 afghanistan is emerging as key on war on terror taliban would not be force to reckon with unless supported by outside forces financially and militarily the blasts at indian embassy in kabul shows unless and until support to taliban stops from outside the us led coalition forces are going to stay there for longer period

1716094 creating a quilt is not only fun and relaxing its a personal and unique way to connect with others some of my best memories are times i spent quilting with my mom my children and my friends or making a quilt as a gift
1716095 it used to be that women would gather together around a quilt to not only help each other create a handmade work of art but it was also a social event i mean who needs a therapists couch when youve got a quilters chair today while there are certainly still those quilters who hand stitch their quilts we now have high tech quilting machines that make light and expedited work of finishing a quilt if only those machines had a shoulder to cry on
1716096 quilting is still a creative outlet for me and it helps to reduce stress there is nothing like the feeling of joy and the sense of accomplishment that comes from creating a keepsake with my own two hands that i can give to someone i love that is a benefit that never changes
1716097 my pashmina shawl was designed with a brown and white flower trellis design on a muted teal background but the project is designed so that any variation on those colors can be used
1716098 just like this project a shawl is meant to be versatile my favorite way to wear a shawl is as the focal point of an outfit the embroidery on the pashmina shawl is designed to be the showstopper so the rest of the outfit exists to showcase it and as for the in flight brilliant you can bet that ill be trying that
1716099 the mc11000 complements my crafting by giving me more time to do the work i love the machine contains so many amazing features and time saving conveniences that i can do more in less time
1716100 my favorite features are the touch screen and built in edit functions because they are so intuitive to work with i was able to sew and embroider right out of the box im not one to fuss with stacks of manuals and hours of tutorials i just want to turn it on and go janome is famous for making things easy and that certainly comes through with this mc11000
1716101 life is full of things that inspire us we just have to remember to look i like to watch whats happening in fashion and home d cor for color trends ill see the shape of an object or in a work of art and ill translate that into a pattern design ill see the fresh vibrant color of a juice bottle on the shelf at the grocery store or a new make up color or the line of a handbag and ill get excited i know im nuts but i really am inspired by so many of the little things in life

1716116 people who are planning to vote obama because they dont want more of george bush and they perceive john mccain to be more of bush and therefore are in effect voting for change
1716117 weve been growing like wildfire and suddenly weve hit a brick wall in the last year
1716118 we used to have debates in the city about how we were going to spend all our money not anymore now people are thinking about what we can afford
1716119 there is a general disdain for the way the republicans have handled the economy
1716120 i dont think people think there is a chance of us winning the war
1716121 its a civil war over there and people want to see their boys come home
1716122 it used to be that democrats and republicans were black and white on a lot of issues but its a lot more mixed now theres more crossover

1716133 there were alternative olympics set up in barcelona and they had gotten as far as printing the programs but then the spanish civil war broke out
1716134 the nazis they used those games in order to prove to their own people their international legitimacy
1716135 you may be seeing some parallels with the current games
1716136 there was a nonviolent protest and the government opened fire and killed about 250 people and the international olympic committee said this was a domestic issue and should not be addressed by the olympic movement
1716137 you can shoot down 250 people on the street but dont ruin our medal ceremony
1716138 people are completely oblivious to the fact that people were massacred in the streets of mexico city it shows how images and media can create our perception of a historical event
1716139 however that was an event that created its own history
1716140 if that hadnt happened you wouldnt associate the 1972 games with terrorism
1716141 the beijing olympics mark the moment in human history when china which is farthest from the political centers of the west both culturally and geographically is incorporated into the world system to a degree never seen before
1716142 because of the intense interaction and high level of collaboration with the outside world required to organize the olympic games many chinese people are just now realizing that their old way of doing things did not reach international standards and that they did not understand the west as well as they thought they did
1716143 the impression they make on the rest of the world is secondary
1716144 whats important is to show their own people the 95 percent who arent communists that the rest of the world acknowledges the communist party as the legitimate leader of china
1716145 if the u s president will stand next to their leader thats fine

1716149 if we think about the wal mart model it is incredibly fuel intensive at every stage and at every one of those stages we are now seeing an inflation of the costs for boats trucks cars
1716150 that is necessarily leading to a rethinking of this emissions intensive model whether the increased interest in growing foods locally producing locally or shopping locally and i think thats great
1716151 its primary purpose is to inform discussions and debates because frankly there has been a lot of rubbish about who can claim sovereignty over what
1716152 to be honest most of the other maps that i have seen in the media have been very simple
1716153 we have attempted to show all known claims agreed boundaries and one thing that has not appeared on any other maps which is the number of areas that could be claimed by canada denmark and the us

1716161 but midway through the year were already at 1 4 million so were going to be raising our projections

1716179 companies that rely on credit are now delaying and canceling expansion plans as they struggle to secure finance

1716181 but when mr greenblatt called the local branch of wachovia the same bank that had been aggressively marketing loans to him for years he was distressed by the response
1716182 the exact words were were saying no to almost everybody
1716183 this is why god made banks for this kind of transaction this is going to slow down the american economy
1716184 banks struggling to recover from multibillion dollar losses on real estate are curtailing loans to american businesses depriving even healthy companies of money for expansion and hiring
1716185 access to capital and credit is essential to growth if that access is restrained or blocked the economic system takes a hit

1716188 before they wouldnt verify income and they were loose on the valuations of collateral
1716189 now theyre tightening down on the ability to repay they go off the reservation and now they come back to basics its preservation for many of them at this point its survival
1716190 theres been a lot of disruption in the credit market and a lot of traditional lenders have really tightened up
1716191 before some of the standards they lent on were weak but we think they have overshot and gone too far on the other end
1716192 god is smiling on this factory were at such an exciting inflection point and this is what a bank is supposed to do theres sand in the gears
1716193 weve got industries that we consider to be stressed industries and were looking at those a lot harder
1716194 our loan growth slowing is more indicative of the economy than anything else
1716195 banks will be much more cautious and keep raising the bar and that will lead to an outright decline in total commercial and industrial loans
1716196 banks clearly have to rebuild their capital base theyre going to look a bit more nervously before they make those loans
1716197 its the small business guy who creates most of the jobs
1716198 if they cant borrow to employ people then weve got a mess on our hands
1716199 they keep saying the way the times are we need a longer track record

1716217 if weve had a rise around indebtedness if weve had a rise in hikers and swimmers with difficulty servicing that debt so perchance a banks come lending when well much money or even possibly itre non being as careful as they wore to be within scrutinising the applications whenever theyd non lent it a money in the first place then they wouldnt be in the difficulty of trying to feel better it

1716220 if verified the discovery of these new populations of gorilla are hugely significant for our work as conservationists but we must not be distracted from the very real and present danger these gorillas are in from man and ebola
1716221 there is a danger that we concentrate on the more famous species
1716222 what about the other species that weve identified as in danger there are so many that are on the brink of extinction
1716223 in malaysia sumatra and borneo the big problem is destruction of forests to make way for palm oil and biofuels ironically with biofuels something that is nominally associated with helping the environment can have harmful unintentional consequences
1716224 in 1980 the population density of macaques was as much as 300 individuals per square kilometer in 10 years this had decreased to between 60 to 20 individuals per square kilometer
1716225 imagine the human population of the world reduced to that of one small town thats what we are talking about here
1716226 the habitats in which they live are largely impenetrable and we constantly find new species
1716227 having said that this the western lowland gorillas remains a unique find i dont know if well ever find something on this scale again
1716228 i think the lesson for conservationists today is that yes the world is full of surprises theres a lot of uncharted territory there in central africa there may be other populations
1716229 the p5 1 major powers are discussing next steps in the u n security council and beginning to consider possible outlines of another sanctions resolution
1716230 we are very disappointed that iran has failed yet again to give a clear answer to the p5 1 generous incentives package the letter we received yesterday appears to be a stalling tactic
1716231 we want to see prosperity and freedom restored to burma
1716232 the united states believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings

1716241 there is no public transport the mining industry is closing down
1716242 i do support the message not the strike they shouldnt have stopped the transport
1716243 the issues they raised are not populist they are realistic and they are surmountable
1716244 on the other hand if we ignore the plight of the poor people were going to do it at our peril because this is a cry from the working and poor classes to do something dramatic
1716245 it may not mean anything other than shes getting good legal advice
1716246 you dont know what the dea may suspect in this case and i think its a cautious way to proceed i think it would be wrong to assume shes done something criminal simply because shes invoking her fifth amendment against self incrimination
1716247 were prepared for the onslaught that will come from the democrats
1716248 i dont think theres a state in america that either party should take for granted
1716249 this will be an election year like none other the united states has seen
1716250 we have invested a tremendous amount of time and energy in making our in game platform solid for our users
1716251 changes include new features and widgets enhanced usability a new product skin and performance enhancements across the overall system
1716252 mi cocina se basa en respetar los productos los sabores que cuando vengas a comer comas rico y sabroso y al otro d a te acuerdes de lo que comiste como algo nico lo bueno de la comida es que te permite recordar momentos y sensaciones qui n no se acuerda de los platos de las abuelas o las pastas de los domingos eso es lo que busco

1716254 in the long term the media and advertising outlook for asia is tremendous as wealth is created and people get educated and you see the emergence of a wealthy middle class
1716255 we dont see ourselves taking a stake in print because they are not available and because we wont want to take just a 26 stake
1716256 the generally accepted theory is that financial markets tend toward equilibrium and on the whole discount the future correctly i operate using a different theory according to which financial markets cannot possibly discount the future correctly because they do not merely discount the future they help to shape it

1716258 if 40 billion cannot bring about even a minor rally just how weak and despised is the once almighty dollar
1716259 were like the untrustworthy brother in law who keeps borrowing money promising to pay it back but can never seem to get out of debt
1716260 give the majority of investors the illusion of wealth as asset markets appreciate
1716261 while the loss of the currencys purchasing power is hardly noticed this is particularly true of a society that has a very large domestic market where 90 percent of the people dont have a passport and therefore know little about what is going on outside their own continent and where the import prices of manufactured goods are in continuous decline because of the entry of china as a huge new supplier of products with an extremely low cost structure into the global market economy
1716262 if ever there was a crisis that could shake the global economy this is it
1716263 kia has an intention to double or triple its investment in the japanese market
1716264 we are focusing on prime cities in india china singapore korea vietnam and malaysia cities around the world where there is strong gross domestic product growth and fundamental unmet demand for high quality real estate
1716265 about 40 of our real estate investments will be in asia
1716266 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the committee
1716267 my view is that the fed is on hold at least through the fall and likely
1716268 the worries about inflation notwithstanding the fomc still started with a discussion of the economy the comments were not particularly sanguine the committee is likely to need some hard data that conditions are getting better before they start to unwind the rate cuts with payroll declines continuing it is hard right now to see how that could happen by years end
1716269 labor markets have softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress
1716270 tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters
1716271 watch the employment data carefully a reappearance of job gains could change the outlook quickly
1716272 inflation has been high spurred by earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities and some indicators of inflation expectations have been elevated
1716273 you build a case not only based on the science but also on the activity of the subject
1716274 we are continuing to move along at a very deliberate and aggressive pace here because our desire remains to complete the source selection process by the end of this year
1716275 disturbed to learn that the chinese had refused his visa we are taking the matter very seriously
1716276 we have sent in our embassy in beijing to demarche the chinese that is where we go in and say we are concerned about this and we want you to reconsider your actions we would hope that they would change their mind
1716277 part of a systemic effort by the chinese government to coerce and threaten athletes who are speaking out on behalf of the innocent people of darfur

1716279 citi field will serve as a fantastic new home for the mets for decades to come but fans will always remember shea stadium and its magical moments from the amazins world series triumph in 1969 to game 6 in 86 to hopefully a long sweet october in 2008
1716280 the seat sale and subsequent memorabilia sale will provide fans a chance to own a part of that shea stadium lore
1716281 we needed to win a game regardless of how we won it
1716282 we lost four straight and i dont think we played bad baseball until that last inning
1716283 thats not a good indication right off the bat as to how to go about that situation
1716284 youve got a four run lead and youre going out there to get three outs unfortunately i wasnt able to do that
1716285 lets not get ahead of ourselves thats how it is right now thats how its got to be nothing replaces what we had here in wagner so weve just got to hold the fort tread water down there until billy gets back
1716286 coach mike mccarthy and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction
1716287 we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner roger goodell reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1716288 mike told me hey were a better team with you on it but wanted to know if i have a problem with an open competition
1716289 i dont have a problem with competing you know that but aaron should be the starter right now because hes been out here all this time this is more than about an open competition and i can do that absolutely but this is going to be mass confusion and thats not good for this team
1716290 ill practice my butt off if it comes to that and i think we all know what the end result will be but this probably isnt going to work
1716291 they want to know if im committed but i want to know if theyre 100 percent committed the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it stuff has been said stories planted that just arent true can i get over all that i doubt it
1716292 so they can say they welcome me back but come on the way theyve treated me tells you the truth they dont want me back so lets move on i dont know where its headed well see
1716293 you know this isnt going to be easy its going to be a dogfight and i know if they do open it up to competition not a lot of people will give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be and let coach decide from there
1716294 i mean theyre booing all of us probably me mostly so yeah i take it personally
1716295 but its not the first time ive been booed and it wont be the last time
1716296 i think the organization has been put in a tough spot and its a difficult situation but were going to welcome him back and move forward as a team
1716297 sixteen years after brett favre came to the packers he is returning for a seventeenth season
1716298 aaron ross is probably the only player in the nfl whose love interest is faster than he is
1716299 i attended eagles games with my father from 1971 1987 when i moved to dc and each year my aunt a huge dallas fan came with us to the eagles cowboys game
1716300 it s a great job in a great city that s how i look at it
1716301 people say hey you re working in a tough place but i like it people care they re going to show up and cheer it s a great city for sports i realize that maybe i didn t the first couple of years but now that i ve been around and i ve looked around it s a great situation
1716302 until we have a full assessment from dr andrews im really not going to comment
1716303 all i can tell you is what you got from girardi
1716304 a lot of guys like to go see dr andrews
1716305 obviously you take a guy of jobas caliber away and you know youre going to miss him
1716306 you dont want to jeopardize their long term health and were talking about a 22 year old kid here
1716307 we are very grateful for the tremendous start we had in this game
1716308 after the great start i think we played a very very good defensive game and there were very few big chances for the united states
1716309 my glass is always half full so for us its a new experience to lose a game
1716310 im happy that its the first game and not the last so we still have two more games to go and well take out this part the second half for when we play against japan and new zealand
1716311 to some degree social networking is replacing that students are using facebook to chronicle the college experience
1716312 high school students are just as involved in myspace and it hasnt had an impact virtually every high school produces a yearbook
1716313 it really does give you a sense of what it was like to be on campus in years past
1716314 theyre losing the only written history of the year prepared by the students who lived it
1716315 there are very few yearbooks that have not experienced declines in the past few years
1716316 at this point we are still in the black but if we continue to drop in sales that becomes questionable
1716317 yearbooks come and go it all depends on the temperament at the university
1716318 developing a yearbook is an expensive thing the students just werent buying it none of the other departments wanted to pick it up
1716319 its harder to sell books than it was 15 or 20 years ago
1716320 its not all gloom and doom its a cyclical thing when theres a lot of unhappiness in society yearbook sales tend to drop off
1716321 when tradition is popular yearbooks really thrive i think where tradition reigns youre going to have a wonderful yearbook
1716322 you cannot hold facebook you cannot pass facebook on to the next generation and youre going to lose everything you put on facebook
1716323 i think its the kind of campus we have we have a strong greek community they tend to be in it a lot
1716324 you build a case not only based on the science but also on the activity of the subject
1716325 80s matchbox jilted john amp leonard cohen the big chill
1716326 dont be too alarmed even when studies come out and seem hopeless
1716327 with a few swaps and switches people really can make healthier choices at these fast food joints especially when the decisions are made before going in
1716328 many of these restaurants have the nutrition information online that you can print out and go over with your kids even before you go so that everybody is on the same page before they pull up to the drive through or head to the counter
1716329 instead of getting the fries go with the apple slices many restaurants offer carrot sticks or apple slices or no sugar added applesauce or oranges which make a big difference over deep fried fries
1716330 instead of the deep fried nuggets go for something like the grilled chicken and you will save fat grams and calories
1716331 you cant go wrong with unsweetened iced tea water or a skim milk
1716332 there needs to be a public outcry that goes far and wide
1716333 whats coming we dont know the hauling off of women and children matches anything in russia or germany
1716334 as more and more computing tasks migrate to supercomputer style clusters there is a need for software that can effectively utilize and manage the large number of processors found in these systems
1716335 all hobbits of course can cook for they begin to learn the art before their letters
1716336 the dance or the race will start in a few minutes
1716337 we have the tools we have the talent its miller time
1716338 all you have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to you
1716339 you cant get mad about anything said with smilies after it
1716340 the race for women is not deiced yet though they are giving obama a solid lead
1716341 the womens vote is obamas to consolidate the way to definitively put this election away is to take the vote that he has substantially already and put it over 50 percent
1716342 the majority of women voters polled say gender does not matter
1716343 obamas selection of a woman running mate makes no difference to 55 of women voters and mccains selection of a woman as his 2 makes no difference to 62 however obama would benefit twice as much as mccain from offering the second slot to a woman 29 of females are more likely to support obama if he picks a woman vs 15 who would be more likely to support mccain
1716344 this is very suggestive that there is a fundamental change going on in the electorate
1716345 obviously these are not good numbers for the party to be looking at democrats have always had extremely broad multifaceted registration programs
1716346 i think the key in this one is where do all these new independent voters break
1716347 i think right now youve got a guy in western pennsylvania saying i am really disgusted right now and im not going to register as a republican anymore but i really dont want this guy obama elected
1716348 i think nationally and here people are kind of tired of the way this administration has been conducting the policies of this country
1716349 it is not that people move to those areas and change positions it tends now to be a self selection of singles childless couples
1716350 major political realignment is not just controlling the branches of government
1716351 it is when you decisively do it we havent seen that in modern generations
1716352 this is not a novel to be tossed lightly aside it should be thrown with great force
1716353 i cant believe that this max cant find something real to complain about in this crazy world i think max is the bigot he obviously hates country music country singers and southerners
1716354 i think the black people would say he obama dont talk act or carry himself as a black person
1716355 but i think that thats what they would say even though the black society would pull for him i still think that they think in the back of their mind that the only reason he is in the general election is because he talks acts and carries himself as a caucasian
1716356 topical application of a lotion containing cocoa butter does not appear to reduce the likelihood of developing striae gravidarum
1716357 this is not a novel to be tossed lightly aside it should be thrown with great force
1716358 nobody is more disturbed over the use of atomic bombs than i am but i was greatly disturbed over the unwarranted attack by the japanese on pearl harbor and their murder of our prisoners of war the only language they seem to understand is the one we have been using to bombard them
1716359 the japanese were ready to surrender and it wasnt necessary to hit them with that awful thing
1716360 it is my opinion that the use of this barbarous weapon at hiroshima and nagasaki was of no material assistance in our war against japan
1716361 the use of the atomic bomb with its indiscriminate killing of women and children revolts my soul
1716362 when i asked general macarthur about the decision to drop the bomb he saw no military justification for the dropping of the bomb the war might have ended weeks earlier he said if the united states had agreed as it later did anyway to the retention of the institution of the emperor
1716363 when we didnt need to do it and we knew we didnt need to do it and they knew that we knew we didnt need to do it we used them as an experiment for two atomic bombs
1716364 we shale fight to the very last man woman and child

1716368 while touting fiscal responsibility president bush and his administration have lined the pockets of political cronies like halliburton and blackwater while calling for earmark reform the president has allowed no bid and questionable contracting throughout the federal government to dwarf earmark spending by a 10 to 1 ratio if were going to get serious about putting our nations fiscal house in order lets talk about putting an end to billions in no bid contract awards to unaccountable contractors lets talk about the number of lucrative contracts and bonuses being paid for duties never performed promises never fulfilled and contracts falsely described as complete and lets talk about reforming the federal contracting system so that we can take on the real waste fraud and abuse in our federal government ive proposed a comprehensive overhaul to root out corruption in no bid contracts and other shady deals reforms must include the following

1716382 la situaci n aqu est empeorando es incluso peor que la de irak si el gobierno estadounidense env a a m s soldados la violencia aumentar por ejemplo cuando vemos a un grupo de soldados estadounidenses caminando por aqu no nos hace sentir seguros nuestras fuerzas afganas son capaces de proveerle seguridad a afganist n el gobierno estadounidense deber a enfocarse en otras necesidades de los afganos no en las fuerzas armadas

1716385 esta postura significa que no existe ni la m s m nima esperanza de que haya cambios en la pol tica exterior de estados unidos en lo que respecta al conflicto rabe israel y esto significa que estamos ante una nica pol tica estadounidense y el pueblo palestino deber a depender de s mismo y del mundo rabe y musulm n para enfrentar esta pol tica estadounidense que est siendo adoptada tanto por el partido dem crata como por el republicano
1716386 a nadie le gusta la guerra reconozco las tremendas dificultades de afganist n pero tanto a mi pa s como al de ustedes le interesa que la primera misi n de la otan fuera de las fronteras de europa sea un xito debemos hacer esto por el pueblo de afganist n y por nuestra seguridad conjunta estados unidos no puede hacerlo solo

1716408 reveals that a member of the army team involved was wearing a tabard marked with the red cross emblem before the operation had even begun suggesting intentional misuse
1716409 we need everybody in this party to get behind this effort to turn out thousands and thousands of volunteers in every single state in the country to hit the streets and go register millions of new people that weekend alone
1716410 its not about whether or not we will get barack obama elected it is about whether or not we will have a progressive majority in this country for decades to come
1716411 voter mobilization voter registration online organizing community outreach and paid advertising
1716412 we expect our demographic to turn out at 80 percent
1716413 if we dont use this opportunity if we dont do this right shame on us
1716414 because we will never have it as good as we have it right now
1716415 they said the way you used to win down here is you pay off the ministers you pay off the state senators and the state reps and you have some chicken dinners
1716416 that didnt jibe with our candidates message or his bio or anything that he said since he started to run for president or started running for the state senate
1716417 we asked them to support us and bring their social networks and hold house meetings
1716418 in those meetings we were testing our first contacts leadership and then we asked people to be team leaders
1716419 i was a skeptic of jeremy and his crew in south carolina and whether he could build enough capacity to get us across the finish line
1716420 i quickly lost that skepticism and i saw the numbers that they were creating
1716421 it was about building capacity to have the resources to do our persuasion and to turn out the vote i give jeremy and his team a tremendous amount of credit for building this field model and implementing this in a way that a state like south carolina has never seen before every state is a field state if you know how to organize the field
1716422 the top lesson was training and empowering people made the biggest difference
1716423 this wasnt just making phone calls and telling volunteers that you are going to make a lot of them
1716424 if our organizers who are paid in our states made phone calls all day we would not get it done
1716425 we do it by building relationships we rely on telling peoples stories to create more connections we listen more than we talk in organizing it is important to take the time to hear what people have to say about the campaign about politics generally
1716426 they believe this is real they dont believe it is a game they believe they can get it done
1716427 this was a welcomed opportunity for so many of us to get involved in when you have a candidate that really believed in building this from the ground up
1716428 because when you have people who are out there in teams you see they come together in a way that precinct captains on his or her own arent able to do
1716429 the fourth thing was to integrate the technology to support this
1716430 the fact that when you sign up on our e mail list you are automatically on our voter file and we can follow up with you and know when you signed up and what you are interested in on election day in south carolina we had an unprecedented number of cell phone numbers people that had opted in that we were able to text and remind people to vote and they were able to text back in when they voted
1716431 i was looking for a place where there was an effort to get change from the top down and the bottom up at the same time
1716432 i saw that jeremy recognized and the organizers recognized that the awakening it takes for people to take on the responsibility for really being citizens is not something that happens at a mass level
1716433 it is something that happens one living room at a time one kitchen table at a time and this campaign was investing in that effort
1716434 the brilliance of the church was we were organizing on abortion and prayer in schools and it wasnt just focused on washington it was focused on our local community they realized for everyday people to be involved the issues need to connect with our values and we need to have a very local way and a meaningful way to get involved at the local level that isnt just forwarding e mails to our congress people in washington
1716435 because he built a movement not because of his policies dont ever criticize him for that it is because ronald reagan built a movement thats what we will do thats what we are doing
1716436 over three days in early june we trained them how to be authentic leaders themselves and share their story
1716437 we train them how to build relationships how to do one on one conversations with people how to lead house meetings how to do voter registration because we have a 50 state voter registration project
1716438 do what used to be truly american which is sit and talk about what do we want for ourselves our country and what is our responsibility
1716439 the fellows arent just college students looking for something to do over the summer
1716440 they are teachers and airline pilots and firefighters and people who have decided that they are willing to take the risk and make sacrifices to change the country
1716441 the night barack accepts the nomination we will have house parties
1716442 we will ask those people to register voters on the next few days
1716443 we saw through the 2008 primaries that we had voter registration opportunities that never existed to us in this party
1716444 we learned through experience that our efforts on the ground to register voters was really really important
1716445 but do they have the infrastructure to reach a million disenfranchised voters who would not register otherwise
1716446 we cant be so single minded that this is about barack obama because it is not
1716447 it is about the american people and the principles that are important to us whether or not we will get health care passed whether or not we will stop the war in iraq whether or not we are going to build an education system that we can be more proud of there are a lot of things that we as progressives hold fundamentally dear and if this is about a game we are not being all that successful and neither is our opposition but if it is about a movement that can fundamentally change the way we do business in this country at every single level then we will be successful

1716464 this is a crucial issue for archaeology because if chickens were in south america before the spanish arrived it means people must have brought them there across the breadth of the pacific ocean
1716465 we know there was at least some contact between pre european polynesians and americans because the south american sweet potato occurs in polynesia and the bottle gourd from asia and ultimately africa occurs in south america
1716466 however to date there has been no conclusive archaeological evidence for the presence of polynesians in south america making recent claims for presence of pre columbian chickens in south america a key issue
1716467 the study found no support for previous claims for a polynesian introduction of chickens to south america
1716468 this does not mean that polynesians and people in the americas did not have contact in the past just that the current archaeological evidence does not suggest that chickens were part of the package
1716469 we are extremely pleased with these contracts as this indicates that our turnaround in security is giving us traction in terms of securing new business we also try to build strong relationships with our clients and value repeat business such as in this case
1716470 four years ago we committed to a core strategy of growing acquisitively and organically and of ensuring a diversified group within strong growth areas all our businesses are now performing over the last three years we have delivered consistent growth with a 27 compounded annual increase in revenue and a 44 compounded annual increase in earnings per share earlier this year our focus on acquisitions was also successful with jasco announcing a major transaction with afrocentric this transformed jasco from a black controlled to a black owned company
1716471 this transaction transforms us into a larger and a black owned entity ready to take up the new opportunities these partners bring to the table
1716472 hes done well in a couple of games is keen ambitious and wants to do well in his career
1716473 there are always one or two tricky questions but ill answer them as honestly as i can
1716474 he has played in the scottish premier hes only 20 and has got a great left foot and has a big future
1716475 it was a great result for us we have improved a lot since early in the year and this win should stand to the team
1716476 armagh will be another good team being an ulster side theyll be very physical
1716477 aucune rencontre de la sorte nest pr vue et nous navons pas demand une telle entrevue
1716478 there are only eight teams left tyrone have an ulster championship medal in their back pocket and probably have big ambitions of winning the all ireland but they still have to beat us this will be a true championship match theres no second chance there will be a big prize for one team and huge disappointment for the other
1716479 we were hugely disappointed but the players knew that our failure to convert our chances cost us
1716480 it was a missed opportunity we wanted to give the people of roscommon something to shout about we took a lot of positives from it even though we know that we should have won the game
1716481 there a big prize on offer our players would relish the chance of playing in an all ireland semi final probably in croke park were treating this game as a new competition weve refocussed and tried to pick up morale since the mayo game
1716482 theyve tyrone have some very natural players who have been operating in an underage system that has been tried and trusted theyre at it a lot longer than we are and theyre constantly producing players who are balanced and are very comfortable on the ball
1716483 for a player to turn around and refuse his final pay packet and instead ask to sponsor a youth player is unheard of
1716484 this shows the type of man that don is and what football means to him
1716485 regrettably xls decision to cease operating the gatwick route comes as a significant disappointment to the airport and passengers in both the london and west of ireland regions as well as to the tourism and business stakeholders in the region
1716486 the remainder of the year will be a difficult time for the industry as a whole given current oil prices and economic outlook however as always the airport will continue to look at every opportunity available to seek a replacement carrier on the route and to sustain and develop more routes at ireland west knock
1716487 we are pleased with the growth we have managed to achieve so far this year and we will continue to build for the long term future
1716488 we think of technology as a tool to serve our clients their borrowers and investors
1716489 but technology alone wont stop the fraud abuse and unscrupulous practices targeting seniors it takes a team of dedicated committed and highly trained staff to protect borrowers and to preserve their assets and by protecting the borrowers were also protecting our clients and the investors

1716511 there will be five consultant surgeon posts in all with joint services between the two hospitals the ongoing development and functioning of this joint department will be determined by the five permanent postholders once all are in place and following a period of operation
1716512 one consultant surgeon post has already been advertised which will be shared between the two hospitals the hse will now move to fill two other consultant surgeon posts on a similar basis to create a joint department
1716513 in relation to the a amp e department in roscommon the status quo remains for the present and our focus is now on recruiting the consultants to establish an effective joint department of surgery and anaesthesia
1716514 we are very pleased with this great news and we welcome it with open arms we are delighted that surgical anaesthetic and a amp e services will be retained for the foreseeable future and its wonderful news to know that we will have two surgeons at roscommon
1716515 however we would also emphasise strongly that it is still a case of use the services or lose them so we are urging people to use the services at roscommon county hospital gps must send patients to the hospital and patients must request that their surgery is carried out at roscommon there are tow general surgeons there that are very capable of carrying out not all but most types of operations
1716516 i wish to congratulate minister michael finneran for his courageous and successful stance against the hses proposal to downgrade services at roscommon county hospital
1716517 if this ludicrous plan were to proceed it would spell the end of all planning and development in the towns and villages situated on the shannon eg carrick on shannon roosky lanesboro newtowncashel athlone limerick etc it would further compromise future water supplies for all of the aforementioned towns and villages
1716518 immediate drops in water levels throughout the shannon catchment area will bring about the swift total and irreversible demise of tourism leisure activities angling agriculture hotel and accommodation interests and the destruction of the shannons fragile ecology will be damaged to such an extent that it will never recover even if the water abstraction were to be discontinued all feeder streams which are the spawning grounds for nearly all fish life will be dry in a matter of months
1716519 a water abstraction license is a reserved function of any local authority and the members of dublin county council are there to be convinced that this proposal is not acceptable to the members in longford westmeath roscommon and the other 15 counties that have riparian access to the river shannon
1716520 since all of the oireachtas members in the local constituencies have grounded their opposition to this proposal the local elected members can convince their party counterparts in the d il and seanad to convey this message to the aforementioned minister

1716553 we had a new patch put in place in the affected areas by midday last friday but we now have a re emergence of a similar problem in the brisbane area
1716554 were not sure how long it will take to fix this problem again but we hope soon
1716555 nokias latest version of the software was in effect contaminated we had a bug in the software so we have had to roll it back
1716556 the issue for us is that we have put the upgrade in other areas and have had no problems whatsoever so its a bit of a lottery
1716557 there was extensive testing on both our parts and we were also assured by nokia siemens that the software would work in different network environments
1716558 but when we went live it was a different story
1716559 now were just hoping the patch will hold we cant say for sure whether or not we will have more issues over the next week in brisbane
1716560 were proud of both companies shared goal of providing a superior mobile service in australia experts from both companies are working in partnership to resolve any remaining network issues as is always the case when any outage occurs
1716561 we have told nokia to fly out some engineers because we certainly wont be flying them here
1716562 we do have some service level guarantees with them and we will clearly be looking at whether in fact the software they have given us is up to scratch
1716563 we are not looking to sue them on this what we are doing is looking to work with them to fix it
1716564 sie hat noch ein jahr h chstens man kann nichts mehr f r sie machen
1716565 if youve done something right no one will know that youve done anything at all
1716566 nave a nice day or not the choice is yours
1716567 if youve done something right no one will know that youve done anything at all
1716568 while we expect continued housing and economic weakness will affect our overall performance this year we continue to maintain a surplus over all regulatory capital requirements
1716569 we remain committed to raising 5 5 billion dollars of new capital and will evaluate raising capital beyond this amount depending on our needs and as market conditions mandate
1716570 freddie macs liquidity position remains strong as a result of its continued access to the debt markets at attractive spreads the companys cash and investments portfolio of approximately 70 billion dollars and an unencumbered agency mortgage related securities portfolio of approximately 470 billion dollars which could serve as collateral for additional borrowings
1716571 this partnership is the best of both worlds for me and my management team
1716572 we can keep control of our creative challenges and operations while accelerating our growth doing projects all over the world
1716573 agriums exceptional second quarter earnings are a result of strong performance across all business units and the outlook for all our product lines continues to strengthen
1716574 this quarters results are a reflection both of the quality of our assets and the benefit of diversifying throughout the agricultural value chain
1716575 if we dont get a strong number oil prices will likely fall further
1716576 if we dont get a strong number oil prices will likely fall further
1716577 elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters
1716578 i expect prices to fall to between 100 and 110 by the end of the year
1716579 only four in 10 of those polled would divulge to friends and family how much debt they have or how much they earn
1716580 this is an opportunistic and entirely unwelcome attempt to acquire lonmin at a price which undervalues its unique assets
1716581 marks the next step in our strategy to develop a significant platinum business and add further scale and diversification to our portfolio
1716582 xstrata believes that lonmins operations are attractive but that a significant transformation of operating and management practices is required to return lonmin to its former growth trajectory over time
1716583 xstratas offer reflects the operational weakness that lonmin has seen which has made lonmin vulnerable
1716584 the share price fell to a level which i think does significantly understate the value of those assets if they are run properly
1716585 xstrata is easily big enough they can afford to buy lonmin certainly
1716586 this was a quarter of strong progress against our strategic imperatives especially the significant acceleration of our wireless business
1716587 wireless saw improvements in financial and operating metrics in the quarter including the highest level of postpaid net activations since the fourth quarter of 2005 significant growth in total net activations improvements in churn cost of acquisition and postpaid average revenue per unit and double digit growth in operating revenue and ebitda
1716588 disappointed with our high speed internet business this quarter but we are taking action to improve performance in the second half of the year
1716589 the record results achieved in the second quarter continue the upward momentum that aecon has established over the last two years
1716590 and our record backlog is a strong positive signal that the best is yet to come for aecon
1716591 the economy may already be in recession yet the monetary policy committee feels unable to act given that inflation is well above target and rising
1716592 essentially the u k economy is already in a recession or close to a recession and all the forward indicators suggest a significant weakening
1716593 while headline inflation is high it is likely to fall
1716594 these results reflect superior efforts achieved by all employees to continuously improve our operations
1716595 despite a weaker economy and a high canadian dollar our three divisions increased their sales during the first quarter and more importantly all generated a positive net income
1716596 i wouldnt have said this at the end of a quarter but after four quarters its time to take stock bnp paribas is clearly different from the rest
1716597 with the exception of goldman sachs there is no other bank in the world where the impact of the subprime crisis has been weaker
1716598 the fall in the readiness to place orders in the industrial sector seen in recent months is continuing
1716599 demand from abroad is slowing more sharply than domestic demand which is also on a downwards trajectory as a result prospects for industrial production all in all have worsened
1716600 the support from already received orders is drying up very quickly suggesting an end to the boom days in industrial production is close at hand
1716601 likely that the euro zone will be the first major economy to fall into recession
1716602 this was a quarter of strong progress against our strategic imperatives especially the significant acceleration of our wireless business
1716603 we were disappointed with our high speed internet business this quarter but we are taking action to improve performance in the second half of the year
1716604 if we dont get a strong number oil prices will likely fall further
1716605 elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters
1716606 i expect prices to fall to between us 100 and us 110 by the end of the year
1716607 it will force me to steal in order to survive because of these high prices
1716608 there is no public transport the mining industry is closing down
1716609 i do support the message not the strike they shouldnt have stopped the transport
1716610 the issues they raised are not populist they are realistic and they are surmountable
1716611 on the other hand if we ignore the plight of the poor people were going to do it at our peril because this is a cry from the working and poor classes to do something dramatic
1716612 this improvement was primarily due to improved results at gulfstream park santa anita park and our real estate operations partially offset by disappointing results at the maryland jockey club
1716613 notwithstanding this modest improvement in ebitda for the quarter we recognize the need for further significant improvement in our operating results as we also focus on dramatically reducing our debt levels
1716614 although we continue to take steps to implement our debt elimination plan u s real estate and credit markets have continued to demonstrate weakness in 2008 and we do not expect to complete our plan on the originally contemplated time schedule
1716615 not expect that we will be able to complete asset sales at acceptable prices as quickly or for amounts as originally contemplated
1716616 we are in the process of reconsidering whether to sell certain of the assets that were originally identified for disposition under the debt elimination plan
1716617 as a result of these developments combined with our upcoming debt maturities and our operational funding requirements we will again need to seek extensions or additional funds in the short term from one or more possible sources

1716628 toen ik begreep dat ze met jort in de polder woonde dacht ik al die houdt het daar niet vol
1716629 ik heb vaak op het punt gestaan de trein te pakken en haar te gaan zoeken maar dan denk ik wat als ze de deur in mijn gezicht dichtslaat
1716630 ineens was ze iemand had ze fans die om een handtekening vroegen
1716631 ik maakte mij zorgen want ik merkte dat de showbizz een en al schijn is die bemoeienis was voor haar juist een reden zich van mij af te keren
1716632 het is gissen maar ik denk dat onze boodschap is aangekomen bij de ouders nederland accepteert niet dat kinderen aan het werk zijn en niet naar school kunnen gaan maar een europese aanpak is nodig omdat het probleem niet alleen in nederland speelt
1716633 nu het zomervakantie is zien we ze wel weer maar voor die tijd waren ze weg

1716635 we looked at a lot of places before we got here
1716636 rivers had been the projected starter at weak side linebacker along with middle linebacker dhani jones and rashad jeanty on the strong side but free agent brandon johnson signed in the off season from arizona has been playing well in rivers absence and made a strong showing over the weekend
1716637 we are committed to resolving the issues identified in the letter and remain committed to working cooperatively with the state and the tallevast community on the environmental cleanup
1716638 so far as we know this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever charged in this country
1716639 had not received inquiries from credit card companies or customers about these alleged activities
1716640 if i go right at dusk with the old trees it feels like halloween
1716641 if someones in here walking and theres a mourner or funeral they just use another part of the cemetery
1716642 and its well maintained has some shade and people are always visible on the property so they feel safe
1716643 it doesnt sound right you go there to pray and visit not to have a good time
1716644 jewish law says you have to respect those who are resting and not do things that arent in accordance with what youre there for to take a walk for no reason is not the nicest thing to do
1716645 even though they can be a place of peace some spirits are not at rest and havent resolved their earth journey
1716646 so there can be negative energies and it could make you sad without your even knowing it
1716647 or the people left behind could be grieving so intensely that the deceased is not at peace to leave
1716648 i leave here feeling more peaceful and they dont bother me in the least they never say a word
1716649 one of the great benefits in moving downtown near the wortham would be being in close proximity to the wortham all the time instead of having to go back and forth between two locations

1716655 the decision to part company has been taken jointly and has no bearing on ljungbergs fitness which he proved during euro 2008
1716656 we respect freddie ljungbergs position and are pleased we could reach agreement and wish him all the best in the future
1716657 i gave my all at west ham and enjoyed my time there but the decision is the best for the both of us
1716658 previous findings have shown that fish and fish oil can help prevent stroke but this is one of the only studies that looks at fishs effect on silent brain lesions in healthy older people

1716661 attempting to collect a debt for a forensic sexual battery exam in violation of florida statutes
1716662 deeply regrets the clerical mistake which resulted in an inadvertent billing error for one of our patients
1716663 i think this is something that can be pretty traumatic for her to have to experience remembering about the assault every time shes contacted about payment and she shouldnt have been charged in the first place
1716664 im dong this so that theres no more harassment to any victims in the state of florida

1716667 he writes the worst english that i have ever encountered it reminds me of a string of wet sponges it reminds me of tattered washing on the line it reminds me of stale bean soup of college yells of dogs barking idiotically through endless nights it is so bad that a sort of grandeur creeps into it it drags itself out of the dark abysm of pish and crawls insanely up to the topmost pinnacle of posh it is rumble and bumble it is flap and doodle it is balder and dash
1716668 the most destructive element in the human mind is fear
1716669 you gain strength courage and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face you must do the thing which you think you cannot do
1716670 better keep yourself clean and bright youre the window through which you must see the world
1716671 bring ing openness and choice to the client and desktop side of the it environment is one of the next things to explode in the march for linux
1716672 the lesser of two evils to me was to not vaccinate him and build his immune system the way god intended
1716673 we are always concerned about the number of children who do not receive immunizations
1716674 they are not aware of the potential seriousness of these diseases
1716675 we really need to work to educate the public to dispel rumors and provide scientific evidence to what is the truth and what is not
1716676 i did not want to see my son become a statistic
1716677 we did our research and do not feel it is appropriate to vaccinate
1716678 wie alle relevanten internet anbieter setzt auch das sylter fernsehen auf eine kontinuierliche weiterentwicklung
1716679 the change we must change to the change we hold dear
1716680 i liked the personalized service the hotel is small and they remember you i got good advice on touring that allowed me to do what i wanted and they saved me money
1716681 and elis two sons hophni and phinehas were there with the ark of the covenant of god
1716682 operation northwoods which had the written approval of the chairman and every member of the joint chiefs of staff called for innocent people to be shot on american streets for boats carrying refugees fleeing cuba to be sunk on the high seas for a wave of violent terrorism to be launched in washington d c miami and elsewhere people would be framed for bombings they did not commit planes would be hijacked using phony evidence all of it would be blamed on castro thus giving lemnitzer and his cabal the excuse as well as the public and international backing they needed to launch their war
1716683 we believe that itll present a very compelling alternative and bring openness to the world of small business which has not historically been true
1716684 the client side of the it environment is one the last bastions of proprietary technology it has been disproportionately dominated by one vendor
1716685 i can hardly name an area where we need more choice
1716686 new harvest potatoes cucumbers sea beans borage ice plant flowers

1716688 more protests pickets counter protests media blitzes and more the rest of the week
1716689 darn i will be off task for the rest of the day
1716690 lets just take money out of savings and get a new one
1716691 will third party candidates make the difference in top races
1716692 the gop the so called conservative party has racked up record spending deficits refused to secure our borders increased government intrusion and sponsors policies that send jobs off shore
1716693 while the democrats the so called party of the working man have shown many of the same characteristics which of course coincide with the partys mantra of more taxes and big government
1716694 i have spoken with many in this area that are concerned of losing their jobs or have lost jobs and now an economy in turmoil has rightfully elevated their concerns it is obvious to me only multi national corporations and special interest are represented in d c not all citizens
1716695 the gambling industry i said years ago is not sustainable at this accelerating pace
1716696 no presidential candidate should visit las vegas without condemning organized gambling
1716697 illegal immigration is a huge problem in the united states that will only worsen if we continue to play games instead of getting serious about real reform
1716698 border fences are expensive distractions paid for by taxpayers from addressing the causes of illegal immigration
1716699 building a fence wont fix these problems that are at the heart of why people come to this country illegally
1716700 people are breaking the law and entering illegally because it is easier to swim the rio grande than to climb the mountain of paperwork
1716701 the solution to defending our border and sovereignty must make it easier for peaceful people to enter the country legally
1716702 we understand that we must have a secure border and keep out those who present a threat to national health or security
1716703 immigration policy should be a realistic reflection of our society
1716704 too much regulation hurts our economy by limiting the pool of cheap labor and creates incentives to enter the country illegally too little leaves the united states open to harm immigration reform should balance the needs of our economy with the need for domestic security a border fence does not fully address this need
1716705 unfortunately theres been this story out that were hiding something and of course as soon as that story goes out then people speculate and speculation leads to all kinds of wonderful discoveries that i wish wed made but we havent
1716706 heard about the recent news reports implying i may have found martian life those reports are incorrect
1716707 reports claiming there was a white house briefing are also untrue and incorrect
1716708 my sources plural said that the white house has been briefed but that also includes just being notified such as via email it doesnt necessarily mean sitting down with a powerpoint display
1716709 i cant help it if the whole world runs off and says life was discovered on mars it is extremely clear that life has not been discovered on mars
1716710 the different perchlorate salts have properties that may bear on the way things work on mars if and thats a really big if the results of our little teaspoon full of soil are representative of the whole planet or even significant proportions of the planet
1716711 a collection of some of the most commonly used open source applications optimized for the sun solaris os platform
1716712 now the real nature of calvinistic soteriology becomes plain it is no artificial oddity nor a product of overbold logic its central confession that god saves sinners that christ redeemed us by his blood is the witness both of the bible and of the believing heart
1716713 e ad anticipare lalbum ancora senza titolo i cure stanno registrando il loro
1716714 honey breakfast is on the table i left early to go grocery shopping love you
1716715 well you came home around 3 am drunk and delirious broke some crockery puked in the hall and gave yourself a black eye when you stumbled into the door
1716716 so why is everything in order and so clean and breakfast is on the table waiting for me i should expect a big quarrel with her
1716717 obamas transformation if you go by his campaign so far would mean higher income taxes higher social security taxes higher investment taxes higher corporate taxes massive new domestic spending and a healthcare plan that perhaps could be the next step to a full scale single payer system is that what most americans want someone who will fulfill a democratic policy wish list
1716718 obamas proposal would impose social security taxes on income above 250 000 per year he would continue to exempt income between 102 000 and 250 000 from social security taxes
1716719 i would roll back the bush tax cuts for those making over 250 000
1716720 sen obama wants to raise the long term capital gains rate for families making more than 250 000 to around 20 percent or somewhat higher but not above the 28 percent level it reached during the reagan presidency an obama economic adviser says the same rate would apply to most dividend income for these investors
1716721 what we ought to tax is dirty energy like coal and to a lesser extent natural gas
1716722 ntufs third round of costing out the candidates platforms since january 29 found that clinton would increase yearly federal spending by 289 6 billion compared to sen obamas d il 343 9 billion both significantly higher totals from the last update on march 3
1716723 as presidential campaign pace quickens candidates race ahead with bigger federal budget promises updated study shows
1716724 by our calculations using figures supplied by the campaigns sen hillary rodham clinton n y has proposed new spending and tax breaks that would amount to almost 265 billion a year when fully implemented while the initiatives proposed by sen barack obama ill total nearly 333 billion
1716725 frankly says hes not sure hed bring it down at all in four years
1716726 barack obama says john mccains plan to balance the budget doesnt add up easy for him to say its not a goal hes even trying to reach not only does obama say he wont eliminate the deficit in his first term as mccain aims to do he frankly says hes not sure hed bring it down at all in four years considering his own spending plans
1716727 both obama and clinton promised to not raise taxes on those making less than 200 000 or 250 000 a year they both just emasculated their domestic programs returning the rich to their clinton era tax rates will yield at best 40 billion a year in revenue its impossible to fund a health care plan let alone anything else with that kind of money the consequences are clear if elected they will have to break their pledge and thus destroy their credibility or run a minimalist administration
1716728 green jobs and green technology will be vital to our economic future there is no reason that the u s should not be a leader in developing and deploying these new technologies
1716729 coal produces the majority of our electricity today some believe that marketing viable clean coal technologies could be over 15 years away john mccain believes that this is too long to wait and we need to commit significant federal resources to the science research and development that advance this critical technology once commercialized the u s can then export these technologies to countries like china that are committed to using their coal creating new american jobs and allowing the u s to play a greater role in the international green economy
1716730 nuclear power is a proven zero emission source of energy and it is time we recommit to advancing our use of nuclear power currently nuclear power produces 20 of our power but the u s has not started construction on a new nuclear power plant in over 30 years china india and russia have goals of building a combined total of over 100 new plants and we should be able to do the same it is also critical that the u s be able to build the components for these plants and reactors within our country so that we are not dependent on foreign suppliers with long wait times to move forward with our nuclear plans
1716731 this reform will simplify the tax code reward activity in the u s and make us more competitive with other countries a permanent credit will provide an incentive to innovate and remove uncertainty at a time when our companies need to be more competitive we need to provide a permanent incentive to innovate and remove the uncertainty now hanging over businesses as they make r amp d investment decisions
1716732 according to the department of energy wind could provide as much as one fifth of electricity by 2030 the u s solar energy industry continued its double digit annual growth rate in 2006 to develop these and other sources of renewable energy will require that we rationalize the current patchwork of temporary tax credits that provide commercial feasibility john mccain believes in an even handed system of tax credits that will remain in place until the market transforms sufficiently to the point where renewable energy no longer merits the taxpayers dollars
1716733 history shows us that even a temporary increase in supply will immediately lower oil prices
1716734 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too only im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot
1716735 but then that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means im running for president so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude
1716736 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
1716737 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
1716738 from reading the answer about interstate negotiations about slavery before the onset of the war between the states the remark alluded to was
1716739 again remember that most people only know the name from newspaper articles
1716740 again germ theory is new stuff most people have little clue about genetics or biogenesis so this silly question is seriously answered
1716741 most people still believed there must be a vast elephant graveyard in unexplored africa remember that we are back in the age of
1716742 sellers of firewater to red indians a generation earlier hid it from the government agents in flasks hidden in their long legged riding boots
1716743 in may when a mccain adviser proposed a series of pre convention appearances at town hall meetings obama said i think thats a great idea obviously we would have to think through the logistics on that but if i have the opportunity to debate substantive issues before the voters with john mccain thats something that i am going to welcome
1716744 outwardly a tiger it is made of paper unable to withstand the wind and the rain
1716745 ill let my wall street cronies get their hands on your safety net money so they can do to it what they did to everything else they touched
1716746 mr asbahi has informed the campaign that he no longer wishes to serve in his volunteer position and we are in the process of searching for a new national arab american and muslim american outreach coordinator
1716747 searching for a new national arab american and muslim american outreach coordinator
1716748 when the commitment of the democratic party and the hopeful spirit of the american people cone together we have the power to change this country and transform the world but to bring about this change we so desperately need we have to overcome the forces of fear and division that the other side has made a central part of their campaign
1716749 working together united around the values and principles that we share as democrats we can move beyond yesterdays policies but only if our party has the resources to make our message of hope heard far and wide across this country thats why i hope you will seize this moment of great opportunity for our party and our nation by rushing a generous contribution make no mistake it will require an enormous amount of resources to build the national grassroots movement that is as the heart of our campaign for change
1716750 obama is bipartisan so long as that means asking republicans to take incremental steps toward his own broader goals
1716751 when it comes to compromising with the other side however obama says take a hike
1716752 the real obama fundamentally he is a big government redistributionist
1716753 perhaps the most interesting finding of these polls is that mccain has expanded his leads on nearly every issue he had previously had the advantage on while obamas leads have diminished over the past two weeks

1716777 we are proud to bring to you a great fight featuring two great fighters the young lion undefeated middleweight champion kelly pavlik from youngstown ohio and a legend your legend from philadelphia bernard hopkins
1716778 kelly pavlik is building the young fan base that the sport needs kelly always wants the biggest challenge out there and he is taking on a legend that is a heck of a test id like to thank kelly pavlik he didnt have to take this fight but he did
1716779 on the other side of the dais is a first ballot hall of famer bernard hopkins like kelly bernard always wants the biggest challenge he is taking on an undefeated ko artist in kelly pavlik this will be a great fight will bernard hopkins be the fighter to derail the man who is kelly pavlik
1716780 i appreciate kelly pavliks stride and how he has come along as a fighter people think he is new to philly but i know hes been here in philadelphia as an amateur bernard was getting ready for simon brown he is no surprise to us and we know we have to work hard people overlook his skills because of his power we have our work cut out for us
1716781 as i look at the tv i see an old dog named brett favre who like me still got swagger at 40 i am not the only one still standing dont look for me to retire i have a long distance deal with brett favre ill retire when brett favre retires
1716782 i this fight we have two blue collar guys two construction workers fighting for a sandwich after 9 hours of work i respect what this guy pavlik has done he is my successor and he got it the middleweight title the old fashioned way like i did but i have to do my job i am not afraid of a ghost
1716783 this is a hurt business and ive been successful at it for 20 years i have confidence from my last fight but i lost you say people just said i lost i am coming in with a controlled anger and confidence yesterday is in the past i am not showing my age i am a seasoned veteran who has fought every style and has a plan to take the other guys best weapon and use it against him
1716784 pavlik is known for having a great right hand but i have one of the best defenses in the sport the name of the game is to take what he does best and use it against him thats what i do best
1716785 atlantic city has been good to me if this is my last visit on my terms not kelly pavliks terms i want to put on a great fight i am looking for kelly pavlik to bring his a game i want to fight him at his best at the end of the day whoever has the best game plan will win the fight
1716786 bernard hopkins didnt have to take this fight but he did i expect him to be fully prepared bernard proved himself with slappy joe calzaghe i thought he won he has a win over winky wright and has had two close fights with jermain taylor we know he will be fully prepared
1716787 people asked me why i took this fight and why fight at 170 i wanted to fight the best i wanted to fight calzaghe supposedly the best fighter pound for pound but there is no way we could get him then someone mentioned bernard hopkins we train the same way for every fight i need to be at my best and i expect a tough fight it is a pleasure to be in the ring with bernard hopkins
1716788 he came up the same way as me we both fought our way up i knocked out tough jose luis zertuche and edison miranda i took chances and beat miranda i fought jermain taylor with no tune up fight and then i fought him a second time it was a hard road
1716789 there was no one else to fight calzaghe wont fight that hopkins was the only fight i had he couldnt weight 160 so were fighting at 170 im 62

1716844 for immigrant students who spend all day in english taught classes where they are struggling to understand and struggling to be able to express themselves or participate it is a welcome and needed relief to be able to relax and participate in social interactions without facing the language barrier
1716845 it is important for us to recognize that for an immigrant holding onto ones home language using ones home language is important to identity important to communication with family and community when immigrants use their home language it does not mean they are rejecting english immigrants overwhelmingly want to become english proficient there is no contradiction here people can and in most places in the world people do have two or more languages

1716850 roberto clemente the puerto rican baseball legend he did a lot to build baseball diamonds all over latin america he was also very popular because he was the first hispanic player to win an mvp award
1716851 because baseball is so popular in latin america players have moved into the major leagues here and thats angered some of the african american and caucasian players because now they cant get into the show although we know that if youre not good enough to play the game youre not going to play at all i think a lot of latin players have a lot more drive and they want to succeed more
1716852 mexican americans and sports a reader on athletics and barrio life
1716853 there is an increase of latino fans because they see more players like them out on the diamond so they start to come
1716854 i think that to older african americans who can remember back to jackie robinson in 1947 breaking the color barrier baseball is still important
1716855 but the younger african americans are no longer as much into baseball
1716856 i think now he has started to be able to visualize things until a quarterback can see images in his head when he is reading play calls then he has not really learned it yet so i think he is able to see the play in his minds eye now which is important
1716857 in this offense you have to learn what everybody does
1716858 once you learn the concepts of the offense and what is going on then you can be successful because there is a lot going on we get put in a situation where you have several routes in the package that can change based on coverage so you just have to know what is going on and where you are going with the football it took a lot of studying but once you get the concepts down it is pretty simple
1716859 you sit back and look and thad knows the offense better than any offense we have had
1716860 he has been running it perfectly we went out in the summer and did pass drills he didnt need his card he just calls the play he knows the situational aspects everyone understands their role and holds themselves accountable if we do what we are supposed to do i dont think anyone can stop us
1716861 they are really sharp they are out there getting their assignments done they are leading us like they are suppose to and i can not ask for more than that
1716862 he has a lot of game experience which is important thats hard to teach
1716863 he has already been in tough environments in acc games and played against really good people and he has thrown the ball well in the past he has made good decisions with the ball and had good touchdown to interception ratios so hopefully we can continue that
1716864 asack is a big strong guy that is athletic and can run
1716865 i think his passing is better than what people initially think he is more accurate with the ball then what you initially think when you watch him he is a guy that is tough and can make plays with his feet and make plays throwing the ball
1716866 he is an athletic quarterback as far as pocket passers go i like where he is with his foot work and i like where he is right now with his understanding with limited reps
1716867 we just got sean in so were anxious to learn more about him but he has got a lot of the tools the size the intelligence and the arm strength
1716868 he has got a long way to go to learn the offense but he has a lot of tools
1716869 the guy knows football he can throw the heck out of the football he is a pretty smart player once he gets some experience and gets to know the system he is going to be a very good player

1716895 it seemed to me to be like a product of extreme sexism and i kept thinking to myself god if this was just like kal penn or george clooney or any of the other obama surrogates or supporters there wouldnt be any question about it nobody would even talk about it i was merely trying to express my delight at obamas commitment to his campaign in every aspect and his interest and his support in his surrogates and his staff and his fellows and how wonderful and refreshing that is and it was manipulated into such an unfortunate media frenzy of kind of a nonstory

1716962 a pattern interrupt is taking a step back from our normal habits and seeing what is really happening
1716963 a person enters a pattern interrupt because they are no longer able to function in the normal pattern with their heightened awareness you cannot really go back because you know more now if you return it would be painful what you have been able to integrate during the pattern interrupt you can apply when you connect up with a new receptor site

1716973 mispronunciation is more than a challenge its also a danger
1716974 if you pronounce it wrong you may end up with the wrong drug
1716975 as drugs proliferate they start to sound alike like celexa and celebrex
1716976 its just going to get worse with increases in the number of drugs and in the number of unfamiliar names
1716977 as far as pronunciation of words my experience is that its pretty much all over the place

1717013 if you know your rugby you will realise that ruan has not played at fly half much this year
1717014 we have good relations with the provincial coaches and we indicate to them in which positions we would like to see the players operate i believe this is a more open and transparent way of doing things
1717015 if ruan and frans are the next best fly halves they will have to prove it playing for their provinces
1717016 the coach and i had a one on one discussion and we decided that it would be better for me in the long term to play at fly half that was our decision and well see how it goes
1717017 i dont want anyone in this squad to one day point a finger at us and say he had failed because he had been forced to play in a certain position
1717018 we will make proposals on the basis of their strong and weak points if they then still feel they would play in a different position it is their right to do so

1717023 i dont understand why after two years you only could make your decision on democrats
1717024 if there was chicanery by all of the caucuses the voters have the right to know that before the election it appears to the average voter that the only misdeeds alleged are against the democrats i think the attorney general should make a decision on the other side of the aisle as well
1717025 the attorney general has indicated he expects that more charges will be filed when the grand jury has completed its investigation however it is inappropriate to put a timeline on an investigation of this magnitude and importance

1717064 i know this is a very sensitive project to many landholders but i would call upon those affected to acknowledge the project will go ahead and that they should openly work with the proponent and i have set down conditions through the environmental management plan
1717065 obviously there is no water therefore why are we having all our taxes spent on a pipeline 70km over the great divide to melbourne which will carry no water
1717066 we will not stop fighting this project because environmentally it is so very wrong
1717067 farmers although they often get bagged are the best environmentalists they look after their properties and their land because that is their living and their income

1717084 its important to recall this is a case not just about one mexican national on death row in texas
1717085 its also about ordinary americans who count on the protection of the consulate when they travel abroad to strange lands its about the reputation of the united states as a nation that adheres to the rule of law

1717094 most texans however consider death a just penalty in certain rare circumstances many europeans disagree so be it
1717095 i think the philosophy is should everybody in our economic system out of a sense of fairness and out of a sense of equity make exactly the same compensation well i dont think so thats just crazy that means that youre going to have shortages all over the place
1717096 you have students in college now that say i am going to shift my goals towards math and science and you could have an unintended consequence of actually creating a shortage in another area

1717385 i flat out loved the story of edgar sawtelle dog lovers in particular will be riveted by this story because the canine world has never been explored with such imagination or emotional resonance yet in the end this isnt a novel about dogs or heartland america although it is a deeply american work of literature its a novel about the human heart and the mysteries that live there understood but impossible to articulate yet in the person of edgar sawtelle a mute boy who takes three of his dogs on a brave and dangerous odyssey wroblewski does articulate them and splendidly i closed the book with that regret readers feel only after experiencing the best stories its over you think and i wont read another one this good for a long long time in truth there has never been a book quite like the story of edgar sawtelle i thought of hamlet when i was reading it of course and in this version ophelia turns out to be a dog named almondine and watership down and the night of the hunter and the life of pi but halfway through i put all comparisons aside and let it just be itself im pretty sure this book is going to be a bestseller but unlike some it deserves to be its also going to be the subject of a great many reading groups and when the members take up edgar i think they will be apt to stick to the book and forget the neighborhood gossip wonderful mysterious long and satisfying readers who pick up this novel are going to enter a richer world i envy them the trip i dont reread many books because life is too short i will be rereading this one

1717390 the arroyo administration cannot continue to ignore demands for the scrapping of vat on oil consumers including students are receiving the hardest blows from weekly oil price hikes the governments reasons for not scrapping vat on oil are hollow compared to the reasons why students have opted to walk out of their classes today in protest against crippling oil prices

1717427 spring is finally here spring when a young mans fancy turns to thoughts of love and eliot spitzer turns to the yellow pages also the fifth anniversary of the iraq war how romantic once again they forgot to greet us with flowers traditionally this is the wood anniversary five which is fitting cause thats what dick cheney gets when he thinks of war the war is going into its sixth year with no end in sight the economy of course is tanking but what is america freaking out about right now that apparently barack obama went to a church and heard his pastor criticize america and just sat there everybody knows when you hear something your pastor says that you dont agree with you get up there and you punch him in the f face and you beat him with the cross not only that this reverend wright apparently he officiated when obama got married wait til they find out the wedding band was the wu tang clan the thing is republicans of course dont allow dangerous religious freaks to advise their campaigns they nominate them of course obama had to answer this did you watch his speech he hit all the notes he said racism is real for black people he said white resentment is real for white people but at the end of the day why cant we all come together with the shared knowledge that asians cant drive the good news is on youtube the obama speech now is getting watched more than the clips of the pastor the bad news is that its still far behind the footage of spitzers hooker on girls gone wild this chick is everywhere i swear to god she won american idol the last person to get this famous for f some idiot was kevin federline new yorks new governor david paterson he made history this week hes black hes blind and hes hornier than the last guy he hadnt taken his hand off the bible when they swore him in before he admitted to having multiple affairs see this is what women dont get about the male sex drive he was blind and he still wanted to see other people and its not easy having an affair when youre blind he used to come home with lipstick on his shoes his wife was cheating too did you know that i would have loved to see that confrontation honey i may be blind but im not blind and now the new york post says that eliot spitzer is in therapy for sex addiction im not sure he really understands the process today he requested an analyst with really big tits

1717429 a new cnn poll just came out about the campaign interesting results a new study shows that wine drinkers prefer hillary clinton to the other candidates yeah after hearing this bill clinton asked how much wine have they had i guess this is good news former new york governor eliot spitzer has reportedly entered therapy for a sex addiction spitzer said his therapy is going well and that his therapist has a fantastic rack in new jersey today there were dangerous winds with gusts up to 50 miles an hour the winds were so strong that they blew former governor mcgreevey off his chauffeur well of course this sunday is easter of course easter is that very very holy day when christians around the world honor a 2 000 year old jewish man who is not larry king a big insurance company just announced they will give 10 million to anyone who can invent a car that gets 100 miles per gallon meanwhile exxon says theyll give 11 million to anyone who kills that guy
1717430 when people in this worn looking city near pittsburgh lament how the sagging economy is slowly crushing them some are also quick to add how much hillary clinton could help them
1717431 with that in mind i believe that the best candidate for philadelphia is the one who has not only ideas but the skills to implement them is willing to embrace change while also working in collaboration with us at the local level is experienced and willing to extend a helping hand and possesses both good judgment and a profound sense of social justice based on those criteria ive made my decision on which candidate i support i have endorsed senator hillary clinton hillary clinton has an impressive 35 year record of fighting on behalf of working families and children fighting for universal health care for every american and has a comprehensive plan to end the war in iraq and restore our standing around the world but most importantly she has a strong commitment to revitalizing our urban centers and i believe that under her leadership our american cities will rise again the hillary clinton agenda for revitalizing philadelphia and other major metropolitan areas is called leave no city behind and it creates a vital partnership between our efforts here in philadelphia and the efforts of the federal government
1717432 pledging to work her heart out if elected president democratic candidate u
1717433 we need to send someone who can be commander in chief and president

1717654 dont worry the government will take care of you with no strings attached
1717655 they dont want them to be mimicked they want to have special achievements in their version so thats one thing theyre pushing on that and theyre saying that if youre developing something on ps3 we want you to have exclusives for us
1717656 im sure there will probably be some that overlap just because there are some fun achievements that you want to do on both but yeah its a different system too theres like gold silver platinum type trophies too so theres going to be top level achievements i guess you have that on xbox too with 60 point ones as opposed to 20 point ones yeah therell definitely be different achievements for both
1717657 graphically in itself its a very very powerful machine i think the problem is you have to teach programmers how to do that we have very very amazing programmers on our xbox team who when they get the ps3 in front of them it takes them forever because of the multi threading they do with the cell processor
1717658 its just how complex the cell processor is as people get their heads around that it gets better and you get more parity coming out but code has to be written in a certain way for that and its a lot more complicated than it is for the xbox
1717659 i think youre seeing development teams now ramp up you get people who are dedicated to the ps3 and thats why youre getting equal graphics you see some stuff on the ps3 like metal gear solid that push it very very firmly graphically and im sure resistance 2 is going to do that as well i think youre going to see games that are developed for each console specifically the exclusives really push it that way still i think the xbox even though it doesnt have as much hard drive space is not blu ray you still see that its a very very powerful machine
1717660 i think thats why games like final fantasy are coming over to the xbox its still in essence as powerful and people have their heads around that maybe two three years from now when theyre very much into the playstation cycle you may see better games come out we dont know i dont think anyones really taken the cell processor to its full potential yet
1717661 part of the skill of developing for the playstation 3 is getting the gpu to farm jobs out to the six spus seeing which spus are idling and can take up some of the slack in a frame to frame kind of way thats why we think were probably only using 30 or 40 per cent of the power of the ps3 right now and theres this great untapped potential all third party developers can get the edge libraries for free and are going to be able to use them in their own ways to get more and more and more out of the ps3 over the years

1717663 mr asbahi has informed the campaign that he no longer wishes to serve in his volunteer position and we are in the process of searching for a new national arab american and muslim american outreach coordinator
1717664 the intent of this ordinance is to try to smear protesters and make them look as if they are somehow criminal or somehow going to engage in some kind of gross conduct
1717665 our intent for this bill is not about suppressing or chilling first amendment rights
1717666 id say the main thing is that we re establish that process that work ethic that nobody takes anything for granted
1717667 and we try to be the hardest working team in america

1717694 the new law adopted by the united nations proposal represents grounds for a radical solution to the constitutional problem of kirkuk in iraq i think that most importantly for kurds is bringing back article 140 to the constitution and stopping the intentions of those who sought to overthrow this article
1717695 the return of this article in accordance with the new electoral law proposed by the united nations is a victory for democracy and constitution in iraq and not a victory for the kurds it is a defeat for malevolent parties opposed to a democratic iraq
1717696 this waiver is not a defeat at all but is proof that the kurds believe in and respect the rights of others this concession is a good reassurance to all parties worried about the joining of kirkuk to the kurdistan region
1717697 and agreed to give written guarantees for the arabs and turkmen included in the electoral law to be voted on at todays meeting

1717713 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves we should not be paying for iraqi projects while iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank
1717714 yes there are problems but that does not mean those problems are going to continue
1717715 in all developing countries you put objectives and sometimes you dont reach them
1717716 they are determined to spend this money on development they see it as a priority
1717717 there may have been people who said this is going to be harder than you think this is going to take a long time but nobody said what we should do is collect a lot of money and let it sit there
1717718 i think some people would contend that because we have continued to make a sizable investment there hasnt been a proper incentive until now for the iraqi government to make its own investment
1717719 i admit that there is some delay in spending the money on the projects in the provinces and in the ministries
1717720 we have problems in this issue because there are lots of obstacles we face because of the situation that were going through were trying to deal with that were trying to improve things but you know the situation in iraq
1717721 in a much stronger position to ultimately shoulder the full burden of its development reconstruction and security programs

1717755 the main reason why banks havent moved before this point is to put it bluntly because of the extraordinary political pressure exerted on banks by the previous government and in particular by the previous treasurer peter costello during the lead up to the last election campaign

1717757 if it is widely believed that those responsible for economic policy are unwilling to take firm action in response to an acceleration in inflation or that they will be unable to sustain that action in the face of an adverse public reaction to slowing economic growth and rising unemployment or that they will postpone a response because of an imminent election then people will expect inflation to accelerate and hence will seek to take action to protect themselves against it actions which will make a further rise in inflation more likely

1717775 there have always been more militant aspects of the clubs leadership in the past but they have been smothered for the benefit of the short term the continuation of the path the club has now embarked on will dictate its ability to succeed

1717777 at some clubs the leadership groups are so strong they influence whether a coach goes or stays we dont want that i believe their business is to play not to be judge jury and executioner our leadership group is not a mini police force within the club and never will be they are there to assist the player group not to penalise their team mates

1717802 we are extremely pleased to be working closely with tianwei on this critical step in their expansion they recognize the need to automate key manufacturing steps to increase their production spire has more than eighty assemblers in the field or under contract using todays high efficiency cells this represents nearly a gigawatt of production capacity our system is a workhorse in the industry

1717828 we have great anticipation for that young man the game seems to come really easy to him we have a gap to fill so hell get a lot of reps
1717829 i would much rather come into a new situation where we have experience on the offensive front and experience on the defensive front and have young inexperience at the skill positions because we know the offensive line and the defensive line really control the game

1717834 its a really fun place to race i would have to say that this is probably the most challenging racetrack we go to because of the speed that you have to carry through some pretty tight corners the backstretch is long and you can really get into the gas though there but then you have to be careful as you head into the inner loop staying on the track and conserving brakes are probably the two most important factors at the glen
1717835 im glad we only race on a road course twice a year road courses are extremely challenging on both the driver and the team its definitely a challenge i enjoy but it takes a much different approach to driving and setting up the car to be successful on a road course
1717836 we prepare our cars each week to do one specific thing turn left and now we have to setup the car in a completely different way we have to drive the car in a completely different way i think its exciting for the fans and they really enjoy it and i know most of the drivers enjoy it we just go out try to have fun and of course we do our best to win
1717837 we tested at vir virginia international raceway last week and worked on the car to find a good balance rodney childers team director and i worked on our setup for this week and tried a lot of new things as with almost any road course the real preparation begins when we arrive at the racetrack on friday we test what we can on similar style road courses but there is nothing like getting on the actual racetrack and working on the car i try to push my dodge to the limit in each and every area of a road course once i figure out how far i can push it thats when start to put together a strategy to drive the car with every lap in practice you find out just what you can and cant do with your car

1717953 lihatlah seluruh tubuhku penuh dengan luka air mata sudah mengering aku bahkan sudah tak bisa menangis lagi mereka dengan kejamnya mengatakan semua itu mereka merendahkanku huh aku hanya seorang gadis dingin yang tak pernah bersikap romantis bagi mereka aku hanya sebuah alat sebuah mainan untuk mencapai maksud mereka aku mungkin masih dapat menerima kenyataan ini kalau bukan karena ayahku yang playboy itu membawa seorang istri simpanan lagi yang bertujuan untuk menguasai harta peninggalan mama sekarang ini aku bukan lagi sebuah bejana retak aku sudah hancur hatiku sudah menjadi serpihan kecil yang sulit direkat kembali
1717954 jangan menatapku dengan mata penuh rasa kasihan kuberitahu yach aku dari pertama sudah merencanakan untuk mendekatimu dan kemudian menghancurkanmu juga kamu hanyalah sebuah alat pelampiasan sebuah bidak catur yang sudah kupersiapkan aku tak butuh rasa kasihanmu itu aku sudah muak
1717955 cukup sudah jangan menyakiti diri sendiri lagi kamu begitu mungil begitu lembut tega teganya mereka berbuat begitu mereka yang tak pantas untukmu aku tahu aku tidak boleh berpikir begitu tapi aku bersyukur kepada tuhan yang sudah mempertemukan kita dalam keadaan seperti ini kalau bukan karena kehendak nya kita tidak akan berjumpa dan aku pasti sudah melewati hidupku dengan hambar tuhan selalu memperhatikan kita
1717956 memangnya kamu kira kamu siapa bersyukur kalau benar tuhan selalu memperhatikan kita mengapa aku harus diberi cobaan seperti ini keluarga yang berantakan dan laki laki yang hanya mengejar keuntungan dariku
1717957 aku takkan melepaskanmu aku mencintaimu tak mungkin aku melepaskanmu begitu saja
1717958 oh ya sebaliknya aku sama sekali tidak mencintaimu aku tidak butuh cinta dan perhatian dari pria kukira kamu berbeda tapi sama saja bersyukur atas hal yang menimpaku heh dengar jangan dekati aku lagi atau aku takkan memaafkanmu
1717959 adrian dia kurang baik kondisinya sekarang dia berada di rsj
1717960 kalau bukan karena kamu dia takkan berada di sana kamu tahu apa yang sudah kamu lakukan kamu sudah merusak hidupnya kasihan dia sejak kecil dia adalah anak yang sama sekali tidak diharapkan dia bahkan tak pernah merasakan cinta kasih yang seharusnya dia nikmati
1717961 dia anak yang tegar tak sekali pun mengeluh tentang perlakuan orang tuanya orang tuanya sama sekali tidak pernah berharap untuk punya seorang anak bahkan ketika dia meraih prestasi yang baik pada usia yang masih sangat kecil orang tuanya sibuk meniti karir bepergian ke sana ke mari untuk menumpuk kekayaan yang semakin lama semakin banyak adrian hanya dilimpahi uang yang banyak dan ketika dia beranjak dewasa gadis gadis mulai mengerubungi pertamanya dia mengira gadis gadis itu suka padanya karena kepribadiannya dan dia pun mulai menjalin kasih dia sangat menyayangi gadis itu semua yang diinginkan dia berikan sampai akhirnya dia tak sengaja mendengar percakapan kekasihnya dengan orang lain ternyata dia mendekati adrian hanya karena uang gadis itu begitu materialistis adrian menerimanya dengan lapang dada dilepasnya rantai yang membelenggu antara dia dan gadis itu
1717962 adrian begitu polos dikiranya setiap gadis berbeda jadi begitu dia masuk kuliah dia berpacaran lagi ternyata gadis itu tak beda dengan mantan kekasihnya hanya menuntut uang adrian hatinya yang lugu sekali lagi dikecewakan bukan hanya itu hari hari berikutnya di kampus dia lalui dengan penuh sengsara seluruh mahasiswa kampus menertawakannya mempermainkan perasaannya kabar tentang gadis gadis materialistisnya menyebar ke seluruh kampus dia bahkan hampir tak berani nongol di kampus lagi selama berbulan bulan hal ini terus berlanjut sampai akhirnya dia ketemu kamu katanya dia tak ingin lagi dikecewakan ia tahu kamu pernah melewati hari hari yang buruk sepertinya dia ingin sekali menyembuhkan lukamu dia berkata begitu dengan binar binar cinta di matanya dia benar benar mencintaimu tapi mengapa mengapa harus kau lukai lagi perasaan dia dia begitu frustasi selama setengah tahun ini dia mengoceh seorang diri dia mengurung dirinya di rumah tak makan dan tak tidur dia hanya mengingatmu tiga bulan bersamamu adalah hari hari yang paling berbahagia baginya dia bahkan sudah merencanakan acara pada hari ulang tahunmu secara rahasia tapi sepertinya sudah tidak perlu lagi sekarang dia sudah terkapar dalam keadaan yang menyedihkan di rsj tekanan batin yang selama ini terpendam dari dasar hatinya membuatnya menjadi kacau yang lebih ironis lagi orang tuanya baru sadar akan perlakuan mereka setelah semua ini terjadi manusia selalu begitu kehilangan baru tahu menyesalinya
1717963 maafkan aku drie aku minta maaf aku tak mengira semua perbuatanku akan berbuah seperti ini kalau saja waktu bisa berputar balik aku tak akan menolakmu aku tak akan berkata sekejam itu padamu mengapa waktu itu aku tidak mengutarakan isi hatiku padamu aku memang pengecut aku tak berani mengakui aku sudah jatuh cinta padamu aku benar benar bodoh hanya demi sebuah harga diri yang tak bernilai itu aku menghancurkan semuanya kebahagiaan kita aku aku sudah membunuh semua kebahagiaan kita dengan tangan ini kalau saja waktu itu aku jujur maafkan aku sebenarnya aku mencintaimu aku sudah mencintaimu sejak pertama kali kita bertemu untuk mengakui cinta ini aku membutuhkan waktu yang begitu lama aku begitu takut dikecewakan lagi aku tak ingin luka yang menderaku semakin menganga begitu sakit drie sadarlah aku berjanji akan berada di sampingmu selalu menemanimu dikala suka dan duka dan aku tak akan melarikan diri lagi
1717964 jangan khawatir aku akan menemanimu sampai kamu sadar sampai kamu kembali pada dunia nyata dan ketika kamu sudah sadar kamu akan mendapatiku d sampingmu menjagamu dan mencintaimu selalu kamu tak akan sendirian saja akan selalu ada aku dan meskipun kamu tak pernah sadar aku tidak akan meninggalkanmu kamu adalah segalanya bagiku baik sekarang maupun nanti di masa depan aku tak akan pergi sampai kamu sendiri yang memintaku
1717965 masih ingat ketika kita sama sama ke taman hiburan aku sangat menyukai crepe di sana dan kamu membelinya banyak sekali khusus untukku terus kamu suka sekali mengagetkanku di rumah hantu walaupun kamu sudah tahu aku takut hantu kamu bandel sekali waktu itu cepatlah sadar aku ingin kamu membawaku ke sana lagi kita akan bermain bersama lagi
1717966 aku masih ingat kamu bilang kamu paling suka suasana di tepi pantai kamu bilang romantis sekali apalagi ketika sunset waktu itu aku menertawakanmu soalnya kamu romantis sekali sich melukiskan pemandangan pantai padaku aku sebenarnya terharu sekali lho aku sama sekali tidak menyangka kamu bisa menyukai hal yang sama denganku pasir putih yang berkilauan ditimpa sinar mentari senja deburan ombak yang mendebarkan samar samar terdengar suara kepakan sayap burung camar nyiur melambai lambai diayunkan oleh semilir angin memberikan suasana damai yang menenangkan ini kalimat yang kamu ucapkan begitu romantis bagaikan menyajak kamu mampu mendeskripsikan semuanya dengan indah sekali pilihan kata kata yang tepat benar benar membuatku terlena
1717967 drie kamu ingat kejadian lucu di perpustakaan waktu itu kita suka sekali berdebat tentang segala hal yang dapat diperdebatkan kadang kadang kita bahkan menghabiskan waktu berjam jam hanya untuk memperdebatkan satu hal misalnya bagaimana perumusan teori mendel tentang genetika dalam prakteknya atau bagaimana cara menolong anak anak fakir miskin dan yatim piatu suatu hari gara gara kita terlalu asyiknya membahas kekuasaan julius caesar kita jadi terkurung di dalam perpustakaan semalaman sebenarnya waktu itu aku sempat deg deg an juga tapi kamu emang gentleman kamu sih milih tempatnya di pojok pojok sampai sampai petugasnya kira sudah tak ada orang lagi
1717968 bukan ini aku adrian jiwaku selalu mencari jalan untuk keluar dari tekanan ini dan kamu suaramu yang lembut mampu mencapai dasar hatiku yang paling dalam butuh waktu bagiku untuk menyadari segalanya aku minta maaf sudah merepotkanmu
1717969 tuhan betapa aku mendambakan saat saat seperti ini kamu kembali padaku kamu benar benar sudah kembali padaku kamu tak perlu meminta maaf aku yang seharusnya minta maaf ini semua salahku kalau bukan paul yang menceritakan semuanya padaku aku tak akan berada di sini aku aku bahkan sudah memutuskan untuk menjadi seorang biarawati tidak perduli lagi terhadap kisah cinta antara dua orang yang berlainan jenis tapi ternyata tuhan sama sekali tidak menghendakiku dia mempertemukan aku dengan paul
1717970 shh aku sudah tahu semuanya setiap kata yang kamu ucapkan sudah tertanam erat dalam hatiku suaramu lah yang menyelamatkan aku menuntunku untuk kembali mengembalikan semua keinginan yang sudah terkubur aku mencintaimu
1717971 this is a very effective way to promote diversity of voices and increase competition in the telecommunications industry i support diversity in media ownership because it provides a window into communities languages views and values that might not otherwise be heard without these outlets
1717972 unfortunately we see major news outlets airing too many sensationalist stories on outlandish topics such as immigrants with leprosy black street gangs or mexican plots to re conquer the united states americans should be able to flip to stations where we can hear about asian american ceos revolutionizing their industries african american doctors saving lives and hispanic soldiers many of whom are not yet citizens bravely fighting overseas under the flag of the country theyre proud to call their own
1717973 when we talk about minority run outlets were not just talking about broadcasters were talking about advocates advocates our communities depend on
1717974 the law is not preventing racial profiling or giving departments a way to track it and hold people accountable for it
1717975 we want them to see to it that law agencies collect racial data its good for the agencies and its good for the public
1717976 in every town city and parish examined people of color were arrested at a higher rate than their representation in the population
1717977 in bunkie black people are 3 8 times as likely to get arrested as white people
1717978 there are two types of arrests discretionary and nondiscretionary where the officer has no say about arresting the person
1717979 if you lump those two together it will skew the statistics but does it show racial profiling i suggest it does not
1717980 if the democrats are to have any chance at all of carrying this state it will only be because of a much larger than normal and completely united black vote
1717981 we challenged that because it could have a ripple effect across north carolina
1717982 some of the outside groups that will come in and register voters are not familiar with north carolina law
1717983 they dont have a lot of oversight from the democratic party
1717984 were going to be vigilant through the election cycle that all the rules are followed
1717985 almost every one of those provisions that have been sponsored at the state and national level have been sponsored by republicans and almost uniformly opposed by democrats
1717986 their tactics if theyre not properly punished will be repeated
1717987 the other side is going to throw everything they can to stop him
1717988 many people participated in the may primary and will not be susceptible to the smokescreens

1718040 koehler resolved to make something big out of channel 6
1718041 at the time the typical half hour television news program local and national consisted of eight to 10 stories with the anchor and reporters spending a lot of that time talking about what had happened that day
1718042 the brainstorming came up with two propositions 1 more and shorter stories an increase from about 10 to 20 or more and 2 more pictures and less talk
1718043 magid had been a college professor of social science who was building a consulting firm specializing in the communications industry
1718044 it is important to understand that while many stations management gives lip service to wanting to change and do things that are new when push comes to shove they dont change because they fear what is new they arent willing to take the chances george was willing to take
1718045 magid and his team tested various formats on philadelphia audiences
1718046 what magid and koehler found out was that television viewers in the philadelphia region wanted more news but less detail
1718047 sometime later koehler composed an eight page single spaced treatise titled how you do the news in which he outlined and then elaborated upon the basic principles of the action news format as it was first developed and as it still remains in effect

1718084 and that ye will save alive my father and my mother and my brethren and my sisters and all that they have and deliver our lives from death
1718085 and the lord said unto gideon by the three hundred men that lapped will i save you and deliver the midianites into thine hand and let all the other people go every man unto his place
1718086 and the children of israel said to samuel cease not to cry unto the lord our god for us that he will save us out of the hand of the philistines
1718087 and when the children of israel cried unto the lord the lord raised up a deliverer to the children of israel who delivered them even othniel the son of kenaz calebs younger brother
1718088 the god of my rock in him will i trust he is my shield and the horn of my salvation my high tower and my refuge my saviour thou savest me from violence
1718089 they forgat god their saviour which had done great things in egypt
1718090 and it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the lord of hosts in the land of egypt for they shall cry unto the lord because of the oppressors and he shall send them a saviour and a great one and he shall deliver them

1718092 i even i am the lord and beside me there is no saviour
1718093 tell ye and bring them near yea let them take counsel together who hath declared this from ancient time who hath told it from that time have not i the lord and there is no god else beside me a just god and a saviour there is none beside me

1718096 for unto you is born this day in the city of david a saviour which is christ the lord
1718097 and said unto the woman now we believe not because of thy saying for we have heard him ourselves and know that this is indeed the christ the saviour of the world
1718098 him hath god exalted with his right hand to be a prince and a saviour for to give repentance to israel and forgiveness of sins
1718099 of this mans seed hath god according to his promise raised unto israel a saviour jesus
1718100 for our conversation is in heaven from whence also we look for the saviour the lord jesus christ
1718101 paul an apostle of jesus christ by the commandment of god our saviour and lord jesus christ which is our hope

1718129 theres a lot you dont understand until you try it on yourself and if you let the fear of failure stop you from trying something new youll face nothing but stagnation
1718130 one mistake doesnt mean that the next attempt is more likely to fail
1718131 actually it should be the contrary it should be more likely to succeed as that person hopefully learned something from the mistakes

1718202 iran already stopped nuclear enrichment at the behest of europe for more than a year a reference to tehrans suspension of enrichment between late 2003 and mid 2005 to allow negotiations with the european union and what happened nothing

1718204 the americans when they need the npt they talk about it when they dont need it they throw it away you dont do that with an international treaty
1718205 no evidence that iran was working actively to build nuclear weapons

1718806 at a time of economic decline and record high gas prices there is something refreshing in an oilman turning into one of the nations leading advocates of renewable energy this could explain why t boone pickens multibillion dollar efforts to reduce americas oil dependence and develop clean energy have garnered so muchpublic attention pickens is right to suggest that americas oil dependence is a source of economic ruin and that congress must act to stop the biggest transfer of wealth in human history but pickens stands to benefit from his own campaign and his proposal could do more damage than good to u s energy security pickens proposal involves a california ballot initiative to provide 5 billion in subsidies for developing clean energy fuels on top of a 58 million public relations campaign to reduce americas oil dependence through wind power not coincidentally the texas oilman is heavily invested in natural gas and wind power the pickens plan promises to dramatically reduce oil use by shifting the transportation sector from gasoline powered cars and trucks to natural gas powered vehicles this would allegedly reduce oil imports by more than 30 and would supposedly save the u s economy 300 billion that otherwise would end up in the coffers of oil rich foreign countries according to the plan wind energy would substitute for natural gas now generating 20 of the nations electricity freeing natural gas to power a third of the vehicles in the u s there is nothing wrong with wind power on the contrary it is one of the cheapest ways to generate renewable power but since only 2 of u s electricity is generated from oil wind power as well as nuclear power solar energy and other renewable power sources often touted by politicians and pundits would do nothing to reduce u s oil dependence unless we start using electricity to power our vehicles pickens assertion that increased use of wind power would displace natural gas is based on wishful thinking our energy system is not a lego game one piece cant replace another at whim even if 78 other billionaires were willing to follow pickens footsteps and build a 4 000 megawatt wind farm thats the number needed to displace the current electricity production from natural gas theres no way to guarantee that natural gas would be the only energy source that would be displaced by all those turbines why not coal or solar furthermore implementation of the pickens plan might actually tie more natural gas to the power sector wind is an intermittent source of power the wind doesnt blow 24 hours a day seven days a week and until and unless our electricity grid has sufficient power storage capacity utilities counting on wind need to have backup power plants that can be powered up to fill in the gaps when the wind does not blow this back up power is today generally provided with natural gas

1718828 one rather simple way of getting into your paper is to take the side of the argument that most of the citizens will want to avoid they are intellectual exercises and it is legitimate to argue now one way and now another as debaters do in similar circumstances always take the that looks to you hardest least defensible it will almost always turn out to be easier to write interestingly on that side

1718942 the only energy plan obama has is inflated tires and that wont work as well as our oil drilling idea
1718943 obama didnt visit wounded troops but did make time to go to the gym
1718944 the oil companies have thousands of acres to already drill on why do they need more

1718954 i really dont understand how it could ever be this close
1718955 omg they are ratcheting up the propaganda to try to blame iraq for 9 11 so they can invade it
1718956 but the trip quickly became fodder for an aggressive mccain campaign strategy that included a tv ad comparing the celebrity status of barack obama to that of brittney spears and paris hilton
1718957 considering the amount of unanswered questions regarding 9 11 and all the indications that it was a covert false flag operation it isnt hard to imagine such an event being played out in the cyber world
1718958 the facts are there and they tell a story of government incompetence not government malice
1718959 they can keep area 51 a secret thousands of employees d
1718960 can some of you oh so intelligent truthers explain to me how the government will plan a false flag attack that will cripple millions of internet users with some horrible virus
1718961 please explain how the government will enforce said i patriot act
1718962 the same way they enforce copyright laws buy the cooperation of isp
1718963 not necessary make up terrorist cell say you saved america by invading their online privacy everybody bends over like they did for the patriot act and fisa dont even need the terrorist act just say you foiled the attempt
1718964 and simply closing large parts of the infrastructure would suffice
1718965 i have news for you the government does monitor cell phone networks and they probably do keep tabs on certain peoples calls
1718966 and you still havent explained how the government will enforce this
1718967 a few dozen people are without internet all the time it happens
1718968 the only major government organization going after isps has been the riaa and a lot of the isps have not been cooperating
1718969 then whats stopping them from doing the same on the internet its the exact same principle but on a different media you just made the argument for me they gained that unconstitutional right just by mentioning the word terrorist
1718970 no you idiot you shut down the internet for half of america blame it on terrorists and make the 12 people that could know about it shut up
1718971 and the patriot act forces corporate compliance theres no reason to believe the i patriot act wouldnt do the same
1718972 hmmm must be something to this wed better control the internet quick before it destroys america
1718973 no one will come after your games and porn but there will be laws in place that allow to track and shut down any one who is deemed cyber terrorist
1718974 the government is evil and they lie and they use false flag attacks
1718975 passing laws to have isps start censoring stuff is unconstitutional
1718976 there is something horribly treasonously wrong with a government by the people for the people that operates by lying to the people
1718977 do you really think countries across the globe are going to let the united states come and arrest people for saying something over the internet
1718978 such an event could come in the form of a major viral attack the hacking of a major citys security or transport systems or some other vital systems or a combination of all of these things considering the amount of unanswered questions regarding 9 11 and all the indications that it was a covert false flag operation it isnt hard to imagine such an event being played out in the cyber world
1718979 furthermore the internet is an international thing not an american thing
1718980 considering the amount of unanswered questions regarding 9 11 and all the indications that it was a covert false flag operation
1718981 theres going to be an i 9 11 event which doesnt necessarily mean an al qaeda attack it means an event where the instability or the insecurity of the internet becomes manifest during a malicious event which then inspires the government into a response
1718982 i came to investigate the american militarys report that violence is falling in baghdad that life in the city is improving that the us surge has transformed the city what i found contradicts all the official reports baghdad is a city where one street is at war with the next where the people are more desparate than ive ever seen them
1718983 you know whats so funny not in a ha ha way is that we created most of the violence there to begin with so this surge should have never had happened
1718984 prove how the american way is killing the spirits of its citizens
1718985 what we still dont understand is why you americans stopped the bombing of hanoi you had us on the ropes if you had pressed us a little harder just for another day or two we were ready to surrender it was the same at the battles of tet you defeated us we knew it and we thought you knew it but we were elated to notice your media was definitely helping us they were causing more disruption in america than we could in the battlefields we were ready to surrender you had won
1718986 it wouldnt reduce our oil consumption 3 or 4 percent it would increase mileage of gasoline powered cars 3 or four percent
1718987 you hate gays non religious people anti war people anyone who doesnt agree with you mccain has just as much experience being potus as obama does
1718988 if oil companies wanted to drill more they would have done it already on the 68 million offshore acres they have leased

1718991 energy efficiency by using improved technology and practicing sensible habits in our homes businesses and automobiles is a big part of the answer and is something we can achieve right now
1718992 is a kind of grand jihad in eliminating and destroying the western civilization from within and sabotaging its miserable house by their hands and the hands of the believers so that it is eliminated and allahs religion is made victorious over all other religions
1718993 tell me what company you keep and ill tell you what you are
1718994 we are a group that supports social justice for our oppressed muslim brothers all over the world we support barack obama for president because he is sympathetic to the plight of muslims he is a man of integrity who will not be bullied by the neo cons and the zionists he will stand up for our oppressed palestinian brothers and sisters whose land is being illegally occupied by the evil zionist entity whose name i just hate to even write

1719001 thou shalt not fail to let the first batter pass
1719002 if they used any of those tactics on me id get up and start throwing them
1719003 i think we should fight fire with fire i think therell be fireworks
1719004 they get three into every tackle its unbelievable they might stop doing it for a week or so but it will come back again near the finals
1719005 its ruck tactics been well documented over the last few weeks
1719006 every teams works hard on the ruck and play the ball area
1719007 im sure the referee will be intent on watching the ruck area theyll be keeping an eye on what tactics go on
1719008 we need to be aggressive and get on the front foot theres no use being a passive team and letting them dictate terms
1719009 we cant let the storm dictate the terms we need to be aggressive in all parts of our game
1719010 a lot of teams do it well be ready for it they do it pretty well
1719011 they will step on your hand my hands been trodden on a hundred times over the years
1719012 if he referees as he should there wont be a problem
1719013 getting in a fight is not going to help you do that
1719014 apparently it was a little bit more complicated than they thought
1719015 the x rays showed just a break but when they got into my hand it was in four pieces
1719016 but they sorted it all out and put plenty of hardware in there
1719017 the doctor seems to think if everything goes well and im very diligent with my rehab i should be back for the second game in south africa
1719018 that gives me something to aim for and ill be busting my backside to get back on the park then
1719019 it is a setback but i just have to work hard now to get back on the field and this is the next challenge
1719020 i was really happy with the way things were progressing positionally as a fullback
1719021 thats what a player enjoys being able to build on each performance staying in the one position
1719022 i thought the hard work was paying off but obviously collectively it was a disappointing performance last weekend
1719023 that was our first loss under robbie and the way he wanted us to handle it was very positive
1719024 robbie wanted it gone as soon as we left the sheds
1719025 he didnt want anyone hung up on the loss sulking about it
1719026 he said keep your heads up and tomorrow is a new day
1719027 we were all very disappointed with the loss because it was fairly significant one against those guys
1719028 it is frustrating because i really cant train for the next week or so properly
1719029 it more plays on your head that you feel guilty you are not doing anything and falling behind
1719030 but john mccain would never have to live with the realities of his own radical health plan which would raise costs by dismantling the employer based coverage system that insures 60 percent of us putting us in the same position as the sheltons with a medicine cabinet full of prescriptions we need to keep us healthy that could also get us denied health care coverage because theyre instrumental in helping the insurance health industry
1719031 hello you must see it lol my friend catched you on hidden cam
1719032 i rock up to training and folkesy steve folkes someone that to be honest has never paid any interest in my personal life he comes up to me and starts saying youre not turning muslim are you
1719033 i start to think who is he to question my friends
1719034 if you asked hazem el masri about how i perceive muslims youll find ive often asked him questions about the religion because i dont fully understand it
1719035 if something comes up that i heard i ask him
1719036 its certainly not right of him to say that we took no interest in his home life or personal life
1719037 i supported him through the clovelly hotel thing when he was caught allegedly having sex in the toilets with ironwoman candice falzon his drink driving thing through his urinating in public thing
1719038 we stood up for him and did our best to try and get him through that so i think it is a pretty naive statement to make
1719039 in light of what has happened my advice about him not putting too much credence into what anthony mundine says was probably good advice
1719040 who is he to come and question my friends and their values and their religion
1719041 who does he think he is does he think he is god is he god or something
1719042 yeah whatever comes out of his mouth is that right
1719043 when i did join up with khoder and asked khoder to manage me
1719044 obviously to do something like that leave i wasnt happy
1719045 i havent been happy at the dogs for a while
1719046 nothing to do with the players i love my close mates but a whole range of things
1719047 it wasnt that long ago that he signed a five year deal so i assumed to commit to somewhere for five years he was happy to commit to that
1719048 i know sonny has been going around crying poormouth about only earning 500 000 a year cant survive on that
1719049 i dont know if it is just this generation whether it is young footballers or generation y in general but they expect everything and dont want to cough up for it
1719050 they expect that everything is going to be given to them on a platter and the fact he cant survive on 500 000 a year is a bit sad really
1719051 he will do anything now to try and justify this decision regardless
1719052 i was in the room last year when he agreed shook hands and signed a deal to stay with us five years
1719053 so regardless of what he says now its all p in the wind really
1719054 shes not hiding anything sir it went down like i said
1719055 i still need her statement theres blood in the water and the sharks are circling the wagons
1719056 i had an aunt with pyromania shed knit sweaters then set them on fire
1719057 jack ran out to the suburbs to check on her
1719058 i will bring your partner before a disciplinary committee if i dont know hear from her within the hour so if you have any clue where she might be sergeant i suggest you find her
1719059 i dont care if she saved the mayors daughter from being eaten by sharks
1719060 i want her debriefed right now do i make myself clear
1719061 good now ive got to talk to the media theyre having a field day with their cockamamie theories
1719062 well done kerrin nice second i backed her to win and she should have
1719063 my wife cathy and i talked at length about coming home and decided the time was right
1719064 we are expecting our first child to be born in november so its good to come home and be closer to our families after a fair stint overseas
1719065 its great that ive been given the opportunity to come back to a quality racing operation like peter snowdens with the backing of the darley horses
1719066 ive ridden in australia before so i know what the racing is like here but yeah ill definitely be getting my eye in again over the next couple of weeks
1719067 dont get me wrong they race tight and very competitively in europe but its nothing like here
1719068 its a very different style of racing in europe so its hard to compare the horses until i really get to know them
1719069 but as i ride in trackwork and races over the next few weeks ill be learning more about them
1719070 i also dont know a lot about the majority of tracks up here so it will be a steep learning curve over the coming weeks
1719071 kerrin arrived from europe on friday and rode in trackwork and trials tuesday morning
1719072 hes had five rides here kembla and will be riding at gosford today so its a full on start for him
1719073 weve always had a very high regard for his ability hes a player of real talent we wouldnt be different to any other club in that we would be interested if he was to become available and wanted to come home
1719074 ive got a responsibility to our members and supporters for the good of the essendon football club and what we think could strengthen our list
1719075 well discuss all options at the end of the year and you cant put anything out of the equation
1719076 alan didak thats an interesting one we havent looked at that yet so we will just wait and see at the end of the year
1719077 youd have to say its harder to win when hes in the field than when hes not in the field but i dont see this as any greater opportunity than last years pga
1719078 i grew up on a farm in bourke where my family were mainly into horses so i was more around the cowboy scene
1719079 but once my dad bought me a bike and i had a go competing i was hooked
1719080 lawson put me under some pressure but then he went down in a corner and i fully charged home without any errors to take the win
1719081 this was my last under 19s championship im now stepping up into the pro lites class where im really looking forward to some serious competition
1719082 im excited to see how i will go against riders whom i have admired while working my way up through the ranks
1719083 he has an amazing amount of natural talent he picks up things so quickly and easily when it would take other kids a while to master it

1719131 we have spent the last nine years building an enterprise ready bpms that can compete on the same level as the largest vendors in the industry
1719132 with this release i am happy to say we have arrived and coming off several quarters of year over year growth at over 125 i am confident that this version will continue that success
1719133 intalio bpms is standards based and brings with it a solid architectural foundation required to implement robust process solutions
1719134 the built in support for w3c standards such as xsd xml xpath and others has given us the ability to solve complex problems easily
1719135 if it is really going to make a difference and be done on a significant scale we will need greater flexibility to achieve that
1719136 we should probably not be doing this in the good times when the housing market is buoyant but in a downturn we are very aware of the local economy and are in a position to intervene if the right resources are in place
1719137 that is what local authorities will need to be asking government
1719138 we welcome that as an opportunity to promote sustainability and good mortgage packages that will suit people who are not able to get reasonable mortgage rates elsewhere
1719139 if we are really going to make a difference in a significant scale then we will need greater flexibility to achieve that
1719140 it is not just about paying your own mortgage but being able to manage the quality and standards of the property you are in
1719141 we have already started to do that and the proposals are perfectly reasonable

1719164 these products are to be introduced in coordination with the launch of dr dres long awaited detox album and will be supported by a fully integrated marketing program with the performer and his record company
1719165 im just now over the last couple of months starting to feel that its going to be right and its something i can be proud of and everybody is going to love it
1719166 we had a strong beginning to 2005 because we sacrificed 2004 with the regulation change although towards the end we lifted
1719167 last year we had actually had a better season than the results showed and maybe we were given credit for but i think now we have got a good team of people working together and it is coming
1719168 next year is a huge opportunity and a huge risk if you get it right you will be a star and if you get it wrong you will be struggling all season so we are mindful of that
1719169 like everybody we have been working a long time on the 2009 car we are still forcing this car hard but until we actually race in australia next year i dont think anyone will know how they have done
1719170 to be honest i think it will be another couple of weeks before it is 100 percent on the 2009 car
1719171 but even now we have been putting quite a lot of effort onto the 2009 car
1719172 we have been working on it for i suppose nine months to one year but everybody has we think we are good but someone else may be better we need to be paranoid
1719173 we are trying to be strong everywhere we are trying to put more on the car but are mindful that we have a massive change in terms of the profile of the aerodynamics for next year
1719174 so everyone is reaching that dilemma i think between ourselves renault and red bull it is partly track dependent and the question will be who can put the most on in the last few weeks before we have to start on next years car without stop
1719175 in a way the result in hungary was a very important lesson for the team
1719176 it showed us in no uncertain terms we cannot afford to be complacent and need to work hard throughout the summer break to make sure we can hit back strongly in valencia
1719177 you can never under estimate a team like ferrari and we know theyll be pushing just as hard as us to gain an advantage for the remainder of the year
1719178 who knows if wed had an easier race in hungary maybe it would have come back and bitten us later in the season so i feel confident we wont be taking anything for granted
1719179 i know everybody will be working flat out to make sure we can be strong in all the remaining races
1719180 ive had a look at some onboard footage of the track and will be working with the team over the break to prepare for the event
1719181 from the footage the track looks amazing i love street circuits but this one looks extremely fast and unforgiving in some places
1719182 as a driver its always fun to go to a new circuit i really enjoy driving at new places and feel confident i can pick up new circuits quickly
1719183 honestly i think its difficult because although there are going to be completely new rules next year there could be changes but ive never seen a car thats fighting at the back one year then sweep the field the next
1719184 its always step by step so its hard to close the gap whether its the aerodynamics the engine or the tyres whatever our problems are wed have to work very hard to close that gap

1719408 i know personally mccain for 20 years he is a person of principle and he is also a person who has absolutely a great record of supporting israel getting to obama there is no record nobody can know for sure what will be it can happen to be good it can happen to be very bad its a risk
1719409 crypto jews the flame that the inquisition could not extinguish
1719410 growing numbers of bnai anousim throughout the spanish and portuguese speaking world are looking to reconnect with israel and the jewish people
1719411 one of our goals is to raise awareness among world jewry about this phenomenon by telling the story of the bnai anousim both in the past and the present
1719412 for far too long the jewish people have ignored the bnai anousim and it is time for that to change we need to reach out to them and to welcome them back home
1719413 and you shall inscribe these words upon the doorposts of your house and upon your gates
1719414 the right of lebanon its people its army and the resistance to liberate its land in the shebaa farms kfarshuba hill and ghajar
1719415 the unity and the authority of the state would be the guiding principle of all government decisions and actions
1719416 over all lebanese territories gradually with the states own forces
1719417 disbanding of all lebanese and non lebanese militias the militias weapons shall be delivered to the state of lebanon within a period of 6 months beginning with the approval of the national accord charter
1719418 the dozens of people who came to kfar yam before the expulsion
1719419 did not disperse afterwards but rather remained a cohesive group and even absorbed more people mainly from gush etzion
1719420 that the situation in gaza cant continue as it is with hamas fighting both fatah and israel at some point israel will have to intervene and once a jewish stronghold is established we will follow right behind
1719421 those who yearn for an operation in gaza need not worry it will yet have to come
1719422 the moment that it is possible we will do it without asking anyone
1719423 the idea is to replicate the success we had with homesh one of the four northern shomron towns that were destroyed in the disengagement in homesh we succeeded in popularizing in the public awareness the idea that we will return and now we want to do the same thing with gush katif people should get used to the idea that we will return even if we dont know the exact date
1719424 were not asking anyone if its not possible we wont do it but we plan to do everything we can we want to keep gush katif on the map
1719425 at the very least 80 of those who lived in gush katif want to return to their homes when it becomes possible
1719426 how can we make any progress without holding indirect negotiations between the sides especially when each side is staunchly committed to its position
1719427 where was the idf all these years whenever we complained of rock throwings
1719428 it appears that the idf provides selective protection now it thinks that the arabs are in danger so suddenly it begins beefing up its patrols we have been complaining for years about the dangers to jews and incidents of rock throwings and shootings against jews are many many times more numerous than the other way around yet the army often fails to help us out
1719429 whenever there is a violent incident between jews and arabs the first thing the army does when it arrives is to arrest the jews for instance in the gilad farm a few days ago arabs threw rocks the jews called the police and the next thing we knew jews were arrested
1719430 saying that the police apparently have become confused as to their mission the law says he has 35 days to respond
1719431 we have apparently returned to the days of the british mandate
1719432 when the jews had to contend with a hostile government the government has placed great restrictions on our growth and construction for instance has restricted new connections to the electricity grid frozen zoning plans and has barely done anything to stop the arabs from stealing metal and various infrastructure elements
1719433 i think olmert will try to hammer us as hard as he can its like his last gasp death throes i also think he will try to remove and destroy migron a jewish neighborhood north of jerusalem with 43 families unless the police and army tell him that this is unfeasible
1719434 despite all however am yisrael chai the nation of israel lives
1719435 we are continuing to grow and develop for instance did you know that this coming year we have an increase of 220 children in our nursery schools for a total of almost 1 900 and our population growth is the largest in the country from 23 000 to nearly 25 000 like in pharoahs time the more they try to oppress us the more we thrive

1719507 gerade im silicon valley hat jeder einen indischen arabischen chinesischen oder deutschen akzept da f llt das berhaupt nicht auf

1719554 to become successful in the rapidly evolving semiconductor industry addressing technology issues jointly rather than independently reduces the risk by leveraging the best of both companies
1719555 future joint technology development will be the key success factor in our alliance and we expect to make significant progress in developing memory solutions by focusing on the introduction of new products through systematic co development in product software and controller areas together hynix and numonyx will develop a complete range of products on leading edge technologies that will enable both companies to win in the nand segment well now have one of the broadest nand design communities in the world and we look forward to continued success as we now work to develop new nand memory solutions today and in the future
1719556 success and growth in the nand segment over the next five years will require a unique set of capabilities that we believe we can achieve with hynix
1719557 by combining our expert resources engineering activities and hynixs absolute focus on driving cost we believe well have leading edge technology cost effective and scalable manufacturing industry leading memory system

1719560 but hamelin made it sing the young singers of the norwegian soloists and their director grete pedersen gave a phenomenally idiomatic performance of messiaens rarely tackled 1949
1719561 the first word is it the last word is triumphant i think that pretty much sums it up her
1719562 send myself back with words as catalysts to open the memories out and see what they had to offer
1719563 this book in particular its not all that well planned out actually
1719564 i flew up to prince rupert with no real expectations
1719565 i became attracted to prince rupert because its in a word depressing thatll anger some people who live there but a lot of people who live there would agree with me it rains all the time and its dark and the economy is in the tank when it came time to write i tried not to stereotype anything and i think i caught it pretty accurately the depressed population people going a bit nutty id be interested to hear what people in prince rupert think
1719566 although the french werent as bad as the english in terms of their imperialistic regard for aboriginals champlain is vilified by some pierre berton called him that assassin i believe he killed some iroquois and champlain married a 12 year old when he returned to france when he was in his 40s so obviously the creature i created has nothing to do with the real champlain but it was 400 years ago so i dont feel any responsibility to history or the truth or anything
1719567 when you keep that in mind events begin to repeat in the two narratives for example champlains men are searching for china around the corner of a river going upstream they think they can find china then here we are in modern day prince rupert and theyre still looking for china for chinas trade thats why prince rupert was built to ship canadian goods to china the town is actively courting china theyre still searching
1719568 one of the main contrasts between samuel champlain and andy winslow is how they explore
1719569 it has a slightly apocalyptic feel sure i dont want to have this big western european guilt trip about how weve destroyed the planet but the facts are the facts i cant deny global warming what i think as an author doesnt really matter but there are some interpretations im afraid of for instance i can see someone reading the book and thinking its about well if everythings going to shit lets have a party thats certainly one reading but its a negative take on the book im not making a big statement but what im really trying to get to is that its important to celebrate this sounds corny and i hate that word celebrate but its really important to enjoy the moment and see that you dont need a reason to celebrate i really hate that word though
1719570 all of the major canadian authors have written historical fiction i have no idea why all i can guess is that its really fun and you get to do research what i discovered having done this for the first time is that research gives you wonderful ideas that you wouldnt have come upon yourself for example i was researching out in nova scotia where they had built a reconstruction of champlains lhabitation some of the houses of the nobles had glass windows while others just had oiled parchment so i asked the guy how accurate this was i didnt even know if they had glass back then in any case he replied that they did have glass and it was brought over the sea in barrels of molasses theres no way i would have known that so then i thought how would they clean the molasses off and i invented this scene in which characters lick it off the glass and get in trouble
1719571 obviously there are a number of removes from the actual history to begin with they spoke french and im writing in english and nobody knows what they sounded like really maybe some researchers do it was probably a sort of french shakespearean but i didnt want to go that far to write shakespearean english so i guess i went for a pre jane austen english a sort of translated french i inverted a few subject predicates and put in a few needs musts then i invented some expressions because surely they had expressions someone says for instance well be tits up who knows when that was invented it might have been just 30 years ago but maybe it was around in 1606 because of these removes the historical sections are more a figment of my imagination writing them was a kind of exploring it was really fun and free everyone knows what the modern world is like so its easy to make mistakes depicting it but nobody knows what it was like back then so i could mess around with it thats the joy of writing history
1719572 a fair number of people comment on how the creative writing course has influenced canadian literature how canadian stories get written they see a story and say this looks like a creative writing story but i dont think these people know what its like in creative writing workshops ive gone through the creative writing mfa and ive taught it for a long time to my knowledge this is from iowa to new brunswick to ubc no ones promoting a certain kind of story the creative writing story these courses havent hindered the scene at all some people who read and write a lot dont need them but its useful for others to have a deadline and feedback from their peers its good to be with cohorts going to the bar and talking excitedly about writing
1719573 ive been thinking about a new novel for about a month which might be about darcy island in british columbia which was a leper colony 100 years ago its in the percolating stage ive got some characters in mind and some scenes the working title is
1719574 i was raised a vegetarian in regina in the 1970s
1719575 ten years ago when i first started writing cookbooks you had to explain to someone what a vegan was every time you went out
1719576 the goal of my books has always been to make living a vegan lifestyle easier
1719577 i look at them less as cookbooks and more as lifestyle books
1719578 the sheer act of being vegan is a political act
1719579 eating locally supporting small businesses and choosing a cruelty free lifestyle
1719580 unfortunately people are looking at veganism as a way to lose weight which its not
1719581 i hope people will start to really explore and understand veganism as opposed to looking at it as a way to get into your skinny jeans
1719582 you need to eat quality food to have a quality life if youre eating crap you feel like crap
1719583 people can attempt to live on toast and peanut butter or pasta with tomato sauce but that doesnt mean theyre going to get any healthier
1719584 nutritionally speaking most of us should be eating vegan most of the time
1719585 i think many people get wrapped up in the politics when veganism can just be about enjoying good food the food in my book happens to be vegan but it also happens to be delicious
1719586 a gentle enthusiastic nudge toward better eating i think the basis of food should be very natural and we should eat things that are identifiably from farms not packaging factories
1719587 when i talk about the kind of food that nourishes us best thats food thats grown locally and organically
1719588 im not a poster child for veganism by any means
1719589 im more interested in being a poster child for good eating
1719590 since around the 1960s carnivores have felt guilty for eating meat and have felt as if they have to defend themselves
1719591 people no longer feel that way they want to eat meat responsibly and ethically
1719592 i began to think more deeply about what it is were consuming when we eat meat and why its such an important part of human culture
1719593 its important for carnivores to get closer to their farmers to learn where their meat is coming from how its grown
1719594 this is for your own health and for your own sense of comfort about how the animals are raised if were against factory farming and inhumane treatment of animals then we shouldnt shop for it
1719595 eat less meat i eat vegetarian most days of the week its the only ethical way to eat meat
1719596 the cajun boudin sausage at the texaco gas station in appaloosa louisiana
1719597 i eat less meat now than i did when i began researching the book
1719598 butchering a cow and going hunting were major life lessons i gained a lot more respect for where my food comes from and for the animals that have to die
1719599 the old idea was that eating meat was bad for you that it would raise your cholesterol make you fat give you a heart attack
1719600 that was one reason people started turning toward vegetarianism but that idea is ending
1719601 meat is actually very very good for you you just have to eat good meat eat it less often and control your portion size
1719602 when were afforded the luxury of choosing when and what and how we eat instead of just eating everything we can then those decisions become reflective of who we are
1719603 think about where meat comes from buy meat thats humanely raised from a good source we need to encourage more responsible agricultural practices
1719604 the tastiest meat comes from the happiest animals thats win win
1719605 good meat is more expensive its not affordable for a large section of the population
1719606 the force of a citizens politics that openly debates the right use of power and the reasoned pursuit of justice
1719607 ill take it and sort of look at it and hold it awkwardly in my hands and throw it over my shoulder
1719608 originally the bigfoot started as a school project but i took it so far that it could be considered something i initiated myself i went to school at sheridan college in toronto for illustration originally we were supposed to do this assignment like draw one full page in spot illustration for a preexisting piece of text so people chose i dont know gone with the wind 1984 whatever they wanted they were pretty specific about people not writing their own books and i just sort of ignored it and drew one page and drew another page and eventually had two thirds of the book completed by the time this assignment was supposed to be handed in then it wound up selling to a publisher so i think i did pretty well on the project
1719609 bigfoot is the perfect blank slate for writing a book like this a sort of deeply personal humorous way of writing everyone who writes a book about bigfoot its either horror or depending on how you feel about it very serious or very dodgy research stuff in this case its just talking about bigfoot and bigfoots feelings
1719610 i think i mightve seen that clip from six million dollar man and im pretty sure ive seen harry and the hendersons i believe in the first one some evil organizations pit bigfoot against steve austin and in the second one i dont even know he comes back and they become friends and help each other find their way out of a secret laboratory thats exploding its all very vague in my memory i think bigfoot sacrifices his life for the six million dollar man
1719611 yeah sure but i think of him as so much more too and thats kind of what im trying to get across im not sure if he exists ive been asked that many times and i think i just have to take a really neutral stance in a way i do hope he exists in the same way that i think everyone hopes santa exists the idea is so nice it adds a sort of rich mysterious level to our world at the same time if anybody conclusively found out if he existed or if he didnt exist i think i would be in a lot of trouble as far as making these books
1719612 i suppose a lot of the stories that are in bigfoot are taken from my own life in a very general way
1719613 and i think because bigfoots brain is so small his take on the world can be only very basic but in the same way that makes it a little more universal everyone can associate with these moments of being baffled by the modern world but also still totally in love with it of finding things fascinating turning around realizing everythings kind of magical walking through times square or dundas square here in toronto seeing lit up billboards and animation seeing people with freaky haircuts whatever its amazing how much variety and just how absurd the world really is when you try to look at it with fresh eyes
1719614 i guess its kinda hard to hold anything against him in a legal sense he cant stop sticking his hand in the fire he must know that hes getting burned he has this fascination with the trappings of the modern world that will always keep him coming back but the funny thing is hes doing this to become famous trying to increase his notoriety in the world after all these years of people accepting this very basic sort of picture of him which is this stooped figure loping through the woods and covered in sticks and dirt what he wants is the classic hollywood level of fame and what i dont think he realizes is thats precisely going to be his downfall the more he succeeds at getting what he wants the less famous he will become because if he isnt the shadowy figure in the woods then essentially hes nothing because thats what made him famous his mystery and elusiveness
1719615 theres the one good old day where hes lying on a couch and talking to his therapist bigfoots whole take on the world becoming non violent is that he sees it as a decline like something is being lost in the world its not accepted anymore to solve things with your fists throwing boulders at people and stuff like that he just cant see the point everyones become soft
1719616 ive got e mails and stuff like that and people have sent me videos before of them reading bigfoot one of the great things about the character is that everyone has their own bigfoot voice in their head so for me to listen to somebody else of course theyre reading straight from the book so theyre getting the words right but the way i might read it in my head or read it out loud its just something i sort of refuse to do now there is no particular bigfoot voice it is maybe this sort of clunky deep slow pidgin english but it could essentially be anything its a bit weird for me to hear other people read the voice
1719617 its possible i mean its always fun the way ive been writing these books is it seems like every three years i build up enough of a stockpile of these little stories whether theyre my own or other peoples and ill sit down one day and i realise you know its time hopefully that pattern continues because i do love writing bigfoot and its just like the most natural thing in the world at the same time id like to be careful about not beating the joke to death
1719618 i dont think theres any particular divide because i adopt the character when im writing it
1719619 its kind of like this give and go situation the whole way through the book where maybe if something doesnt quite lend itself to words it will be brought out visually or implied in some way and thats not very calculated at all because when im doing this its sort of stream of consciousness i go from using the pencil to scrawl down a rough form of what you see in the book to drawing out the pictures at the same time and sometimes im going back and forth if i was ambidextrous it would be a lot easier to do
1719620 always i mean who doesnt want to make themselves better in some sort of way and it isnt necessarily learning to speak french or not embarrassing yourself talking about opera or something like that but definitely i need to get a cavity filled in my teeth theres some other teeth issues as well ill stay away from those thats none of the publics damn business
1719621 i guess its because they dont know why theyre doing it i guess looking after your dental health is one thing thats self preservation thinking that you need to learn to speak french and that automatically people will like you more that is a bit weird i think i guess in bigfoots case it is a bit weird cause i dont know if he has a genuine interest in or the slightest care about french culture he hasnt even mastered his first language of english and hes already trying to go on and master french
1719622 as far as accentuating the insanity and the absurdness of it maybe its not this really intentional social criticism but in a way its me realizing how absurd these people are in the first place
1719623 with pirates its never just for the money is it
1719624 we will take the book and film forward into the civic election in a big way
1719625 to force a lot of red pill moments on vancouvers citizens and think about what this thing is really all about
1719626 were pretty confident we can paint gregor robertson and peter ladner as kissing cousins if not twins that leaves really one choice which is to vote for grandma betty if you dont believe in that kind of stuff
1719627 its a corporate scam it is the slickest financial scam ive ever heard of its basically a nigerian banking scam multiplied by a million its very very well done at the local level it is built by developers for real estate development at the national level its built for television marketing the two sides talk together and they sell you this thing thats supposed to be mother theresa and wonderbread all rolled into one its a very slick machine and its got 50 years of saturation advertising backing it up most of us grow up thinking the olympics are an unalloyed thing of good and its very hard to break that conditioning
1719628 theyre getting outsourced thats for sure the jobs and a lot of the money i dont think you should be surprised at all i think it was always a bit of a misrepresentation to suggest all the jobs would stay here in b c or even in canada certainly the money doesnt stay here or in canada
1719629 thats what youre going to get under this kind of liberalized trade regime why wouldnt they under nafta you remember how it was sold though it was one more of those things they used during the plebiscite period and even before that to get people onside it was all going to be about jobs for british columbians it was all going to be about art it was all going to be about the greenest games ever thats typical its not atypical for how they sell a bid
1719630 they have a playbook im sure they hand out to cities we know bid cities study each other the ones in the past that worked and the ones that didnt they know for sure what sort of things resonate with the public and they try to hit all those notes the fact that theyre rarely true notwithstanding they get away with it because in most cities people havent been exposed to the stuff before all the happy rhetoric is rarely accurate
1719631 the people in tromsoe until recently didnt know what was happening in vancouver until they realized there was an opposition their opposition group there was kind of beleaguered and didnt know quite what to believe because the tromsoe organizers are saying look vancouvers the perfect example of how everything goes right and everything is on time and on budget and nary a tree came down and you have to actually sit these people down and say actually none of thats true and so actually the opposition there now has a fighting chance to actually combat the circus
1719632 jack poole david podmore and li ka shing and all the developers they make a bag of money on the games they do really really well
1719633 i dont know if youve followed the millennium athletes village thing but theyre going to make a bag of money
1719634 there should be some serious hard scrutiny on this im not suggesting any badness is happening its just youd think with a project of this nature where vancouvers reputation is sort of on the line and you dont want things going south on this and olympic scandals are far too well known youd want to have this be as clean as you can to have the secrecy surrounding it is just weird
1719635 they default as bid organizations do into a culture of secrecy
1719636 what we realize from the rcmp documents is theyve spent most of the 175 million already and we arent anywhere near 2010 which doesnt even begin to add up what the armys going to spend and what the other police are going to spend
1719637 they came up with a low ball number they thought the public would buy and they ran with it
1719638 then they get squirrelly because they dont want to answer questions because if you ask them that question they surely dont want to have to deal with it
1719639 most of the media want to put a happy face on it its understandable from the corporate perspective that that would be true we saw it from almost all the print media we saw it from most of the radio and tv english cbc was awful just ghastly in terms of olympic boosterism they were probably the worst offender of all i suspect it had a lot to do with their high hopes for being the ones getting the broadcast rights they didnt
1719640 at the time they thought they had a lock on it because theyd run the broadcasting for previous games they have beijing so they just assumed they were going to get it they werent going to bite the hand they hoped would feed them
1719641 they didnt even do the balance thing of 10 good things to one negative thing they just ignored stuff they didnt like we chased them for months trying to get any kind of coverage at all from cbc the fact there even was an opposition it was absurd
1719642 the media goes through different phases before the bid was one phase now everyones being a little more critical because the numbers dont add up and the promises clearly are falling by the wayside
1719643 then theres the third phase when you get closer to the games and you get nothing but glowing reports and theyll all default into the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat kind of stuff
1719644 afterwards who cares its come its gone the moneys spent and the financial hangovers set in and eagleridge is still gone so now what why harp on negative things when you cant do anything about them the circus has moved on they didnt pay any taxes they scooted out of town and it sucks to be us
1719645 the number we came up with is pretty close to what vaughn palmer pegged in 2002 about 6 billion and thats what we know in public money you get about 6 billion if you add the private sector contribution it pushes it closer to 7 billion
1719646 if it was a totally privately financed bid that would be a different thing its not its massively publicly financed the province by signing the host city agreement has basically issued an unsecured line of credit so if it costs 6 billion thats one thing if it costs 20 billion theyre going to pay it youve just given your credit card to the guy on the corner you better hope hes okay
1719647 it gets really murky really quickly you could make your best guesses and make your assumptions and youre going to get a low ball figure at the very best thats what were dealing with no one will ever know what the olympic games cost it goes to transparency in government it goes to accountability of government it goes to in a massive way lost opportunities and priorities
1719648 what kind of society puts its priorities on having a party and making a few people wealthy and leaves how many people homeless in vancouver
1719649 the list is endless what kind of society spends money on a party when it needs to deal with other urgent issues of somewhat more import than how many of our athletes are standing on the podium getting their trinkets
1719650 i derive my sense of national pride from the things our society does for its less fortunate and im just not seeing that happening in vancouver i find it difficult to have a lot of pride in what this city and this countrys been doing about something as scandalous as having a downtown eastside exist in a major rich city i find it very difficult to have a lot of pride in that we talk about sharing our city in the mountains with the world well were also going to share the poverty we have here with the world the image we project around the world is not going to be as glowing as the our time to shine bumper stickers would have us believe
1719651 by the same token the apc and dera and pivot should be doing everything they can to bring the worlds spotlight onto the issue of poverty in canada and the condition of aboriginal communities in canada its perfectly acceptable and legitimate
1719652 i guess by writing a book and making a movie
1719653 having said that theres more traction maybe in other cities like tromsoe where people are starting to question the bid before its come theres a lot more success in that regard thats the place you stop the games
1719654 the olympics doesnt operate in a vacuum the iocs really the ultimate and most successful corporate parasite out there
1719655 it forces people to think about for whose benefit things happen you can look at what an imf loan does for a third world country and ask much the same question of what does the olympics coming to vancouver do for an average vancouverite or british columbian pretty much the same sort of story its basically shaking the money out of your pockets into theirs
1719656 sends her e mails that claim that needles are the devils work
1719657 its a good thing that weve seen that because it means theyre being honest about their data
1719658 with the harper government were seeing a drift to less evidence based public policy
1719659 why is stephen harper doing what hes doing hes a smart politician is he doing it really out of personal conviction or does he think there are more votes in not helping junkies than in helping junkies certainly in the united states thats what were seeing and its not a north american phenomenon thailands thaksin shinawatra went around and shot junkies and everyone loved it except the urban elite in bangkok who threw him out in a coup but the voters loved it
1719660 its strange because in the states now theres the battle about the reorganization of 50 billion in aids spending its being held up by these republican senators because they want to spend the money treating innocent women and babies with the belief that treatment is prevention
1719661 aids is a very clever virus inasmuch as it takes 10 years to begin to destroy your immune system so it gives itself a really good long time
1719662 the question is will hiv evolve to be less deadly over time so that it will be able to survive longer well thats what we do with treatment treatment also makes people less infectious in as much as it lowers viral load but heres the thing and i have to draw a diagram
1719663 in most of the world theyre starting treatment here when aids is destroying your immune system
1719664 i find it so difficult to understand why its okay for me to give you a really expensive antiretroviral for the rest of your life but its not okay for me to give you a clean needle i dont get that
1719665 no one wants to share a needle there used to be this idea that oh its part of the injecting culture its a sign of solidarity and blah blah blah thats like saying youd rather share a toothbrush with your boyfriend than have your own its icky people dont want to share equipment that they put into orifices of their body or make orifices with as it were so its actually the easiest area of hiv prevention condoms use is much more difficult because most of us would rather have sex without one than with one but with needles if theyre available and easy to use and youre not going to get arrested for carrying one mostly people will use their own
1719666 im coming to the view that you cant ever trump ideology with science i was doing a presentation at usaid called time to slaughter some sacred cows i was making slides of all the sacred cows grouped by here are the activist sacred cows here are the religious right sacred cows and then at the end i thought god you know i didnt have the public health sacred cows the number one public health sacred cow is that we keep talking about evidence based decision making but if theres one trope of our profession that is not evidence based its the idea that governments react to data i mean shit if theres one thing for which there is no evidence its the idea that if you do better research youll get a better policy
1719667 youve got the treatment action campaign jumping up and down asking for meds for the people who are already infected but theres no call for prevention none in a country where one in five adults is infected
1719668 wouldnt the voters say something about that wouldnt they say we know how to prevent this we want prevention we want services if its preying on the general population and you still cant sway the voters you expect politicians to be plonkers but what about us
1719669 i did a radio interview with cbc they wanted to talk about how rising food prices are going to increase hiv i was like uh huh talk me through that one she said oh well of course rising food prices are going to increase the number of women selling sex
1719670 the same thing is happening now in zimbabwe which the who and unaids have the gall to point to as a prevention success story you think the mugabe government is doing great things for hiv prevention first of all a lot of people at the highest risk have fled the country and number two no one can afford to go out and get drunk anymore or pick up girls so we measure a huge reduction in the number of casual partnerships and outside wives as they call them little wives not because of any prevention measures but because the economys gone to shit
1719671 you take what some might consider a fairly light hearted approach to drug use you talk about people using because its fun rather than because theyre hurting
1719672 how emotionally disturbed are you you seem pretty well adjusted whyd you do it these things are circular you could start something because its fun or because youre shy or because it makes you feel like part of the crowd there are all kinds of reasons automatically assuming that groups of people are vulnerable and abused is just a cop out addiction is certainly one way of escaping from a life that sucks but your life can start to suck because youve become an addict alcohol is the drug where we see that most of all do you start drinking because youre depressed maybe you go through a bad phase your boyfriend dumps you or whatever you start knocking back a bit and then suddenly its an addiction and then your life really starts to go south
1719673 the book was in a way a last gasp by packaging it differently and saying it to a different audience it was a last attempt to see if it made any difference ive worked for the world bank ive written my reports and ive given my input on strategy but no one paid a blind bit of notice and then you package it in this format in a book and you give a brown bag lunch at the world bank and 50 people show up including the head of programming and suddenly people are listening to what youre saying just because what because you thought of a good title the biggest story in the world im not saying anything new ive been saying it for years and its not just about me theres lot of people inside the industry whove been saying it but why is nothing changing thats my question to unaids executive director peter piot no one has said this is not true no one has objected to a single fact
1719674 the place of recent history in an age of forgetting the difficulty we seem to experience in making sense of the turbulent century that has just ended and in learning from it
1719675 look back upon the half generation separating the fall of communism in 1989 91 from the catastrophic american occupation of iraq as a decade and a half of wasted opportunities and political incompetence on both sides of the atlantic
1719676 in self serving half truths the triumph of the west the end of history the unipolar american moment the ineluctable march of globalization and the free market
1719677 we have memorialized it everywhere museums shrines inscriptions heritage sites even historical theme parks are all public reminders of the past
1719678 we encourage citizens and students to see the past and its lessons through the particular vector of their own suffering or that of their ancestors today the common interpretation of the recent past is thus composed of the manifold fragments of separate pasts each of them jewish polish serb armenian german asian american palestinian irish homosexual marked by its own distinctive and assertive victimhood
1719679 whatever the shortcomings of the older national narratives once taught in school
1719680 they had at least the advantage of providing a nation with past references for present experience
1719681 what then is it that we have misplaced in our haste to put the twentieth century behind us
1719682 curious as it may seem we or at least we americans have forgotten the meaning of war
1719683 was a time of virtually unbroken war continental war colonial war civil war
1719684 the united states avoided all that the u s was never occupied it did not lose vast numbers of citizens or huge swaths of national territory as a result of occupation or dismemberment although humiliated in neo colonial wars in vietnam and now in iraq it has never suffered the consequences of defeat
1719685 many american commentators and policymakers the message of the last century is that war works the implication of this reading of history has already been felt in the decision to attack iraq in 2003 for washington war remains an option in this case the first option for the rest of the developed world it has become a last resort
1719686 after war the second characteristic of the twentieth century was the rise and subsequent fall of the state
1719687 at the hands of multinational corporations transnational institutions and the accelerated movement of people money and goods outside their control
1719688 it was widely accepted that the modern state could and therefore should perform the providential role ideally without intruding excessively upon the liberty of its subjects
1719689 it became increasingly commonplace to treat the state not as the natural benefactor of first resort but as a source of economic inefficiency and social intrusion best excluded from citizens affairs wherever possible
1719690 it was not always self evident that the state is bad for you until very recently there were many people in europe asia and latin america and not a few in the u s who believed the contrary
1719691 we need to learn once again to think the state free of the prejudices we have acquired against it in the triumphalist wake of the wests cold war victory
1719692 how far we have lost the capacity even to conceive of public policy beyond a narrowly constructed economism
1719693 democracies in which there are no significant political choices to be made where economic policy is all that really matters and where economic policy is now largely determined by nonpolitical actors central banks international agencies or transnational corporations must either cease to be functioning democracies or accommodate once again the politics of frustration of populist resentment
1719694 the most powerful force possessed by the individual citizen is her own government government is the only organized mechanism that makes possible that level of shared disinterest known as the public good without this greater good the individual is reduced to a lesser narrower being limited to immediate needs
1719695 railways are a public service that is why the french invest in them so heavily as do the germans italians and spanish they treat the huge subsidy given their train system as an investment in the national and local economies the environment health tourism and social mobility
1719696 railways are not a business but a service that the state provides for its citizens at collective expense to treat trains like a firm best run by entrepreneurs whose shareholders expect a cash return on their investment is to misunderstand their very nature
1719697 we can see in retrospect that israels victory in june 1967 and its continuing occupation of the territories it conquered then have been the jewish states very own moral and political catastrophe
1719698 can be watched in real time by anyone with a computer terminal or a satellite dish

1719702 i am working on legislation that would require counties to send reassessment notices to taxpaying homeowners 60 days prior to the end of the countys fiscal year
1719703 many taxpayers in anderson county are still in the dark about the reassessed value of their property and the potential impact on their personal finances
1719704 it is all about information the more people understand about how government is using their money the more likely they are to hold elected officials accountable for fiscal responsibility

1719713 hey ill just send you a gfe and you can look it over and tell me what you think
1719714 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
1719715 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
1719716 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
1719717 if only i had a 1 000 000 or if only i had a great body etc then id be happy
1719718 its great to be spiritually aware and peaceful but i still feel there are things i want to achieve have and do how do i do that while still being mindful
1719719 she s at an age where she is thinking with her head not just her heart
1719720 this is a major message to america and america is listening
1719721 its really unfortunate that congress left for yet another recess without dealing with pending nominations especially for key officials dealing with energy issues like our nominee for deputy secretary of energy and three nominees to be commissioners of the cftc commodity futures trading commission
1719722 hes relaxed and asks the people at barcelona to understand his situation
1719723 it would be an act of solidarity in perfect harmony with the olympic sprit
1719724 it is now the moment for everyone to sit at the table and find a reasonable solution
1719725 of course this could affect the tournament and its in the interest of nobody to destroy what could be an extraordinary tournament this year but this is a matter for clubs fifa and the players to decide
1719726 we were not the reason behind delaying the election law we support the idea of holding elections this year
1719727 the latest u n proposal issued after meetings with kurdish president massoud barzani was a plot aimed at strengthening the kurds further in kirkuk
1719728 this is not a democratic issue or a republican issue it is an issue that affects all of us i am committed to working with all of my colleagues in a bipartisan manner to resolve the energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to act now
1719729 i think for obama the problem is drilling and is alienating environmental activists for mccain the problem is alienating anti tax advocates who are already sort of frustrated with him on some level
1719730 we have to drill here and drill now not wait and see whether theres areas to explore not wait and see whether theres a package that needs to be put together but drill here and drill now
1719731 it includes a limited amount of new offshore drilling and while i still dont believe thats a particularly meaningful short term or long term solution i am willing to consider it if its necessary to actually pass a comprehensive plan
1719732 i am not interested in making the perfect the enemy of the good particularly since theres so much good in this compromise that would actually reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1719733 a local person but i would like not to talk about it anymore
1719734 there does not seem to me to be any realistic chance that any of the strong clinton supporters are going to hold back by the time the election comes
1719735 one i love campaigning theres something the matter with you if you like political campaigning for yourself the other is we ran against each other but were good friends
1719736 even i called some obama people and said hey lets get on the air and hammer this guy mccain for being the biggest hypocrite there is
1719737 we let them nail us on that stuff and we havent come back as aggressively as we should
1719738 the obama people definitely need to worry about mccain setting the terms of the debate theres no reason any week should go by without hearing why mccain is an extension of the bush administration and thats what happened last week
1719739 anytime somebody distorts sen obamas record we push back quickly and forcefully with the truth
1719740 at the same time were not going to let the daily tit for tat distract us from our fundamental message of change
1719741 i think they realize like they did in the primary at the end of the day the brand or image of obama or the character of obama is what comes through
1719742 i think theres a way to hit back and to hit back in a way thats consistent with your brand
1719743 i do think its critical that obama stays on the offensive and i think for the most part he has been on the offensive
1719744 one of the advantages of obama is he doesnt listen to the beltway mentality
1719745 my sense is that obama does hit back rapidly effectively i think they hit back hard and theyre very effective with surrogates
1719746 its typical of democrats who are very anxious to win back the white house
1719747 i think its understandable that democrats are kind of on a hair trigger
1719748 in india even god cannot help he will be a silent spectator as he will also feel helpless

1719753 obama will give his secretary of defense and military commanders a new mission in iraq ending the war the removal of our troops will be responsible and phased directed by military commanders on the ground and done in consultation with the iraqi government military experts believe we can safely redeploy combat brigades from iraq at a pace of one to two brigades a month that would remove them in 16 months
1719754 i do not want to keep our troops in iraq a minute longer than necessary to secure our interests there our goal is an iraq that can stand on its own as a democratic ally and a responsible force for peace in its neighborhood our goal is an iraq that no longer needs american troops and i believe we can achieve that goal perhaps sooner than many imagine but i do not believe that anyone should make promises as a candidate for president that they cannot keep if elected to promise a withdrawal of our forces from iraq regardless of the calamitous consequences to the iraqi people our most vital interests and the future of the middle east is the height of irresponsibility it is a failure of leadership

1719767 because we originally developed this as a tv series george lucas felt that the crawl wasnt going to be effective as a way to introduce the audience to the tv series
1719768 he wanted it to be faster and he wanted to do it visually
1719769 we kind of borrowed from old serials that would have like the little circular wipes and show you what flash gordon was up to the last time you were at the theater and we did it in a more traditional sense
1719770 the narration also is kind of a nod to old newsreel footage that you could see during a war where they would update you on where the allies were at and their battle against the axis

1719786 and that speed before the point of impact was not excessive
1719787 it must be remembered that mr mcintosh did nothing wrong

1719829 ashwell has shown in this series that hes a match winner and the fact that hes already in england with his family added to the attraction of signing him
1719830 hes in form and its always good to sign a player who is playing with confidence hell join us at a vital stage of the season and add quality to our middle order hes an excellent fielder and he isnt involved in south africas one day international fixtures so he fits the bill for perfectly

1719833 het boek klimaatactivist in de politiek heb ik geschreven vanuit grote zorg om de klimaatverandering en het gebrek aan politieke actie om daar tegen op te treden in het boek analyseer ik ook welke maatschappelijke beweging er nodig is om tot een afdoende aanpak te komen ik blik daarbij ook terug op mijn eigen actieverleden en leg daarover uitgebreid verantwoording af ik vind dat ook de plicht van een politicus ik heb dat ook al eerder op verschillende manieren gedaan ik trek in het boek uitgebreid lering uit acties waar ik eerder aan heb meegedaan zoals de inbraak bij het ministerie van ez ik beschrijf daarbij waarom ik tot het inzicht ben gekomen dat acties zich moeten richten op de parlementaire besluitvorming en binnen de grenzen van de wet moeten blijven daarmee neem ik afstand van de actiemiddelen van 23 jaar geleden en spreek daarover een negatief oordeel uit ik geef aan waarom ik heb gekozen voor de parlementaire politiek om de klimaatcrisis aan te pakken
1719834 de keuzes die ik twintig jaar geleden maakte zijn op geen enkele manier meer de keuzes die ik nu zou maken willen we de klimaatcrisis effectief aanpakken dat zijn politici met lef nodig die de noodzakelijke maatregelen nemen en is er een zeer brede en open maatschappelijke beweging onontbeerlijk waar zeer zeer velen zich in herkennen en aan kunnen bijdragen
1719835 er zijn vragen gerezen rondom de aanstaande boekpresentatie van wijnand duyvendak in het kader van die presentatie heeft wijnand aangegeven in 1985 betrokken te zijn geweest bij een inbraak bij het ministerie van economische zaken in den haag daarbij werden documenten meegenomen waaruit bleek dat de toenmalige minister van economische zaken de kamer onjuist had voorgelicht over het voornemen om nieuwe kerncentrales te bouwen
1719836 groenlinks kent veel leden met een activistisch verleden de meesten bleven daarbij binnen de grenzen van de wet een enkeling zocht die grens op of passeerde die wijnand ging in het verleden een enkele keer over die grens heen in zijn boek omschrijft wijnand zijn persoonlijke ontwikkeling op dit terrein en het proces dat zich daarbij heeft voltrokken hij heeft nu afstand genomen van de methoden die toen werden gebruikt en kiest eenduidig voor de parlementaire weg en de acties binnen de wet
1719837 zijn boek gaat over de urgentie van het politieke handelen m b t het klimaatprobleem hij omschrijft dat ondanks die urgentie hij niet meer zou grijpen naar de middelen uit het verleden dat is de functionele reden van het opnemen van deze passage in zijn boek
1719838 groenlinks vraagt al zijn kandidaat parlementsleden of er zaken in het verleden zijn geweest die we moeten weten dat is ook het geval geweest met wijnand duyvendak in een tweetal indringende en openhartige gesprekken met de kandidatencommissie is het activistische verleden van wijnand aan de orde geweest daarbij heeft wijnand geen blad voor de mond genomen en is er een getrouw beeld gegeven over zijn verleden het nieuws over de inbraak is voor groenlinks dan ook geen verrassing
1719839 wijnand duyvendak heeft mij en de fractie al eerder ge nformeerd over zijn verleden ik heb hem aangemoedigd om daarover verantwoording af te leggen ik vind dat acties altijd binnen de grenzen van de wet dienen te blijven en wijs er op dat wijnand duyvendak dat inzicht in zijn boek uitdraagt en verantwoording aflegt over de acties in de jaren tachtig in het algemeen vind ik het van groot belang dat politici openheid betrachten over hun maatschappelijke activiteiten in het verleden en het maatschappelijke debat daarover niet schuwen
1719840 caps for sale a tale of a peddler some monkeys and their monkey business
1719841 please get me out of here and away from this maniac terrier
1719842 thank goodness they are gone and i can kick back and be my true laid back self since i dont have to entertain the humans its so tiring being a dog
1719843 im going to let you cool your heels in jail until the chief gets back
1719844 and i said to keep quiet youre going to jail
1719845 lucky for you that the chief is at his daughters wedding hell be in a good mood when he gets back
1719846 have some of the worlds most beautiful seafood big beautiful perfect looking but i tell you it is all tasteless
1719847 the clams were so fresh they were still squirting in the box
1719848 with a sharp management program you will find that all the other parts of the e discovery process easy to stick to
1719849 how do you handle it when a lawyer comes in and says preserve
1719850 what preserve this is not just handing them a backup tape
1719851 so if it costs 1 million to process it out of that 100 000 is actually useful to your company
1719852 if you have aggressive records management you get rid of a lot of crap you keep only the useful information
1719853 so the more information you give a lawyer that is irrelevant the more it costs
1719854 dont forget lawyers may be charging 500 per hour reading an average of 80 documents an hour do the math
1719855 and if its so old that its not possible to find the appropriate technology then why didnt you dispose of this data
1719856 think of the storage required most of it is not useful information retention is difficult and if you need to look for something its difficult
1719857 when you have a narrow window when there is no litigation purge everything thats not related to your business
1719858 for example in the case of pedophiles if an employee makes a comment on another employees daughter even if its stored at home the company is liable
1719859 so many people are used to texting that its leading to interesting grammar and symbols
1719860 and its easy to hit the wrong button and send a message to 40 000 people also something that looks humorous today may not seem funny to a judge and jury two years later
1719861 you can do collection and preservation with in house it people and counsel
1719862 if you follow some off the cuff plan and not follow your policy thats trouble
1719863 but if you do it in good faith and show you follow the regular procedures its safer
1719864 if the data is encrypted and you lose the token key that sucks
1719865 if only one damning file is encrypted you had better be prepared to defend it
1719866 the acquiring companys first thought is to trash everything not related to the business you bought
1719867 but what about the financial data on a server ive seen companies where no one dares to turn a server on they have to rehire the it people and they may pay five times the pay to bring back someone who was let go just two weeks ago
1719868 ive seen one company pay someone a quarter million dollars for one weeks worth of work
1719869 all discovery doesnt always lead to relevant trial admissible evidence
1719870 sometimes it gets so bad i will retire to my chamber with the lawyers so we can get acquainted with each other and get everyone up to speed
1719871 your obligation once you know you are in litigation land is to start moving to preserve information right away
1719872 you played 4 5 1 against a side from lithuania and you deserved to lose
1719873 save your settings and off you go make sure of course that your system permissions allow anonymous users to post comments

1719923 in prison i had time to contemplate my ideology and discuss it with other prisoners
1719924 for a year after my return i continued with hizb ut tahrir but i was suffering inner turmoil questioning the ideology of islamism is like questioning your faith but this is what i realised islam is a religion this religion can cater for more than one political ideology god did not reveal one political or economic system he only laid out guidelines so much of it is open to interpretation i studied in prison as an islamist i believed that sovereignty is for god alone but then i realised that sovereignty is a modern concept and that anyone who says sovereignty is for god is saying he is god because he is saying that he has sole right to say what god thinks isnt it about time we realised that political ideas are not from scripture but drawn up according to our preferences in terms of identity i realised that the companions of the prophet called themselves by their ethnic titles for example salman al farsi salman the persian so you can be muslim and pakistani muslim and syrian or muslim and british we have to promote debate so muslims can develop a social contract which allows us to replace dictators islamism has to take responsibility for the way it has contributed to radicalism i believe that islamism is a modern phenomenon that has been attached to islam and is detrimental to islam islamism is an ideology that believes sovereignty belongs to god and there is such a thing as an islamic state i dont think there is an islamic state anymore than there is an islamic car

1719930 i think all the world would gain by setting commerce at perfect liberty
1719931 i really believe that the reason why the democratic leadership has not brought the american energy act or a compromise bill like that to the floor is because it would pass
1719932 what exactly has the democrat controlled house done for us lately well it authorized the fda to regulate tobacco it apologized for slavery and jim crow laws and lets not forget the house transportation committee moved to ban in flight cell phone use
1719933 does obama have the sort of adviser a candidate most needs someone sufficiently unenthralled to tell him when he has worked one pedal on the organ too much if so obama should be told enough already with the we are who we have been waiting for rhetorical cotton candy that elevates narcissism to a political philosophy
1719934 when one side sees their own country as the problem and the other side sees their own country as the solution somebody tell me where you compromise with that
1719935 any news account biography or political history of the twentieth century that talks about who won the cold war a complicated historical reality for sure and does not include alexander solzhenitsyn with reagan thatcher and pope john paul ii is not only incomplete but wrong solzhenitsyn was the inside man
1719936 edward e erickson who wrote two major works on solzhenitsyn argues that the key to understanding solzhenitsyn is christianity the russian orthodox faith that framed solzhenitsyns worldview
1719937 gradually it was disclosed to me that the line separating good and evil passes not through states nor between classes nor between political parties either but right through every human heart
1719938 such is the debt of free spirits to alexander solzhenitsyn that we owe it to him at least to consider anything he asks us to consider
1719939 the capacity for self deception and self justification is large
1719940 the exclamation of a journalist at the unity minority news media gathering this weekend sums up the star struck reverence that fuels the obama phenomenon he touched me and yet hes sooo down to earth hurtling toward a government of the stupid by the stupid for the stupid we go
1719941 in mccains universe the planets rotate around the sun in a predictable pattern in obamas universe he is the sun
1719942 in a speech recently barack obama said hes distantly related to the famous 19th century gunslinger wild bill hickok after hearing this john mccain said big deal i went to high school with him
