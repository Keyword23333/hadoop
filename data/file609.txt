6090005 when i read a commentary from john martellaro of the mac observer this week suggesting that apple might want to use some of its huge cash reserves to construct a highly automated manufacturing facility as a hedge against poor working conditions and uncertainties in asia i was struck by a single paragraph that contained a quote from steve jobs dating back to february of 1996

6090009 rather than wait six months for a scan at a hospital we provided them in a couple of days
6090010 it took five years for the hospital to get a ct scanner which speaks volumes
6090011 our good friend leroi moore passed on and gave his ghost up today and we will miss him forever
6090012 tell him hes expletive amazing and i want to meet him
6090013 there were several other clubs interested in signing gavin but he got back to me saying hed like to join us
6090014 i have received intimation from the gretna fc administrator of their resignation from the scottish football league with immediate effect
6090015 i have accepted this resignation on behalf of the scottish football league and accordingly we now have a vacancy in the third division and are seeking applications
6090016 but we and the sfl had to make sure we protected the integrity of our league
6090017 i have sympathy with the people at gretna the players the staff and the fans but the sfl gave them as long as they could
6090018 somebody up there likes us we havent had much luck recently so im delighted
6090019 our long term aim was always to get in to the sfl but we are not counting any chickens
6090020 we have a new 500 seater stand and concrete terracing right round the ground
6090021 the only stumbling block might be the floodlights but we had planned do see to them this calendar year
6090022 theres a lot of young talent but some experience and knowledge is needed
6090023 im looking to prove what i can do for paul simpson
6090024 and i feel i can break into the first team
6090025 because there are no funds at the moment to carry on everybody has been made redundant
6090026 we assume for most of us its the end of the line at gretna
6090027 he confirmed that he is still in negotiations with the scottish football league with a view to obtaining entry into the first division
6090028 its a shock to the players that have got contracts not only for the rest of the season but for next season
6090029 and its a shock im sure to the local people for whom the club is very very important
6090030 he has not contacted me or my representatives or replied to any letters we have sent
6090031 i can only assume that he is in serious difficulty
6090032 he has put 8m into this company and it appears to be almost lost
6090033 but he has not come forward and had not contacted me there is no rescue package from mr mileson
6090034 we cant do a cvl creditors voluntary liquidation because the company would go back to mr mileson
6090035 the spl will allow me to transfer gretna into a new company to avoid that
6090036 hes a big powerful lad that can play in the middle of the park hes got good feet is a good passer of the ball and has a presence about him
6090037 i had one offer on the table which i decided at that late stage i would pursue
6090038 the prospective purchaser had produced a business plan based on first division football and so he has formally withdrawn his offer
6090039 effectively we are still technically in the third division but i cant complete fixtures next season
6090040 then a few years ago mr mileson took over and injected a lot of money into the club and it enjoyed a lot of success on the football pitch
6090041 but if you take away the benefactor the person supplying the money then financially you have a real mess
6090042 i live here on less than a dollar a month
6090043 theres no end to how much you can still learn but thats also why people stop training they cant take that feeling of becoming a beginner again and again

6090068 the new farm bill offers a major departure from traditional policy
6090069 farmers have a choice to make and that choice to participate in the program is irrevocable
6090070 it took eight temporary extensions of the expiring law and two overridden vetoes to pass the food conservation and energy act in june 2008
6090071 people want to know about axle ratios and engines for pulling loads
6090072 they ask questions about specific uses because pickups are the mainstay of the farming and construction business most everyone has a pickup a lot of women drive pickups and suvs
6090073 of course fuel mileage is becoming a bigger and bigger issue
6090074 probably the most often asked question is when will gm put duramax diesel engines in half ton and three quarter ton pickups
6090075 the fact there is no sales tax on farm delivered diesel is big right now and farmers want diesel engines in all their trucks large and small
6090076 id say 80 percent of the trucks sold in california are four wheel drive
6090077 itll be a little different coming to a place ive never seen before a course where i didnt win last year
6090078 itll be kind of weird that its not the course where i won

6090086 if i dont play well these two weeks id have no complaints if i dont get picked it would be totally acceptable the first tee of a ryder cup is not the place to be if youre not flying on all cylinders
6090087 i actually played ok there id be the first to say so if i was terrible but i wasnt
6090088 i want cotton folks to know im their friend i believe in agriculture and that if we let the family farmer fail weve failed as a nation
6090089 and i wanted to be sure we had an advocate for agriculture
6090090 with constantly rising energy costs were finding it harder and harder to stay in business
6090091 with declining cotton acres over the past three years weve gone from ginning 30 000 bales to only 6 000 last year our cotton warehouse is getting smaller and smaller in past years weve employed 40 seasonal workers now were just in survival mode
6090092 we sell fertilizer seed and chemicals and government regulations and environmental restrictions have made it more difficult to compete and have made our operations more expensive and harder to finance
6090093 weve added non agriculture related businesses to try and allow us to hold on to our ag operations
6090094 but energy is by far the biggest problem people are having to choose between the gas pump and the grocery store costs are moving up so fast were having to spend all our time on efforts just to meet expenses
6090095 were passionate about what we do and we want to stay in this business
6090096 we ginned 79 000 bales at our two gins in 2006 in 2007 we ginned 44 000 this year we expect it will be less than 25 000
6090097 this trend all across the mid south is having a dramatic effect on local economies
6090098 well run just one of our gins and our normal complement of 56 seasonal employees will be cut in half
6090099 fuel and energy costs are astronomical we used to dry a bale of cotton for 1 now its 6 just for energy
6090100 now theres just one in addition to the problems of declining acres energy costs etc increasing problems with regulatory agencies labor shortages and immigration and customs enforcement are adding complexity and costs to our operation
6090101 our volume has gone from 54 000 bales in 2006 to 28 000 last year and probably 25 000 this year
6090102 the wild price swings have increased market uncertainty and greatly affected our ability to use these pricing functions
6090103 liquid nitrogen that was 300 this year is going to be 600 in 2009 increases of this magnitude will mean less cotton and corn
6090104 even though grain prices are much higher with these high input costs our margins remain the same inputs are killing producers
6090105 the cotton market was as high as ive seen but few producers could take advantage of it because markets werent functioning as they should we couldnt hedge our risks if producers dont have some sort of price discovery mechanism in a fair open manner they cant price their products
6090106 we have insisted that any reductions should come with increased market access for u s commodities so far that has failed to materialize
6090107 we havent had an energy policy since jimmy carter was president our only policy has been to let the energy companies get richer and richer
6090108 i personally shop at the grocery store and i see how the prices of milk eggs and everything else have gone up all due mainly to energy and transportation costs i dont know a farmer anywhere whos better off as a result of high food prices
6090109 weve got to quit being so dependent on foreign oil there are a lot of bright minds in this country and i believe they can come up with ways to solve this problem
6090110 anti american push backs i think we should look at each agreement on its merits before its approved
6090111 in the midst of these very challenging times there are some very positive things going on and despite the problems we believe cotton will come back
6090112 we need a level playing field a chance to compete fairly and ways to deal with input costs
6090113 these men are likely following the evolutionary indoctrination they receive in school and on tv
6090114 did the water just get warm adam my white master
6090115 had the two men given the supposed specimen to a research facility we would have had less reason to doubt the authenticity of their claim
6090116 hasta el d a de ayer en horas de la ma ana supuestamente cont bamos con 78 votos cuando el partido liberal que realmente desde hac a d as entiendo ya hab a cuadrado todo arrancan a votar en bancada es decir todos los 36 votos entonces ah se baraja y se nos cae todo
6090117 en esto nadie quiere perder y es una cosa curiosa porque a m el partido de la u el jueves pasado hubo 23 personas que me hab an dado el aval y lo hicieron p blico y no se ayer se reunieron y esos votos desaparecieron lo mismo que de cambio radical
6090118 no hab an las garant as suficientes para competir yo era consciente de que competir con el doctor volmar p rez teniendo toda la maquinaria y la burocracia iba a ser bastante complicado pero finalmente somet mi nombre
6090119 es justamente el libro que primero escrib a mano que m s tarde se convirti en blog y que luego he reelaborado a lo largo de estos meses
6090120 the year we started the business reliable racing supply i had gone to norway to follow up on an idea that they were making plastic slalom poles i contacted them and they sent us a bunch some people said i was just trying to make money thats not true
6090121 i can remember walking around the sidewalks with skis on
6090122 it was the great depression it got so bad especially in canada they really got hit hard so the family picked up and moved back to the states
6090123 soon after my father got a job with brown company the largest pulp and paper mill in the country in my mothers hometown berlin n h there were a lot of norwegians who immigrated to berlin to work in the mill they taught us all how to ski
6090124 every sunday morning we all gathered to jump and have meets
6090125 they had cross country races i learned the whole sport and it was great with downhill there were no lifts you walked up
6090126 for bindings you wrapped an inner tube around your ankle
6090127 one of the best things that keeps you going in skiing is running slalom gates
6090128 its not like around here where ski centers are close together out west theyre all spread out you had to go 1 000 miles to get to reno the money wasnt great but that didnt matter because i was doing something i loved
6090129 i probably wouldnt have gotten back into it without that
6090130 on sundays kids that could go the fastest we threw them in the car and took them to a different place each week
6090131 we started right here in the basement of our house marilyn and i
6090132 my first order was for bibs they needed them immediately so we worked all night to get it done when we delivered the order the guy said you guys are quite reliable who do i make the check out to
6090133 we didnt even have a company name yet so i said make it out to reliable racing thats how it started nobody had put together a company that supplied ski areas especially racing
6090134 we sold tons of stuff every year we went to europe for trade shows and brought back stuff nobody had ever heard of at one time or another with one product or another we have sold to almost every ski area in north and south america
6090135 hed never heard of them and didnt know how to use them
6090136 all the way back to glens falls i sold every single one of them
6090137 i used roller skis to show people how to use them in winter i put on clinics i remember later i went back to this one store representatives from k2 and rossignol were there waiting as soon as the owner saw me he took me first thats the way it was
6090138 die fotos sind konzentriert auf die gesichter zumeist auf die russischen gesichter in diesem sinn ist das sehr wertvoll weil es die lage revitalisiert
6090139 die soldaten sehen dass sie etwas gemacht haben das nicht richtig war das darf in keiner armee passieren
6090140 heinz hosch hat nicht wie andere pressefotografen aus dem sicheren hotelzimmer die massen fotografiert er war immer mitten drin
6090141 it took me a while to let things go you just have to work through that stuff it takes a few years divorce is really awful a lot of people go through that more than once and i dont know how they do it i mean once was enough for me
6090142 were in this time when you have to be young and pretty weve gone back to that
6090143 there were a lot of people 10 or 15 years ago who were putting on funny clothes and playing some kind of country music who were dabbling
6090144 blue mountain was really authentic they were blending country blues and rock in an interesting way that only two or three bands were doing
6090145 it was one of the most happening places culturally in the country
6090146 fat possum records was based there so you had r l burnside and junior kimbrough and all those guys and oxford had this literary scene with larry brown and barry hannah there was a lot going on and we were kind of musically in the center of it
6090147 theres probably going to be periods of time where im probably not going to be making enough money from music and ill have to get an additional job
6090148 i mean thats how things have changed before we sold enough records and we made enough money on the road where we could really not worry about that for a while live show attendance has been up and down for everybody not just for us weve been lucky because we still have the markets where we did really well and were still doing really well but that could go away too
6090149 i have to say the one thing im glad to see is were also picking up some younger fans people who have heard of the band but never seen us or heard about us from their older brothers and sisters because if we were just playing to our old fans those people are like in the 30s and 40s now so theyve got kids you know theyre not packing the clubs anymore
6090150 a show and tell featuring locals artists and designers who will have a few minutes to talk about their creative endeavor or business its a way to see whats going on in seattles creative community network and be inspired

6090154 certainly well want to roll it out as quickly as possible
6090155 having said that if there is some sort of discrimination that comes out in the reporting that is arguably contrary to the code then i would also feel that it would be open to a complainant to challenge the reporting as being discriminatory on the grounds of race
6090156 im of the opinion that even if i dont like what you have to say i have to accept it theres lots of times i dont like what i read but im not the judge of that
6090157 im having a real philosophical problem with barbara hall recognizing freedom of expression and at the same time telling the media what their responsibility is
6090158 i wanted to call every single one of the nominees in because if were going to have a human rights system in ontario i think we deserve as ontarians to know what the individual philosophies are of these tribunal members

6090164 one might expect a lobbyist to hedge their bets by donating roughly equal amounts to members of both parties
6090165 lobbyists and the organizations they work for have disclosed nearly 100 000 contributions and other payments linked to members of congress and other top officials
6090166 used the new database to calculate a total of 26 million just in direct campaign contributions by individual lobbyists to lawmakers over the first half of this year
6090167 he found over 200 million in other political expenditures by lobbying organizations contained in reports filed under the new law though he acknowledged problems with the new database that make that number only a very rough estimate
6090168 my whole career has been about resolving access issues this is my battle horse
6090169 ive never hidden what i do im not ashamed of it in fact im quite proud
6090170 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything
6090171 they dont have insight on how bad losses are going to get
6090172 a win is always good its a good habit to have
6090173 whenever you give him the ball you know that more than 100 percent is coming out of him
6090174 praveen kumar provided valuable support with 3 34 india started its reply shakily losing two wickets to seamer kulasekara in the first five overs
6090175 when we went out to bat we thought 175 would have been a very good score on this wicket
6090176 on a wicket like this you have to work hard for your runs unfortunately we didnt do that here
6090177 the average american woman will spend 17 years caring for her children and 18 years caring for her parents
6090178 carolinas healthcare system realizes these people need a medical home to access
6090179 many practices dont accept new medicare patients because the reimbursement doesnt cover the costs
6090180 this is a commitment by chs to underwrite the practice and address the needs of older patients
6090181 we want our patients to stay at home as long as they can but also be healthy at home

6090187 wynona ward didnt want anybody to endure the abuse that she had suffered
6090188 she built have justice will travel into a major force in vermont and a national example she spends half her time fundraising and now has a budget that supports five full time lawyers her group has been able to assist thousands of women
6090189 for the dozen people who appear in the book we the co authors went across the country to do new interviews and investigate exactly how they had achieved success
6090190 these people began working for change in their communities because they cared passionately about an issue close to their lives something wasnt working and they wanted to fix it they became involved
6090191 all of them share a special quality thats almost disappeared from public debate
6090192 its an approach that can work for all of us in communities across the nation the local heroes of your america point the way forward
6090193 people look at the wreckage in the world and ask
6090194 your america is a wonderful tonic for cynicism and despair it brims with real life heroes from scholars to barbers to bureaucrats to businesspeople who remind us that one determined person can begin to turn the world
6090195 now is a welcome and nutritious addition to the rich menu of choices available on pbs and equally important it is fearless about challenging conventional wisdom a too rare quality these days
6090196 most of the featured individuals are ordinary citizens and their abilities to devise creative solutions to serious problems and persevere against vastly influential antagonistic interests will inspire and embolden all readers
6090197 to each participant siceloff and maloney posed the question how do you get started if you want to make a difference in america the responses are open honest inspiring and even heartbreaking testimonials that cover a range of social issues across the political social and economic spectrum
6090198 the writing in your america is straightforward and has a simple almost broadcast style that makes for a quick but thoughtful read
6090199 then 9 11 happened and i couldnt take it anymore
6090200 the response to 9 11 the right was saying this is pure evil were facing and the left was saying how are we at fault for this
6090201 hooray i am done with high school and about to start at the university in a few weeks
6090202 in that time you learn a lot about safety and side effects and how to use it
6090203 those getting it early should be the ones who really want it and willing to accept the risk
6090204 well you know the response we got from that accidental announcement was very interesting ill have to leave it at that for now
6090205 we are still of the view stubborn as we are that we have not seen the end of the problems and therefore financials have not made a relative bottom
6090206 when theres no longer a need to raise fresh capital in the delevering process and you can actually look at these entities and say theyre well capitalized to run their businesses in the new paradigm that would be to me the sign that weve hit bottom
6090207 when dilution is the solution youre not at the bottom
6090208 we still have in this country thousands of banks we dont need thousands of banks pick your favorite european country you can count the number of banks on one maybe two hands
6090209 that will be the sign that we have a financial system thats back on track
6090210 well compared to yesterdays model yes thats probably true but thats gone that models gone whether its for the investment banks or the commercial banks
6090211 to be the only view that is truly faithful to scripture and that fits the scientific evidence far better than the reigning old earth evolutionary theory
6090212 belief in millions of years undermines the bibles teaching on death and on the character of god
6090213 my allegiance to senator mccain becomes stronger with any assault that tries to deter my loyalty to him i can only pray that good people see her for what she is sick of mind

6090215 if you do not forgive others their trespasses neither will your father forgive your trespasses
6090216 father forgive them for they know not what they do
6090217 if we confess our sins he is faithful and just and will forgive our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness

6090221 alcuni dicono che la pioggia brutta ma non sanno che permette di girare a testa alta con il viso coperto dalle lacrime
6090222 e credere in te soltanto giurare in te soltanto riporre in te soltanto la mia fede la mia forza il mio orgoglio tutto il mio mondo tutto quel che sogno e tutto quel che spero
6090223 vorrei tornare bambino perch le ginocchia sbucciate fanno meno male di un cuoreinfranto
6090224 sussurra al mondo ci che sei ma urla a te stesso per capirti
6090225 se sei tra questi ti assicuro che non sei coglione anzi hai buon gusto e giudizio
6090226 and you who were already conquered in your greatest victories what will you be in the approaching defeat
6090227 hey buffy its the one i was telling you about casey carlyle shes about my age the program says she only started competitively skating in the last couple of years but shes already good enough to maybe qualify for the next olympics
6090228 you knowing more about the skaters than i do you made so much fun of me back when i worshipped dorothy hammill and made mom put ice skating on when you wanted to watch cartoons
6090229 its a little sister privilege and you were being mean anyway
6090230 but seriously all i had to do was read the program all your old favorites grew up and went pro or retired skaters have a pretty short shelf life
6090231 so if this ones just started competing what did she do before hand
6090232 physics if you can believe it she could have gotten into harvard if she wanted to but she chose to skate instead ooh
6090233 5 in february 1971 a meeting took place at the offices of mr joness solicitors stone and stone they saw both the claimants parents and while they advised her mother that she could get independent legal advice they certainly did not insist upon it 6 according to the undisputed evidence of mrs davis they advised her that mr jones wanted her to transfer the former matrimonial home to him she declined but then it was suggested that she should transfer the property to mr jones on the basis that her share would pass to the claimant in due course that solution appealed subject to it being guaranteed that it would happen the solicitor said it would be put in writing on the day that mrs davis attended the solicitors office they wrote to her by letter dated 23 february 1971 in the following terms further to your call upon us today we confirm that we are acting on behalf of your husband in connection with his matrimonial affairs and it was agreed by you that provided you were satisfied that your husband would ensure that susan ann received your half interest in the property 88 farm road morden jointly owned by you and mr jones or alternatively that she had one half of the net proceeds of sale after allowing for the outstanding mortgage as at todays date of 3 000 you would transfer your interest to your husband and renounce your interest under the matrimonial homes act a memorandum of agreement signed by mr jones was enclosed it read to mrs kathleen rose jones re 88 farm road morden in consideration of your conveying your one half interest in the above freehold property to me i agree and undertake to ensure that this one half beneficial interest devolves to our daughter susan ann and that in the event of my selling the property at any future time then i undertake to pay to her one half of the net proceeds of sale after taking into account the outstanding mortgage of 3 000
6090234 she that is mrs staden was not intended to have the rights of a tenant in common to occupy the property or to call for an account of any rents or to call for the sale of the property the timing of events precluded the documents of february 1971 being a binding declaration of trust the agreement remained executory and in the event unexecuted
6090235 the difficulty faced by the claimant is that she and not her mother is bringing this action and her mother has not chosen to do so if it was her mother bringing it the picture would have been much clearer in the nineteenth century it was thought that children would be able to enforce a marriage settlement in chancery though not parties to the original agreement what happened here was an agreement to benefit a child on divorce is it so very different in kind i doubt it but there is no authority directly to point and i would be slow to say that the boundaries of equitable intervention in terms of specific performance or constructive trust have been pushed so far without further being sure of the presence of those twin stepping stones of precedent and principle to pass over i am conscious that there is a well established line of relatively modern authority at least in chancery terms referred to in gray and gray which says that the court ought not to give voluntary beneficiaries by indirect means what they cannot obtain directly
6090236 there was of course no question of a resulting trust as there might have been if the occupant of the house had been a former owner who had sold the freehold on the faith of a similar promise in the present case the defendant did on the facts found sell and convey the property on the faith of the oral undertaking and would not otherwise have done so and the undertaking must be assumed to have been regarded as reserving to her benefit worth at least 150 or three eights of the contemporary market value of the property without vacant possession
6090237 we therefore see no reason why the words of the undertaking should not be given the most favourable construction from the defendants point of view of which they are properly capable similar words in deeds and wills have frequently been held to create a life interest determinable apart from the special considerations introduced by the settled land act 1925 on the beneficiary ceasing to occupy the premises see for example re carnes settled estates re boyers settled estates in our view that is the meaning which should in the circumstances of the present case be placed on the words of the oral undertaking found by the county court to have been given by the plaintiff
6090238 the introduction of the words as tenant at will of them in the old doctrine set out in coke on littleton 55a that a tenancy at will expressed to be at the will of one party only is by implication of law to be at the will of the other party also create a difficulty in the defendants way but all the rest of the agreement is inconsistent with the defendant being a tenant at the will of the landlords if those six words are inconsistent with the rest of the document i agree we should disregard them if they make the document ambiguous then any ambiguity in the language of the agreement resulting from the attempt of the landlords lawyers to have the best of different worlds ought clearly to be resolved against those who drew up the agreement and put it forward to give it the meaning for which mr pugh persuasively contends would be to turn it into a trap for the defendant the successors in title to the owners who put forward this agreement took the cottage subject to the agreement and ought to be in no better position to turn her out than her predecessors who agreed not to
6090239 in their lordships opinion the intention of the parties must be gathered from the conveyance and mr irwins letter the intention as manifested by the conveyance is clear enough all the interest of the defendant mabel carleton whether legal or equitable is intended to pass the letter contains nothing inconsistent with and a good deal to confirm this the testator was evidently intending to be put in a position to grant a lease or leases of the property on such terms as he might think desirable which could not be properly done if the defendant mabel carleton remained equitable owner of a moiety of the property further the testators promise to devise a moiety of the property in her favour is inconsistent with her being intended to remain in equity the owner of such a moiety whether the testator did or did not make such a device a contract to devise a beneficial interest assumes an estate in the person who contracts sufficient to enable the contract to be performed and it would be contrary to ordinary equitable principles to construe a promise to settle as a present declaration of trust with great deference their lordships think that the trial judge in holding that the letter created a trust did not give sufficient weight to these considerations in their opinion it is impossible to impute to the parties any intention of creating a trust in praesenti
6090240 1 interpretation is the ascertainment of the meaning which the document would convey to a reasonable person having all the background knowledge which would reasonably have been available to the parties in the situation in which they were at the time of the contract 2 the background was famously referred to by lord wilberforce as the matrix of fact but this phrase is if anything an understated description of what the background may include subject to the requirement that it should have been reasonably available to the parties and to the exception to be mentioned next it includes absolutely anything which would have affected the way in which the language of the document would have been understood by a reasonable man 3 the law excludes from the admissible background the previous negotiations of the parties and their declarations of subjective intent they are admissible only in an action for rectification the law makes this distinction for reasons of practical policy and in this respect only legal interpretation differs from the way we would interpret utterances in ordinary life the boundaries of this exception are in some respects unclear but this is not the occasion on which to explore them
6090241 it has been held that where a party makes an oral representation as to the effect of a document for the purpose of its being acted upon and it is acted upon and there is no qualification in the representation suggesting that the document is not to govern the relationship of the parties the representor cannot afterwards be heard to say that the representation is not true see de tchihatchef v the salerni coupling ltd 1932 1 ch 330 1931 all er rep 233 in that case the representation was made after the agreement had been executed but in my judgment the position would have been the same if the representation had been made before the agreement was executed
6090242 it is true that he need not use the words i declare myself a trustee but he must do something which is equivalent to it and use expressions which have the equivalent meaning the court is not at liberty to construe words otherwise than according to their proper meaning for a man to make himself a trustee there must be an expression of intention to become a trustee whereas words of present gift show an intention to give over property to another and not to retain it in the donors own hands for any purpose fiduciary or otherwise
6090243 it is we think clearly a mistake to suppose that the equitable principle on which a constructive trust is raised against a person who insists on the absolute character of a conveyance to himself for the purpose of defeating a beneficial interest which according to the true bargain was to belong to another is confined to cases in which the conveyance itself was fraudulently obtained the fraud which brings the principle into play arises as soon as the absolute character of the conveyance is set up for the purpose of defeating the beneficial interest and that is the fraud to cover the statute of frauds or the corresponding provisions of the law of property act 1925 cannot be called in aid in cases in which no written evidence of a real bargain is available nor is it in our opinion necessary that the bargain on which the absolute conveyance is made should include any express stipulation that the grantee is in so many words to hold as trustee it is enough that the bargain should have included a stipulation under which some sufficiently defined beneficial interest in the property was to be taken by another

6090245 if power were never anything but repressive if it never did anything but say no do you really think one would be brought to obey it what makes power hold good what makes it accepted is simply the fact that it doesnt only weigh on us as a force that says no but that it traverses and produces things it induces pleasure forms knowledge produces discourse

6090336 although the methods developed are for diagnosing west nile virus in horses the procedures can be easily modified to develop new antibody tests for humans and wildlife
6090337 it is essential to test wildlife for infection to determine the ecological and epidemiological aspects of west nile virus infections in nature so that we can try to control the disease by managing mosquito populations

6090362 the disposal of human wastes is a subject normally buried in euphemism and avoidance at least in public privately every single person on the planet is intimately concerned on a day to day even hour to hour basis with the need to relieve themselves in a congenial place and fashion the physiological necessity of excretion cannot be averted even if it cannot be spoken of no one can attain the purity of the perfect saint who manages to digest every single thing he or she consumes a power that certain holy men in the ancient world were believed to possess even the most rigid toilet training can enable a person to postpone their visits to the rest room only for a certain length of time every day each human being emits an average of slightly less than 100 grams of feces and roughly one and a half litres of urine even though this regular process of bodily evacuation may not be thought of as dishonourable and base a phrase from victorian england it is nonetheless regarded as noxious and unmentionable by most of the human race this is an unspoken subject in almost every culture except in the context of ribaldry and scatological humour the organs of defecation are close to or identified with those used for sex another delicate subject the subspecies of engineers who preoccupy themselves with mire are viewed askance as if they were mildly touched and in the uk plumbers earn more than other kinds of household fixers because of bravery in the face of ordure the very word toilet at least upon the anglo saxon tongue has an awkward and embarrassed ring and its use is often regarded as vulgar that there is a worldwide sanitary crisis is indisputable over 40 per cent of people in the developing world still depend on a bucket a bush the banks of a stream a backstreet or some other sheltered place for their several daily emissions

6090380 you have to do something it doesnt have to be college you could pursue a trade lengthy foray here into the examples of an uncle who is a very successful stonemason and my beloved hairdressers boyfriend who after unfulfilling office jobs has more happily taken up installing solar cell panels i cant stand to see someone who is so smart not doing anything youre a smart guy you could go to college so easily college is an easy way to try living somewhere else since you say you dont want to stay where you are forever a weak assertion that college is impossibly expensive was quashed by my pointing out the options of state schools and community colleges when i was your age i did things i was engaged i traveled i had jobs i went to college when i was your age i was studying in madrid and all i had to do for that was fill out some forms and get a couple of professors to write letters and then my college bought me tickets to madrid and found me a place to live there i went all over madrid not knowing the language well and not knowing anything and i learned so much this appeared to score as my nephew looked a bit like hed been punched in the gut you have a lot of girlfriends now but ten years from now when youre still living in your mothers basement and you dont have a job and you arent doing anything no one is going to want to date you you can get away with that with charm when youre 19 but when youre 29 it wont work
6090381 sudan is an independent country with its own strong justice system our judges can decide for themselves on penalties even for a president

6090383 we can get traffic moving across this in two weeks if the russians dont blow it up again
6090384 but if they do blow it up a second time maybe at least theyll admit they did it
6090385 the russian soldiers showed up on saturday afternoon and they waited until a passenger train had just passed
6090386 they were using the soviet era explosive trotyl and as you can see they did a very thorough job
6090387 the russian soldiers come down to the water every night they set up search lights and they bathe
6090388 we talk with them and they joke that they knocked down the bridge so they could wash without people in trains seeing them naked
6090389 no trains are going either way tbilisi is pretty much cut off
6090390 there is practically no way to move freight between the coast and our capital
6090391 if we arent interfered with we can get this bit of the rail line going you can see how the boys are working
6090392 but until the russians leave our economy is going to stay in the 18th century
6090393 i started my own farming in 1969 with 50 acres of land and today i grow grapes on 14 000 acres out of which 10 000 acres is owned by me and the rest is on lease

6090403 you just arrived in panama and youre already at punta chame
6090404 hello can i stay at your house for a week
6090405 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
6090406 last thursday union bosses from across the state joined governor steve beshear david boswell 2nd congressional district candidate and others to gear up for the fall elections state funded governors mansion to promote his idea of kentuckys future which includes sending union endorsed candidates like david boswell and do beshear and boswell realize that by aligning with the union bosses and partying with them on the back patio of the mansion they are actually supporting a measure the employee free choice act that would strip workers of their right to a private ballot vote check out how beshear and boswell plead for the labor bosses help time and money to ensure that unions have a stronger voice in congress
6090407 why are you shaking so nervously when were both girls
6090408 it was a breathtaking sight you didnt know what to say or where to start or what to do we didnt even know how to start so we started with the wine rack behind the bar and after that just started throwing stuff away
6090409 they lost their restaurant but on the positive side if we do this right their business will be better than ever
6090410 integration and regional linkage is the path for development which requires contribution and close cooperation by law making and enforcement bodies as well as the people
6090411 the georgians must be constantly alert because they can expect a stab in the back at any moment in 1997 people also believed that the kremlin was sincere when yeltsin and maskhadov signed a peace agreement and what happened next
6090412 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6090413 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6090414 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6090415 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6090416 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6090417 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6090418 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6090419 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6090420 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6090421 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6090422 who are open to doing something on the production side
6090423 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6090424 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6090425 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6090426 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6090427 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6090428 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6090429 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6090430 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6090431 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6090432 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6090433 creo que fue un descuido de ella porque la idea era hidratarse en todas las vueltas como estaba ubicada por el lado de adentro en la competencia era muy dific l cruzarse para buscar el l quido que necesitaba no pudo hidratarse ni en el primero ni en el segundo giro vamos tener que trabajar en este aspecto adem s le dieron varias patadas en la competencia pero es lo normal en este tipo de pruebas su problema no se debi a eso
6090434 fue un error m o de no utilizar los recursos que te sirven para el final ya que quedaba una sola vuelta
6090435 china is far away from the period when it has to prove its national strength with gold
6090436 this is a very good idea if she can get clean and still see blake it can only be good
6090437 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6090438 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6090439 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6090440 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6090441 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6090442 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6090443 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6090444 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6090445 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6090446 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6090447 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6090448 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6090449 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6090450 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6090451 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6090452 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6090453 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6090454 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6090455 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6090456 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6090457 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6090458 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6090459 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6090460 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6090461 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6090462 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6090463 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6090464 i had a big big weekend i got married to portia de rossi sorry john stamos this ones taken
6090465 my diet has a lot to do with getting in shape i have no sugar i dont even eat fruit because of the sugar i eat chicken salmon and rice i eat avocados ill have egg whites for breakfast and turkey burgers for lunch i try to do 1 200 calories a day it may not sound like much but its actually a lot if you eat the right things
6090466 if you do vigorous workouts plus this eating program it is possible to lose 12 pounds in 30 days in a healthy non fad like way
6090467 if a is a success in life then a equals x plus y plus z work is x y is play and z is keeping your mouth shut
6090468 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6090469 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6090470 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6090471 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6090472 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6090473 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6090474 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6090475 i want to have enough to pay the bills but im not really interested in it
6090476 you dont have to watch your investments every day all you have to do is know someone wholl watch for you its like you cant color your own hair you have to know a good colorist
6090477 when it comes to energy consumers are much more cost conscious
6090478 control or lack of it is a highly emotional value tied to a core american value the freedom of choice and should be leveraged in messaging
6090479 sin que exista alusi n alguna a posibles intervenciones de coadyuvantes
6090480 es evidente que no concurre la espec fica circunstancia que justifica la nica excepci n a la regla general sobre la intervenci n de coadyuvantes en los recursos de inconstitucionalidad pues los partidos pol ticos no se encuentran entre los sujetos legitimados por la constituci n y la lotc para intervenir activa o pasivamente

6090487 this is a tragedy anytime somebody dies anytime somebodys killed thats a tragedy but one has a right to act in self defense
6090488 he was traumatized and upset about what had happened and had been up all night long and he had several drinks
6090489 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6090490 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6090491 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6090492 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6090493 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6090494 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6090495 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6090496 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6090497 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6090498 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6090499 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6090500 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6090501 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6090502 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6090503 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6090504 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6090505 one of the illusions of life is that the present hour is not the critical decisive hour write it on your heart that every day is the best day of the year
6090506 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6090507 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6090508 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6090509 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
6090510 there is a dearth of shelters for women and many beds at coed facilities are unsafe
6090511 we need to stop digging our fiscal hole reform social security medicare and other entitlement programs to reflect americans longer life span and economic realities constrain other spending growth reform our tax system while generating more revenue engage in comprehensive health care reform increase national saving and elect responsible leaders

6090522 there has been a steady movement toward putting more data out there as weve been evolving and growing
6090523 people should stay tuned for that as we continue to update and upgrade the information we have on the site
6090524 we are deeply saddened that leroi moore saxophonist and founding member of dave matthews band died unexpectedly tuesday afternoon august 19 2008 at hollywood presbyterian medical center in los angeles from sudden complications stemming from his june atv accident on his farm near charlottesville virginia leroi had recently returned to his los angeles home to begin an intensive physical rehabilitation program
6090525 i feel negativity is not to be paid attention to
6090526 unless its something that happened with chris when it gets that serious its time to speak out
6090527 really my thing is i talked to the cats and its sad what people will do when theyre in the position of dont have
6090528 people will say omarion is still out there and in the pubic
6090529 i used to rock with them dudes and now when i see them its not like that
6090530 its gotta be like i look at you funny or you look at me funny if somebody has done something to disrespect you as a man i feel like i have to protect myself so now when i see them after everything that happened how do i be nice how do i be cool im a spiritual dude and a part of me is forgiving but there is so much that has been done you get tired of that this whole next album youll see a whole new omarion
6090531 a release is different from a drop when an artist is dropped usually they havent brought any revenue to the company as you know ive been with that company for a long time roughly over six years throughout b2k and my solo albums revenue was still brought in an artist like me could never get dropped how did i get dropped and i still ended up in a great situation usually when you hear drop it means oh hes over its a wrap its unfortunate that stuff like that gets put out there everybody likes to associate especially me being such a cool dude with negative things are you kidding me
6090532 hes a great producer and hes really at the top of his game right now
6090533 i cant ask for a better person to guide me we did ice box it wasnt enough for us to really build a solid relationship but ive got to spend time with him and we have a strong relationship its the biggest blessing that has happened to me musically
6090534 were just picking each others brains to see what can be done differently
6090535 my energetic style and aggressiveness when i perform i dont think thats necessarily been captured for the length of an album i always felt like i had joints like touch even entourage where its upbeat but it hasnt been captured in an album all these crazy new dances all these different things i wanna do when i look at my peers in the game they capture the true essence of who they are i kinda felt like throughout my career i had just blots of that
6090536 this is a unique business for the area and a great example of the creativity and ambition that exists in our young northerners
6090537 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6090538 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6090539 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6090540 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6090541 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6090542 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6090543 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6090544 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6090545 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

6090551 there was never any record kept of what went into the time capsule in 1903 or in 1966
6090552 so this discovery was a surprise this is part of our citys history there are many unique items including photographs that are now available to the public for the first time in 42 years when the time capsule is re sealed the digital copies will be the only copies we have of these
6090553 basically we were getting ready to go live and i saw something forming up in the sky
6090554 im surprised he didnt get hit by a car because we have a1a right here
6090555 i think it was a miracle that he just flew over the street and into the thing

6090558 it will have more than twice as much space for clinic activities
6090559 everybody in the lehigh valley deserves the opportunity to have a medical home where they can get preventive and primary care
6090560 how can we be this unhealthy when weve got such great health care in our backyard its because we dont have good public health infrastructure and we dont have good access to care

6090571 we are working incredibly hard to improve the energy efficiency of our data centers
6090572 we are not physically building our servers but there is very deep engagement with the computer makers
6090573 search was a very large portion of our demand in fiscal year 2008
6090574 going into this year it is still a very large proportion it is now not as dominant as it was last year
6090575 one of the big drivers for us that i see is the move to ip based delivery of rich video

6090590 hello mccain boy have i got something for you yeah so obamas younger brother is basically a hobo lives on a buck a year or something and obama doesnt do anything to help him merry christmas
6090591 its a movie that would definitely lend itself to seeing further adventures
6090592 lets do death race 2 i had a terrific time working with this group of people pauls terrific if they want to make another one then im in
6090593 we did the movie that is the beginning of roger cormans original death race 2000 the genesis of the death race that is portrayed in that 1975 film
6090594 if you watch this movie you can imagine how that would develop into what roger portrayed
6090595 but there are aspects to the first movie that we havent really addressed in this movie
6090596 for example in the first movie you run people down for points in this movie certainly lots of people get run down you just dont score points if we did do another movie i would like to address that if this develops into a franchise it would be slowly building towards what rogers movie was it feels like that movie actually takes place about 20 years after the events of this movie
6090597 i feel like its better not for us to dwell on that type of thing it could only go wrong
6090598 weve all been playing in bands for a very long time with little or no success depending on how you define that but the fact is that we went into this with only one ambition to have a good time and for us being able to still do that is really all thats important
6090599 we do like the thought of trying to be the best band in america
6090600 i mean who really knows who the best band is i dont thats for sure so for us striving to be really good at what we do and trying to have a good time thats the fun part everything else is just a little beyond us
6090601 on a good night we move more alcohol than most bands do in a week
6090602 when we first started out our audiences were maybe a little reflection of us you know people in their later 20s early 30s and predominately dudes guys who buy records and watch sports and a smattering of angry girlfriends
6090603 i think as the bands audience has grown weve actually expanded younger and there are a lot more girls coming to the shows and a lot of girls making their presence more upfront and thats just amazing
6090604 one of the coolest things i see now is fathers and sons coming to the show together
6090605 were kind of a classic rock band and people who grew up in the 70s and 80s even can probably relate to us as much as a 21 year old kid now theres also a really interesting sense of community with the fans theres a particular group called the unified scene who wear matching t shirts and form these bonds through the shows and i never thought wed see that
6090606 its really exciting to think about where this band has been and where were going
6090607 when we started we wanted to play a show and drink some beer and then last summer we opened for the rolling stones and played glastonbury and we opened for the stooges in croatia this band has really taken us around the world and its allowed all of us to see so much im pretty much amazed on a daily basis
6090608 i personally believe that us americans are unable to do so because some uh people out there in our nation uh dont have maps and our education like such as in south africa and uh the iraq everywhere like such as and i believe that they should our education over here in the us should help the us er should help south africa and should help the iraq and the asian countries so we will be able to build up our future for our children
6090609 we just heard a very big bang when we went outside we saw there was a young woman who looked like shed hurt her spine
6090610 the passenger of the truck looked like hed been injured as well
6090611 a tipper truck has caught the side of the bridge as it was passing underneath and there are two other vehicles a van and a car involved
6090612 we have recovery on the way but we expect this area will be closed for two hours
6090613 both the lorry driver and the car driver were taken to new cross hospital with what were believed to be minor injuries
6090614 my instincts took over and i told hannah to get in the back of the car with my son and i was just staring at this huge foot
6090615 the windscreen bowed but it was a miracle that it didnt break if it had shattered i think i would have been a gonner
6090616 i must have blacked out because all i can remember is the huge foot and then rangers at the park asking me if i was ok
6090617 she was boxed in by cars and was trying to turn around and had to scramble over this cars bonnet
6090618 obviously it is scary if you are not used to having a rhino climb on your car but she was not attacking them we had a similar incident about 10 years ago but thats it so twice in 35 years is not bad
6090619 top democratic party officials are expecting sen barack obama to select indiana sen evan bayh as his running mate as early as midweek

6090792 ive got to play well to have a chance of a wild card
6090793 im desperate to make it id love to im doing everything i can but whoever nick picks im sure it will be the best team
6090794 if i dont play well these two weeks id have no complaints if i dont get picked it would be totally acceptable the first tee of a ryder cup is not the place to be if youre not flying on all cylinders
6090795 i actually played ok there id be the first to say so if i was terrible but i wasnt
6090796 im doing everything i can but whoever nick picks im sure it will be the best team
6090797 if i dont play well these two weeks id have no complaints if i dont get picked it would be totally acceptable
6090798 the first tee of a ryder cup is not the place to be if youre not flying on all cylinders
6090799 at aproximately 4 30pm a structure collapsed and two men fell into the water
6090800 they were both wearing lifejackets and the life jackets automatically inflated when they fell into the water
6090801 the harbour authority emergency plan was put into operation and a boat on standby attended the men were rescued from the sea with the help of the seascapes ferry which was passing at the time
6090802 i would certainly like to commend brendan oneill the operator of the warrenpoint to omeath ferry mv seascapes
6090803 he happened to be in the right place at the right time and i think he certainly helped to avert a disaster thankfully the incident passed without anyone being seriously injured or any loss of life
6090804 brendan is a modest chap and i think the warrenpoint people will see him as a local hero
6090805 of course i am interested in the future of the club and in helping out if i can
6090806 i am very interested and prepared to listen to any approach
6090807 it is essential the deal went through in hurry because we needed the money
6090808 the directors agreed the transfer fee and manager alan mathews was not consulted
6090809 on much of broadway theres a lack of footfall nobody is living there and nobody is working there
6090810 it would give a kickstart to that part of town if you get 50 or 100 people off the housing list by turning empty offices into flats
6090811 its not as straightforward as it appears you have to balance the demand and supply to the type of affordable houses required
6090812 a life not lived on television and written about on the internet is not worth living
6090813 i know that some people were panicking a bit during the summer because sean odriscoll hadnt brought in a lot of new players after winning promotion but that was never the intention
6090814 had he done that it would have changed the complexion of the team and thats not the way to do it
6090815 the destruction of the islamic khilafah state over 80 years ago marked the beginning of dividing the muslim world into countless nation states governed by a plethora of kings dictators and western backed democrats today three major regions of the muslim world are under occupation palestine iraq and afghanistan oil and food crisis has pushed millions of people into starvation sectarian divisions are fuelled by occupying powers to further divide and weaken us the muslim ummah now needs a new political thinking and direction it requires a new leadership that will unify the umma and utilize her resources to address these countless problems this one day conference will address the obligation of unifying our umma under one leadership and discuss how political unity is the only practical way forward for the muslim ummah
6090816 how can it be that we have allowed our lands iraq afghanistan palestine kashmir chechnya our people our resources our wealth and our very dignity to be eaten up and destroyed by the enemies of islam when we have such great potential among us if only we unite as one umma
6090817 we are interested in collins john but we want to watch him in a reserve game first
6090818 it is a wear and tear injury and is a result of a career as an impact fast bowler
6090819 it the arthroscopy is just a service really and i am confident he will be fine in the long term
6090820 simon is a bit down he is sick to the back teeth with injury problems and he is disappointed not to reach some of the targets he has set himself such as 50 championship wickets this season
6090821 but he has done marvellously for us he has given our attack something it didnt have hes been an aggressive impact bowler and ive been delighted with him
6090822 attempt by the anti car fanatics to screw up our traffic on behalf of the bicycle fantasy

6090824 stephen is in our thoughts and i know that the community here will provide any support that stephens family need over this difficult time
6090825 both the carrickbawn estate and the newtown road were left flooded
6090826 they did tremendous work pumping water away they took several tankers of water and sewerage
6090827 if it had not been for their efforts and those of several statutory agencies and newry and mourne council it would have been a disaster
6090828 i am very critical of them they were nowhere to be seen in the midst of the chaos they didnt answer help lines numbers
6090829 they have been continually warned about the risk of rivers bursting their banks in the area and they insist on inaction and this is the result
6090830 usually it doesnt take so long to process this but since youre adopted it takes longer
6090831 the designs will be dramatic and it will have a lot of amenities and conveniences
6090832 honey im so sorry is there anything you can do get all of your friends emails home addresses and phone numbers so you can stay in contact with them i know how much they have ment to you
6090833 roads service and water service are just blaming each other
6090834 one blames it on the sewage line the other blames it on the drains while we get no answers and we need answers
6090835 my daughter is getting married at the end of the year and we want to redecorate the house but we cant because we if this happens again everything will be destroyed again
6090836 this is supposed to be our summertime so what will it be like in winter we need answers
6090837 only for the help of neighbours friends and fire crews we could have been in bigger trouble
6090838 we are very thankful because we were in a situation of despair as we were literally watching the bottom floor of our house being washed away
6090839 the floors the doors the skirting and everything at floor level has been destroyed
6090840 it took 18 months to do the house up and we only moved in three months ago
6090841 i have spent hours on the phone to water service and roads service but they just blame each other
6090842 tourists come to the hotel with all the necessary items to stay as if they were staying at the most extreme refuge on earth
6090843 this refuge will offer a mixed programme of reflection and exercise to seize the unique physical conditions encountered in space
6090844 will establish commercial flights into space toward our orbital hotels
6090845 so as far as leadership and patriotism goes i think its really important that those things have to take place and i think hes the best democratic candidate weve had since bill clinton and thats coming from a democrat
6090846 lame excuse get back in there and lick me out again
6090847 there were few remaining seeds because of the successive failed crops
6090848 what there was were all destroyed it was thought the original irish breed had been lost forever
6090849 it was an amazing sight seeing the sprout coming through the soil for the first time
6090850 i thought to myself these were the leaves that changed irish history
6090851 they have lovely blooms on them but they dont taste as nice
6090852 we dont eat them and we would never mass produce them we will just have a few each year to keep the tradition going
6090853 its tough it was close i thought i got him but i didnt

6090859 sometimes it takes getting to that point being in a homeless shelter
6090860 these people didnt even know me and they took me shopping for clothes good clothes not ames clothes they took me to jc penney so that i could go to work they took me to a very nice salon
6090861 thats important because my kids had a real hard time in the shelter they did not adjust well to it
6090862 to be a big family fun event to raise funds for the shelter so that we can continue to help as many people aspossible with no questions asked
6090863 and to raise awareness that people dont have to be afraid of a family homeless shelter
6090864 isso indica que eles aprendem um com os outros o que n o uma surpresa mas tamb m parece demonstrar que eles exibem elementos do que entre humanos chamar amos de um comportamento cultural

6090866 we want to work as a team and deal with our past in a transparent manner we have to utilise all talents available
6090867 i am happy to be back this is my country
6090868 looking back over the past six years i dare say that i have witnessed momentous change in kenya the people have been changing the kenyan landscape in fundamental ways
6090869 and this change must be captured in the countrys basic law i want to seize this opportunity to once again assure my fellow kenyans that i am fully committed to a new constitution
6090870 i have envisioned a free country where democracy thrives at all levels in all my political life i have endeavoured to create space for the full expression of our peoples creativity passion and vitality
6090871 i therefore view the conclusion of our countrys constitution making as a pivotal collective objective that will entrench the freedom and openness that has begun to define our homeland
6090872 the road to a new constitutional dispensation has been long and sometimes bumpy in the national constitutional review conference at bomas of kenya kenyans gave their views regarding the content of a new constitution unfortunately political differences derailed the consensus building process and the proposed constitution did not get full acceptance of the kenyan people
6090873 a framework of human rights integrity accountability and diligent performance of public duties is in place we are in the process of legislating on the issues of inter ethnic and race relations as well as truth justice and reconciliation
6090874 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now
6090875 conservatives were supposed to be the bigger problem for mccain
6090876 obama still has work to do on his base at this point mccain seems to be doing a better job with his
6090877 there were no wild swings there isnt one group that is radically different than last month or even two months ago it was just a steady decline for obama across the board

6090891 this is cool coming out of a mexican american background it feels good to represent the u s
6090892 not too many mexicans get the chance to do that
6090893 he has done an unbelievable job coming from the environment that he came from
6090894 could be in prison could be a drug runner could be this could be that hes done an unbelievable job of not being a victim
6090895 i was khary for a little minute but you guys got me
6090896 i dont think he shied away from anything i think itll take two to three games to get the instinct back but when the play comes right at him thats easy to read hes right on top of it and hes enjoying it
6090897 got in on some tackles so he had a big test for his knee
6090898 the sdd members were there to give information not to seek other peoples views
6090899 they had refused to meet sinn fein but talked to me as a representative of newry and mourne council
6090900 while the meeting discussed some of the issues this can in no way be seen as a substitute for dialogue
6090901 i will be going all out to get this parade stopped this year and every other year
6090902 these band parades have always been hugely contentious in newry with the closing down of a main road into the city
6090903 some councillors only attend meetings when it suits them when there is anything on the table that is controversial they are nowhere to be found
6090904 the cc gold coast builds upon the luxury sports coupe that debuted at the 2008 north american international auto show
6090905 weve added luxury and performance extras like tri coat paint high end interior appointments and ground affects that enhance the sportiness of our newest sedan
6090906 in the past number of months i have been giving serious consideration to my role on the council
6090907 i have been a councillor for several years now i have found representing fews constituents both a good experience and an interesting experience
6090908 it will be a wrench to leave my position but i will do what i feel is best for my area
6090909 it is not for me to say if he should resign one post or not
6090910 there has certainly been a lot of debate within parties on the issue
6090911 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6090912 this is a system that is defensive and is not aimed at anyone
6090913 this is an agreement that will establish a missile defence site that will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of a long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea
6090914 both sides have achieved their goals this is a great success for poland
6090915 adding a virtual security solution like reflex vsm to our technology portfolio offers our partners further opportunities to deliver complete virtualized data center solutions that are more secure and at a lower total cost of ownership
6090916 success i did it i won an olympic medal everybody on winning a silver medal i am completely happy and still in complete disbelief that i was able to achieve this feat im not joking its a tough loss but im on cloud nine i congratulated phelps and his coach bob bowman im just glad the race was fun to watch for everyone it was a pleasure for me really
6090917 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace

6090921 while the amount of vehicle crime across the division has gone down by 27 in the last year there has been a recent rise in thefts of number plates which has affected all areas
6090922 due to the recent increase in fuel prices we believe many of the stolen number plates are being attached to cars and used in petrol station drive offs
6090923 if drivers are caught using stolen plates they will be charged with handling stolen goods which is a serious criminal offence that will lead to a fine or imprisonment
6090924 if drivers are also using these plates to commit other offences or avoid paying car insurance road tax or congestion charges they are running the risk of severe penalties
6090925 while progress has been made there is no doubt that we need to move forward quickly
6090926 the political process has suffered major delays and is far from where it should be
6090927 i dont see that 2050 goal as very helpful since its so far away
6090928 a 2050 signal is okay but doesnt give us a real basis for agreeing
6090929 great land grab threat at u n climate talks in ghana
6090930 now we are talking and he seems to be in a great mood laughing and enjoy ing chatting with our negotiators
6090931 its kind of breaking the ice first before asking him to change his mind
6090932 what i am concerned about is whoever the individual sex offender is that we have in place the necessary provisions to monitor them
6090933 no paedophile is a celebrity every paedophile needs to be controlled
6090934 pretty hard to imagine it would be legitimate for him to travel abroad again
6090935 i think its right that we use police time to monitor sex offenders
6090936 if you are a british citizen you have the right to use the nhs whatever we think about an individual and this is a pretty despicable person
6090937 he glitter decides where he applies to go and the country or authorities there will decide whether they permit him to enter their territory
6090938 it makes you sick he doesnt even want to live here hes just coming to sponge off us i can think of a lot more worthy people to give treatment to on the nhs
6090939 hes an exploiter he exploits children hell exploit the nhs
6090940 get paul gadd back now and lets keep a careful eye on him allow the police to do their job

6090943 the chinese have rapidly built up supply chain capability and are likely to have nine gigawatts of manufacturing capacity in a few years
6090944 china is also likely to become a significant exporter of wind turbine equipment in a few years adding to its already strong presence in the solar industry
6090945 there is now a two year period of consultation and review before any of the proposals are implemented this will leave just ten years for the uk to establish a renewables infrastructure strong enough to meet its 2020 target
6090946 the uk is possibly being overly dependent upon its ability to translate ambitious targets into reality and needs to concentrate and improve its delivery track record if its position is not to decline further
6090947 strong contrast to the speed at which germany has addressed the challenges placed by the eu renewables directive
6090948 on the whole the credit crunch has not impacted upon the attractiveness of the sector
6090949 to make the uk a world leader in attracting investment in this sector and to avoid it slipping further down the index the government needs to consider creating tangible incentives for investors following the lead of germany and the ambition of china
6090950 the uk is still an attractive place to invest and renewables are a good long term investment a ten fold increase in renewable energy will bring on around 160 000 jobs and an estimated 100bn of investment from the private sector
6090951 lobby but perhaps that more apt descriptor was just a little too verbose for mrs press release

6090953 win or lose if we go out there and battle and play as hard as we did tonight well be happy with ourselves
6090954 obviously we want to win the game and we respect them greatly we go in as underdogs and if we go out there and give it a good go everyone will be proud of themselves
6090955 very scary because theyre the guys who you have posters of up on your wall
6090956 i expect its going to be chaotic in here today
6090957 this storm is going to be with us for a while thats obvious now it looks like it could be a boomerang storm
6090958 its very seldom were hoping for a hurricane but we are
6090959 i know people hate drought but when youre talking about a tropical cyclone relieving drought conditions be careful what you wish for
6090960 our biggest concern is complacency jacksonville has a history of being shielded from storm systems while we dont want anyone to panic we want everyone in the area to take this storm seriously
6090961 i just came in from the fields everything is burning up
6090962 if a storm is brewing down there just send it up i 26
6090963 their model is in line with companies like us we want to keep things as simple as possible and keep costs as low as possible
6090964 theyre in the phase where theyre getting big customers if they do well with the rollouts theyll get the attention of a lot of mainstream corporations
6090965 workday is like the ipod for enterprise hr software its a better and simpler way of doing things and people can see it
6090966 twenty customers does not a success make you have to be ready to put 10 years into this deal
6090967 egs enhanced geothermal systems could be the killer app of the energy world it has the potential to deliver vast quantities of power 24 7 and be captured nearly anywhere on the planet and it would be a perfect complement to intermittent sources like solar and wind
6090968 jo grandma never left the house without her make up so before they came to pick her up and take her to the funeral home i decided to fix her up for the ride
6090969 we dont want to condone people taking our intellectual property and using it without our permission
6090970 but we also dont like the idea of keeping fans of our products from being able to engage with our content for the most part people who are uploading videos are fans of our movies theyre not trying to be evil pirates and theyre not trying to get revenue from it
6090971 a youtube partner made a copyright claim on one of your videos
6090972 the beauty myth how images of beauty are used against women
6090973 we are grateful to zimbabwe cricket for confirming the decision taken by its officials during annual conference week
6090974 looking back at the season so far it feels like a different championship compared to last year as 2007 was very intense and consistency was incredibly important
6090975 this year everybodys results have been more varied and every driver who has won a race has also failed to score on at least two other occasions
6090976 thats made getting strong results even more important but i think well see consistency becoming crucial as we head towards the end of the season
6090977 but im wary of making predictions the race in hungary showed just how unpredictable formula one can be and thats one of the reasons why its such a fascinating sport
6090978 clearly i am still in a good position to challenge for the world championship and that remains my aim
6090979 we still feel confident about our chances we know our rivals will be strong but weve worked hard to improve the car and are confident well be competitive this weekend
6090980 the most important thing is to finish consistently in the points
6090981 i spend quite a lot of time between the races analysing the data and keeping fit
6090982 but the summer break gave me the opportunity to get away from that and focus on just recharging my batteries
6090983 weve done some preparation back at the mclaren technology centre ahead of this race
6090984 but our main focus will still be the three free practice sessions ahead of qualifying
6090985 ill be working closely with my engineers to make sure we start the weekend with a good baseline and work hard to strengthen it as we go through the weekend
6090986 it is a known fact that here many newspaper articles are written to order
6090987 real reporting existed for a few years in the early 90s it stopped as soon as journalists started dying because of it
6090988 i respect him and would be the first to complain if gorshkov got shut down
6090989 ive no regrets whatsoever with the decision i made to represent england
6090990 a year ago when it was being talked about there were mixed thoughts running through my mind
6090991 i though of jarrod cunningham a good mate of mine who i played with in new zealand and whose opinion i respected i knew what he went through
6090992 he was asked to play for england as well but turned it down and said he would never wear the rose
6090993 i thought about it knowing i didnt get the opportunity to play for new zealand at the highest level
6090994 to get the chance to play at the highest level and test myself against the best players in the world is fantastic
6090995 you do get the odd one or two text messages saying what are you up to but the people who mean a lot are really supportive
6090996 one opinion in particular that i respect is norm hewitts he sent a lovely e mail wishing me all the best and giving his blessing
6090997 he was a person i looked up to as a leader and a player when i first saw the e mail from him i thought oh heck he might say something about wearing the england jersey
6090998 but he told me to go and grab it with both hands and to do my best to get comments like that was a real boost
6090999 not once have i thought shucks what have i done im a kiwi i have no regrets whatsoever
6091000 im proud to wear my england training kit and hopefully ill get to pull on the jersey as well
6091001 if you look at the squad that went over there compared to this one its completely different
6091002 new management have come in there are new players around and some senior guys who have come back in to provide extra leadership
6091003 michael probably wont be fit and mark viduka certainly wont be
6091004 i probably could rush michael back and then knock him back five or six weeks
6091005 we are probably strong enough to do without the two of them but when they come back it will give us a massive boost
6091006 i hope there will be 20 more fedex cups for me but ive been looking forward to this ryder cup for a long time
6091007 i might not need to make one more euro but by coming here its in my hands
6091008 its certainly a situation where i would not feel comfortable sitting in the states but i am still in a very comfortable situation the other three are really sweating over it
6091009 i think theres enough experience there already the team is looking exceptionally strong
6091010 it was from 30 feet and i hit it way too hard and three putted
6091011 i was expecting it to be me soren and martin playing together but im really pleased
6091012 i love watching justin swing and we get on well
6091013 i would have taken this position at the start of the year but i should have had it tied up a long time ago
6091014 his horse is troubled with the lampas infected with the fashions full of windgalls sped with spavins
6091015 my diet has a lot to do with my getting into shape i have no sugar i dont eat fruit or even fruit juice because of the sugar i eat chicken and salmon and rice i eat avocados ill have egg whites for breakfast and sometimes turkey burgers for lunch i try to do just 1 200 calories a day it may sound like its not much but its actually a lot of food if you eat the right things
6091016 voters enthusiastically support chris gregoires common sense effective leadership and are eager for her to serve another term even after a well organized heavily funded attack effort against her governor gregoire triumphed in washingtons primary because she knows how to get results
6091017 the primary results confirm that voters understand full well the difference between governor gregoire and her republican opponent republican dino rossi cut health care for kids slashed education funding and voted against vital transportation funding for transit bridges and ferries the choice in november is clear an accomplished leader who delivers results for all of washington or a george bush republican who sides with special interests over everyday citizens
6091018 governor gregoire is working hard for working families and they will turn out for her in november in even greater numbers
6091019 only 38 per cent of the uks total water use comes from its own rivers lakes and groundwater reserves
6091020 the rest is taken from water bodies in many countries across the world to irrigate and process food and fibre crops that people in britain subsequently consume
6091021 whats particularly worrying is that huge amounts of these products are grown in drier areas of the world where water resources are either already stressed or very likely to become so in the near future
6091022 most people arent even aware that it takes massive amounts of water to grow the food and fibres we consume on top of what is used for drinking and washing and watering the lawn
6091023 therefore it is essential that business and government identify the areas that could potentially suffer water crises and develop solutions so the environment is not overexploited to the point that people and wildlife lose out
6091024 the private sector has a very important role to play it can engage with governments and communities along its supply chain to support better water management
6091025 in order to reduce risk businesses need to do their utmost to encourage more efficient and effective water use in water stressed areas where they operate
6091026 this is not just an issue for food and clothing companies producers and retailers insurers and investors have a vested interest in encouraging efficiency of water use and security of water supply in an ever thirstier world water is irreplaceable and climate change and population growth are only going to exacerbate the problem
6091027 the lhc is a discovery machine we dont know what well find
6091028 im actually hoping we find something unexpected that does the job of the higgs
6091029 weve been debating this for 30 years and one way or another the lhc will definitively tell us how electroweak symmetry breaking occurs thats a fundamental advance
6091030 its a tough game you can only do it by statistical analysis since there are other known processes that produce events that can mimic a higgs boson signal
6091031 by itself the higgs is a very puzzling particle so there have been a lot of conjectures about some kind of new physics beyond the standard model supersymmetry has the easiest time fitting in with what we know
6091032 initially well be looking for things that are known standards to make sure that everything is working properly in 2009 we could start really looking for new things like supersymmetry
6091033 these large projects take such a long time we have to start early
6091034 weve been operating it and looking at cosmic ray particles
6091035 nature gives us these cosmic rays for free and theyre the same kinds of particles well see when the machine turns on so it enables us to check out certain aspects of the detector but were very excited to start seeing collisions from the machine
6091036 well be throwing away a lot of data so we have to make sure the triggers are working correctly
6091037 the graduate students and postdocs get to go to geneva but even the undergraduates get a chance to work in a real physics lab and be part of a major international experiment
6091038 there is a high level of interaction and camaraderie between theorists and experimentalists at ucsc which is not the case at other leading institutions
6091039 for me its valuable just in terms of being aware of whats happening on the experimental side
6091040 if nothing were found beyond what we know today that would be so radical because it would be in violation of a lot of extremely fundamental principles
6091041 we may wind up airing some of it on cnbc or maybe the usa network and then cut away to something else
6091042 were basically going to treat it like the hammer throw
6091043 all over the world governments and political parties left right and center have lost credibility we dont believe they can eliminate poverty save the environment stop the violence or advance the cause of human rights
6091044 the farmers you kill are your own brothers and sisters when you hear words of a man telling you to kill remember instead the words of god thou shalt not kill gods law must prevail no soldier is obliged to obey an order contrary to the law of god
6091045 per favore fammi salire sulla tua schiena e portami sullaltra sponda

6091047 we are pleased with the councils approval of the grouper ifq program if implemented it will provide needed changes for the grouper fishing industry by ensuring sustainable fishing practices and a return to profitability its a win win solution for fishermen regulators and the environment
6091048 after two years of hard work on this program by fishermen and many other interests we feel that this program captures the needs of fishermen while accomplishing the councils goals to protect the fishery the council made the right decision in moving this program forward so that fishermen can have their vote we believe it will receive overwhelming support in commercial fishing communities throughout the gulf of mexico
6091049 the facts are clear and unfortunately its becoming more and more obvious the status quo is not working america is not a sexually healthy nation for this to change we must acknowledge this reality and embrace the important role condoms play in maintaining ones sexual health
6091050 by drawing attention to this issue on such a grand political and social stage were hoping to give renewed voice and attention to the simple fact that condoms play a critical part in advancing the sexual health of america

6091052 the combination of the immensely productive cold humboldt current offshore and the dry climate onshore created conditions whereby perus coastal islands hosted vast colonies of seabirds whose droppings were preserved in layers tens of metres deep
6091053 a major international fundraising initiative will be needed both to protect the islands until a sustainable longer term plan is developed as well as to create and underpin this plan
6091054 an urgent priority for the conservation of peruvian terns is to protect the largest known breeding site within the paracas reserve from disturbance by tourists and vehicles
6091055 for all species effective site protection and management are needed the workshop identified about 40 sites which need to be properly safeguarded if the great spectacles of peruvian seabirds are to survive
6091056 father rapidly pushed us towards the car and we moved off from then i do not remember anything
6091057 i came out and started screaming and calling out to the neighbors to help me i was almost sure that i would never see my husband and children alive
6091058 soon my husbands car appeared and that was like a miracle to me then military helicopters appeared above our village and shelling began in our place too so we fled to tbilisi
6091059 i want to serve as an example for my younger sisters who still cannot sleep at night
6091060 no matter that our house is looted burned or destroyed we still want to be back home
6091061 now i realize how good it is to be alive we do not ask for any help but we urge for peace that will give us a chance to build our lives again
6091062 the potential role of arsenic in diabetes development is supported by experimental and mechanistic evidence
6091063 from a public health perspective confirmation of a role for arsenic in diabetes development would add to the concerns posed by the carcinogenic cardiovascular developmental and reproductive effects of inorganic arsenic in drinking water and could substantially modify risk assessment and risk benefit analyses estimating the consequences of arsenic exposure
6091064 given widespread exposure to inorganic arsenic from drinking water worldwide elucidating the contribution of arsenic to the diabetes epidemic is a public health research priority with potential implications for the prevention and control of diabetes
6091065 stemming the pandemic of type 2 diabetes is a public health priority and will require a multifaceted approach
6091066 this must include improving the understanding of the etiology of diabetes and identifying modifiable factors that can be incorporated into prevention strategies
6091067 to date this approach has focused on medication and lifestyle modification but the role of environmental exposures must also be considered
6091068 while many questions remain about the role of arsenic in diabetogenesis they can only be answered by additional research
6091069 in the meantime arsenic exposure from drinking water is a widespread environmental pollutant that affects millions of individuals around the world
6091070 it is prudent to minimize arsenic exposure while its effect on metabolic diseases continues to be researched
6091071 this reminds me of the shepherds way fire in february 2005 in which hundreds of sheep were killed where no arrests were made in the arson
6091072 i wonder if there is any potential relation between the fires second why were they keeping 6 500 pigs in one barn that sounds like a pretty intensive operation that raises its own concerns about humaneness
6091073 the town currently has no protection against large extractions at the regional or state level

6091093 i think it would cause more problems for us i think a lot of people now choose not to drink because its against the law wed just have a lot more problems if more students were drinking
6091094 i signed the statement in hopes that it would encourage debate on our campus about the seriousness of drinking in general but more importantly the high risk drinking that has become so common on college campuses today
6091095 do they remember what happened the last time the age was lowered we drove the drinking problems farther down to the younger ages
6091096 this is the colleges saying that by making it legal we dont have to worry about it rather than dealing with the problems
6091097 you can wipe out the illegality overnight but not the problems
6091098 the best argument is that if theyre old enough to fight a war theyre old enough to drink i understand that thats a social justice issue
6091099 my concern is they havent lived on their own and havent faced decisions that after a couple of years in college they can better deal with
6091100 these are very young people they are adults but theyre very young adults
6091101 i cant imagine the added problems by having so many more students legally drinking
6091102 we need serious sustained unfettered debate about the drinking age and the reality of life on a college campus and how these two things are aligned
6091103 we must engage in civil informed and dispassionate debate and consider all policy alternatives no matter how controversial

6091153 we have never stopped people from exiting to any country of their choice to get their visas changed or renewed
6091154 if he goes to a neighbouring country what will happen to him if the visa gets delayed and the employer does not send the visa it is to avoid such situations we are encouraging people to go to their home countries
6091155 again we will consider it on a case by case basis we do let people change their visa status without exiting the country in order to help them avoid difficulties
6091156 if anybody gets a job and applies for an employment visa we will study the case and then decide whether to approve his application or not
6091157 today alone we issued 150 policies by 12pm people are also finding it easy because they can buy insurance over the counter within dnrd

6091161 john mccains tax plan for big corporations two hundred billion in new tax breaks
6091162 yes it is okay to publicly say that it is not possible for this man to be a flawless messiah and that maybe we are being deceived by our desire to have one secondly we dont know of anything substantive this man has achieved so what can we really expect so lets get back to the issues and the policies necessary to prevail on them
6091163 over the last week weve seen sen obamas lead in the poll of polls cut in half
6091164 this change was likely driven by a renewed focus on foreign policy after russias invasion of georgia as well as by sen mccains willingness to launch more aggressive attacks against obama on issues such as off shore drilling
6091165 the big question now is whether obama can successfully regain control of the campaign agenda as we head into the democratic convention
6091166 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now
6091167 that hairline difference between nuance and what appears to be flip flopping is hurting him with liberal voters
6091168 conservatives were supposed to be the bigger problem for mccain
6091169 obama still has work to do on his base at this point mccain seems to be doing a better job with his
6091170 there were no wild swings there isnt one group that is radically different than last month or even two months ago it was just a steady decline for obama across the board
6091171 this kind of behavior should not be acceptable from a teacher you should be tolerant but not stupid

6091174 these women are the most unprivileged part of the society and have no social or legal recognition of their work
6091175 in this process these organisations established 11 cooperatives in sindh and punjab to build their capacity and provided them with basic health facilities
6091176 the union will be formally launched at a national congress in lahore in which more than 500 home based workers will participate and later in islamabad in the first week of september
6091177 all cooperative members as well as other home based workers from districts have already formed their 20 25 member primary associations

6091183 we are in a 53 trillion hole and that hole gets deeper 2 3 trillion a year automatically even if you have a balanced budget
6091184 honestly since the budget controls expired on december 2002 i think washington has been totally out of control
6091185 its not todays deficits and debt levels that are the problem its where were headed
6091186 the problem is that were heading in a wrong direction when the baby boom generation starts retiring that will bring a tsunami of spending that we are not prepared for
6091187 i think the federal government is doing an extremely poor job of managing its finances and unfortunately too many americans have been following this bad example spending more money than they make and mortgaging their future
6091188 there has to be a behavioral change americans are very prolific at spending and not very good at saving and thats caused us to increasingly rely on foreign lenders to finance our deficits
6091189 thats not in our long term economic or geopolitical interests

6091202 well did he drop off the 200 bucks he owes me
6091203 well that isnt entirely correct because sometimes its gray and cloudy
6091204 if grass doesnt get enough water it turns brown so that isnt really correct either
6091205 no but that isnt really a question you want to ask in class discussion
6091206 i dreamt they were auctioning off dicks the big ones went for ten dollars and the thick ones went for twenty dollars
6091207 i had a dream too i dreamt they were auctioning off cunts the pretty ones went for a thousand dollars and the little tight ones went for two thousand
6091208 im sorry your ladyship this man has a very serious condition where the testicles rapidly fill with semen if he doesnt do that five times a day they would explode and he would most likely die instantly

6091259 often referred to as intrinsically safe lights fluorescent lights are popular in paint spray booths because fluorescent lights provide even lighting and more consistent true color
6091260 while our explosion proof fluorescent lights continue to be popular with oil rigs and aerospace companies as surface mount lights we have seen more and more paint booth operators working to bring their shops compliant with osha requirements we offer explosion proof fluorescent lights that can be mounted on the ceiling or on carts with wheels in this way the operators can either work with overhead lighting or position these hazardous location fluorescent lights to illuminate specific portions of the painted pieces
6091261 we think we offer one of the best values in the industry our explosion proof paint spray booth lights are certified to ul 844 for hazardous locations ul 595 and 1598 as waterproof lights for marine and saltwater applications and ul 924 which covers the use of these intrinsically safe lights as emergency lights we have recently added a second ballast to our existing fluorescent fixtures that enables them to operate not only as a work area light in the paint spray booth but also offer 90 minutes of emergency lighting in the event of power loss our explosion proof fluorescent light offers dual duty as a functional work light and an explosion proof emergency light saving the paint spray booth operator or the oilfield operator money both in fixtures and installation costs while meeting all the osha requirements for hazardous location lighting to top it off we offer these fixtures made right here in texas under 1000 each and usually with less than 2 weeks lead time
6091262 we really have worked to become a one stop shop for plant maintenance workers oil field operators paint spray booth operators and shipyards who need a variety of explosion proof surface mount and portable lighting
6091263 durant la p riode de transition faisant suite la finalisation des rectifications comptables
6091264 nous voyons une excellente croissance linternational et sur les march s mergents en particulier
6091265 productivitys up gdps up but are your wages didnt think so the economic policy institutes 11th state of working america 2008 2009 elucidates the thankless hard work of our middle class theyve grown the u s economy over the last seven years but are left with nothing to show for it in their wallets a snippet of the report has been posted check back for more by labor day and for the complete report by january 2009
6091266 though we welcome the recent gains in the market we caution that the selling pressure has not diminished
6091267 in fact we have actually seen selling pressure increase in the face of new demand this worries us because most bull markets usually start from the opposite situation
6091268 we anticipate that the buyers will eventually wear out and the remaining strength in selling will drive the market lower
6091269 as far as we can tell the current market upturn looks like a typical temporary buying episode in a bear market so do not be misled we have not yet had the cathartic selling episode that normally signals a bottom
6091270 slower growth and higher unemployment will dominate the headlines in the next few months the economic factors will be a drag on the stock market until investors correctly anticipate the inevitable recovery
6091271 overall this is a good time to be patient we do not need to chase what we think is a short term rally in order to catch up with the market we know there will be better buying opportunities ahead particularly for u s stocks and are waiting for those opportunities
6091272 we are however finding select opportunities among stocks one sector that was doing very well until early may of this year was the packaging and container companies since then many have fallen 20 30
6091273 at the same time their businesses have remained very robust and the fundamentals continue to improve we believe these stocks are very cheap
6091274 there is not a specific exchange traded fund or mutual fund for the group therefore we re buying the biggest and the cheapest one of the group owens illinois
6091275 owens illinois manufactures plastic and glass packaging products this includes glass bottles plastic containers and closures plastic prescription containers labels and multipack plastic carriers for beverage bottles
6091276 weve looked at several ways to play anticipated growth in wind energy weve also considered titanium makers for that industrys ties to the production of lightweight modern aircraft
6091277 while the two trends might not appear to have much in common at first glance hxl offers a way to play both the aircraft and wind markets
6091278 the connection is the lightweight composite materials hexcel makes that are used by producers in both sectors hexcel develops and manufactures advanced structural materials
6091279 it is the largest u s producer of carbon fiber the world s largest weaver of reinforcement fabrics and the number one producer of composite materials
6091280 its product was initially developed for the aerospace industry but is now used in a wide range of applications from golf clubs to satellite arrays and from the rotor blades of wind turbines to life saving monocoques for formula 1 race cars
6091281 its been a rollercoaster ride for hexcels stock in the past 12 months the shares hit their one year peak of 27 19 in december 2007 by january 22nd they had plummeted to 17 the shares rebounded through may only to fade again year to date hxl is off about 15
6091282 second quarter profits came in shy of wall streets expectations as a result of costs associated with the start up of four overseas manufacturing plants and a weak u s dollar the reason hexcel has been investing in plants in europe is to be closer to customers such as airbus
6091283 hexcel just won a big order from airbus that was the biggest in the companys history
6091284 hexcel is in a great position to profit from the growing investment in wind energy platforms and the demand for lighter weight more fuel efficient airplanes the skyrocketing price of crude during q2 did much to disrupt the plans of cash strapped airlines to acquire the new planes
6091285 boeings delays getting the dreamliner in the air have also been well documented those are short term problems however long term it is inevitable that air carriers will want these newer planes in their fleets
6091286 wind energy is obviously a hot topic too oilman boone pickens is pushing wind farms as an alternative to oil fired power plants al gores alliance for climate protection meanwhile has promoted them as an anecdote to greenhouse gas emissions
6091287 when two guys like gore and pickens coming from opposite ends of the political spectrum can come to the same view theres some karma happening
6091288 its been causing pain and inflammation for some time and i just need to have it cleared up so i can get back on the floor sooner rather than later

6091297 we realized there was such interest and excitement in these categories to do with height that it was too important a category for us to leave it to a doctor alone

6091371 this advance can largely be explained by the 4 2 per cent increase in sales at gasoline stations mainly as a result of higher gas prices in june

6091382 thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
6091383 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting

6091421 one of the traditions of yachting has always been the opportunity to thank business partners close new business deals and simply enjoy the beauty of the ocean and islands that dot our landscape
6091422 while this tradition continues were experiencing a new day and age where the global climate requires increased caution and awareness
6091423 given the uncertain climate of todays world yacht and private aircraft owners need the guidance and expertise of those who thoroughly understand the complicated dynamics of optimum security and protection for these specific industries
6091424 as the current market stands most yacht owners are relying on antiquated security alarm systems installed on the yachts or planes or they hire management consulting firms that provide basic yet sometimes superficial security assessment and advice
6091425 theres a dire need for professional guidance from people who are well versed in all the many nuances of security and protection for the yacht and aviation industries
6091426 companies that have specialized in home and or personal security are now ineffectively branching out to cover the marine and aviation industries
6091427 however retaining a company like that would be like going to the family doctor when you need a brain surgeon
6091428 its impossible to underestimate the value of a highly trained discrete well screened and proven security team and crew for your luxury yacht or aircraft
6091429 all ocean going ships over 300 gross tons are required under the international safety of life at sea solas to carry an approved class a ais transponder as an aid to collision avoidance and to facilitate vessel traffic monitoring by shore based control centers
6091430 with the advent of the class b ais standard recently adopted by the international maritime organization smaller vessels not subject to the solas carriage requirements can also take advantage of the benefits provided by ais technology
6091431 the r4b can improve situational awareness for operators of smaller commercial and recreational craft by providing an automatic data exchange between ais equipped vessels giving each of them a clear picture of the other vessels position and movements
6091432 it is also the quality choice for low cost ais tracking applications
6091433 there are so many reasons this boat makes sense in todays environment
6091434 at a time with record high oil prices we are bringing to market a product that will dramatically reduce the most visible expense of a recreational motor boat the cost of diesel the dses efficiency will make all the difference in the world when compared to other luxury yachts plus shes ready for alternative fuels the dses steyr monoblock engine runs equally well on bio diesel
6091435 our goal from the initial concept stages two years ago was to deliver six knots on solar energy alone
6091436 sea trials earlier this year proved it can be done we feel the dse represents a real breakthrough opening the door to a new era of environmentally friendly and efficient cruising yachts
6091437 our results conclusively prove there is a causal relationship between immunization schedules and diabetes
6091438 the recent data shows that common childhood vaccines are especially dangerous to children with a strong family history of diabetes
6091439 parents of a child with a strong family history of insulin dependent diabetes should know that the administration of a full series of vaccines may have a greater than 5 percent chance of causing their child to develop diabetes

6091448 i actually had the pleasure of directing traffic at the end of the year
6091449 we sent out notices including blaming the parents for the problem and i dont know what else to do
6091450 i feel like we have one shot at the apple this year and i want to get it right
6091451 i certainly stand by the idea that we have to do something
6091452 give us the first month of the school year to get some data to work with
6091453 i applaud dr yokel and his research team for earning such a prestigious award
6091454 it is an honor that the epa star program selected uk for the largest single grant it has ever awarded for nanotechnology research this award is a perfect example of why it is so important that kentucky has a world class research university as it shows that the leading faculty and researchers that we have been able to recruit and retain here at uk are among the best in the world
6091455 our research will study the structural and chemical properties of manufactured nanoscale materials being developed here at uk and elsewhere to identify the properties that influence their distribution in the body particularly the brain
6091456 one of us is here almost all the time and we make a point to have one of us in the dining room so were visible i think its still a novelty for customers to come into a restaurant and actually see the owner greeting you and working in the dining room
6091457 theres no reason when the owner is there that you should ever leave the restaurant dissatisfied
6091458 plus were consistent we have almost no employee turnover and all of our key employees have been here for 10 or more years that leads to consistency of service
6091459 i did very well athletically at northeastern but not so well academically
6091460 but ray did and he taught me how to make them
6091461 unfortunately after i bought him out he opened another doughnut shop around the corner and took the business with him so i was left here with a doughnut shop and no business i spent the next three years cultivating a business during the night i made the doughnuts and during the day i cultivated the business by spending a lot of time with the public
6091462 we used to have a lot of guys come in from the department including a guy named romeo defazio
6091463 he used to say to me why dont you sell breakfast and i said i would but i dont know how to cook eggs so he came in one day with a dozen eggs and a pound of bacon and showed me how to cook eggs
6091464 after romeo taught me how to make eggs i woke up one morning and said you know im making doughnuts im working nights im killing myself i make more money on an order of eggs than a dozen doughnuts maybe i should sell eggs so i started to sell eggs and that took off eventually the eggs won out
6091465 when we made blts the mailman used to come in for lunch and he wanted something light so he said instead of making a blt why dont you take a little bit of that lettuce tomato and bacon and make a salad so we said ok and we made a little salad
6091466 the other customers saw the mailman eating the salad and said lets have a salad like the mailman eventually it became known as the mailman salad and its still on the menu though now it has different variations
6091467 when i started to sell food i opened up part of the back where we made the doughnuts i needed some tables and chairs there was a laundromat down the street that went out of business and it had tables where people folded their laundry i got those tables and put them in the back of the restaurant and thats where the people sat when they came in for lunch
6091468 he knew how to fry clams and french fries and he talked me into putting in a fryolator
6091469 so now we had french fries and on fridays we would run a special with fried clams then we started to build a lunch business
6091470 we continued to grow and eventually stopped making doughnuts and got serious about breakfast and lunch then i decided to try to open nights too on friday and saturday nights wed be open until 1 or 2 a m to get the movie crowd but we found after awhile that wasnt profitable and we stopped that we did stay open nights during the week but we were really struggling to make ends meet
6091471 i hired him for a month to come in and analyze my business and teach me how to do food buying and train my employees
6091472 i hired the student to analyze my business too i wish i could remember her name she did a complete hour by hour study and told me i was making money up until 2 30 p m from 2 30 to 9 p m i was losing money so a month later i started closing nights and staying open until 2 30 p m i had been behind in my bills 90 days in three months time i was current with all my bills it was really an eye opening experience and thats how we survived in those days
6091473 another reason i used to play tennis on friday afternoon at the natick racquet club with a bunch of guys but we had no place to eat after tennis so i stayed open so the guys could come here and eat
6091474 once dunkin donuts got popular we couldnt compete with them
6091475 besides people werent coming here for doughnuts they were coming here for bacon and eggs
6091476 we demolished the whole place and were closed for two months
6091477 i think we saved one piece of equipment at the time we were 30 years old and the place looked tired and nothing worked the air conditioning didnt work the dishwasher didnt work water was dripping from the ceiling the booths were torn and ripped yet the day before we closed was probably one of the busiest days we ever had and the place was falling apart and we were closing for two months i said what the hell are we doing but it had to be done
6091478 there was a hail and rainstorm in the middle of winter and the place was still jammed
6091479 the customers came in and just sat at the counter it was unbelievable
6091480 we take breakfast to the next level with very creative items
6091481 wayland became a more upscale community and we grew with it
6091482 rather than stay what we were we listened to our customers and tried to give them what they wanted
6091483 we cook to order we cook fresh chain comes out with sandwiches that are all pre made and put into a microwave oven
6091484 theres a girl i went to school with who just came in with her grandchildren
6091485 we had 50th birthday parties here and when we turned 65 we had a medicare party this place is so special because mel is one of the nicest guys we know
6091486 a community drop in center first come the day workers then the white shirt guys then the tennis women then the seniors its a wonderful melange weve met people here we wouldnt have known otherwise the food also happens to be very good
6091487 in the early days every once and awhile mel let me flip the doughnuts with a wooden stick so i felt special
6091488 ive eaten more breakfasts here than i have anywhere else in my life
6091489 i was here on a sunday morning and im cruising around the tables and checking out people seeing who i know
6091490 im walking through the restaurant and this woman calls me over to her table
6091491 but this summer i really got a taste of what its like to play alongside those women i felt i was on the brink is it olympics realistic maybe but there are so many more steps you have to take
6091492 it was amazing playing with the olympic girls ive been watching on tv
6091493 i was so thrilled to score and get a hug from someone on the national team it was surreal i was like in the presence of royalty
6091494 the biggest thing is experience as a freshman i was honored to play as much as i did but i knew i was far away from where i needed to be
6091495 i dont care how old i am im hoping to be a leader and a role model

6091497 gt iranian star golshifteh farahani makes u s debut in
6091498 adventus is the exact christian latin equivalent of the greek
6091499 the central doctrine of christianity then is not that god is a bastard
6091500 always thinks it has a great soul and vast views beyond the comprehension of the weak and that it is doing gods service when it is violating all his laws
6091501 modern man lacks the humility to accept the fact that the whole drama of history is enacted in a frame of meaning too large for human comprehension or management
6091502 has a visible direction set by liberty and the author of liberty
6091503 americas vital interests and our deepest beliefs are now one
6091504 we go forward with complete confidence in the eventual triumph of freedom
6091505 all men are naturally inclined to obscure the morally ambiguous element in their political cause by investing it with religious sanctity
6091506 this is why religion is more frequently a source of confusion than of light in the political realm
6091507 the tendency to equate our political with our christian convictions causes politics to generate idolatry
6091508 no one sings odes to liberty as the final end of life with greater fervor than americans
6091509 the occupant of the white house has become a combination of demigod father figure and inevitably the betrayer of inflated hopes pope pop star scold scapegoat crisis manager commander in chief agenda settler moral philosopher interpreter of the nations charisma object of veneration and the butt of jokes all rolled into one
6091510 sometimes tempts minds whose primary preoccupation is the military defense of a nation and who think it might be prudent to pick the most propitious moment for the start of what they regard as inevitable hostilities but the rest of us must resist such ideas with every moral resource
6091511 including the probable so long as war has not broken out we still have the possibility of avoiding it those who think that there is little difference between a cold and a hot war are either knaves or fools

6091515 prom queen is the perfect demonstration of what we can do at vmtv using the power of the living brand and virgin medias multiple platforms to create hits on every screen
6091516 in using a coordinated campaign there is the opportunity for greater impact this means that not only do people see the same campaign everywhere they go but also that the political powers receive a coherent message as well as the media
6091517 our message is therefore easier to broadcast because it echoes everywhere and in everyone

6091521 there are no two opinions about the need to switch over to other modes of power generation like nuclear energy and hydro coal based power production has to be restricted
6091522 coal based power generation is not a feasible proposition coal stocks are limited and might not be there always to generate power at such a large scale
6091523 from april 2007 to january 2008 around 255 million tonnes of coal was supplied to power utilities against the annual action plan target of 249 97 million tonnes
6091524 the situation is grim and unless fast track measures are undertaken by the ministry of coal and coal companies the ntpc stations face serious threat of taking units out of bar
6091525 which is why we have advised the ministry of power to retain the target of importing 20 million tonnes of coal for power plants in 2008 09 it will help them build up coal stocks at power houses
6091526 a long term solution to meet increasing electricity needs lies in switching over to hydro and other renewable modes for generating energy
6091527 the flora and fauna around us are shifting over time due to climate change
6091528 the result is desynchronisation if birds and the insects on which they depend do not react in the same way we are headed for an upheaval in the interaction between species
6091529 at any one site the community of birds you find there has changed over time
6091530 now more of the species that are found in warmer climates are occurring but that change is not occurring as fast as the change in temperature is
6091531 some species have changed their range hugely over the past two decades
6091532 for example the buzzard one of our biggest birds of prey 20 years ago was restricted to the west of britain but has now spread as far east as london
6091533 geothermal energy which is sometimes known as hot rocks has got a huge potential for australia both as a solution to climate change and in terms of national energy security
6091534 one percent of reserves would produce 26 000 years of energy supplies
6091535 the upper cost boundary will decline over time because the level of uncertainty is expected to narrow as the industry grows this cost is expected to be lowest cost of any form of renewable or low emissions energy
6091536 we could now see australias first commercially viable geothermal power plants in place within four to five years
6091537 geothermal energy provides clean base load power and is potentially a very important contributor to australias energy mix in a carbon constrained world

6091553 if we think that we can secure our country by just talking tough without acting tough and smart then we will misunderstand this moment and miss its opportunities
6091554 americans across our country are hurting because of the cost of energy
6091555 gas prices are through the roof energy costs have seeped into our grocery bills making it more expensive to feed our families and now as people prepare for the winter they are going to be hit with higher costs for home heating oil
6091556 he has said it will not solve our problem and that its not real
6091557 if we think that we can use the same partisan politics where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
6091558 the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
6091559 i will let no one question my love of this country i love america so do you and so does john mccain when i look out at this audience i see people of different political views you are democrats and republicans and independents but you all served together and fought together and bled together under the same proud flag you did not serve a red america or a blue america you served the united states of america

6091563 operations in the second quarter are actually slightly worse than i had expected even if the dry cargo market has been record strong in the second quarter they havent profited as much as i had hoped
6091564 and the majority of the outlook upgrade they delivered is related to accounting practices in connection with the rise in oil prices
6091565 the profit was achieved in volatile markets in both the dry cargo and tanker segments
6091566 the first quarter was influenced by a substantial adjustment in the very strong dry cargo market and a weak winter tanker market
6091567 on the other hand the second quarter was favourable for both the dry cargo and tanker segments
6091568 in line with the strategy of adjusting capacity to market conditions norden reduced the bulk carrier fleet in the beginning of the half year particularly of panamax vessels on short term charter
6091569 when the dry cargo market started to rise the company restored the fleet capacity to gain advantage of the favourable market
6091570 the position of the government is very clear we will not support nuclear power in australia because we dont need to mr fergusonsaid toabc radio
6091571 as a person who actually encouraged the development of our uranium mining industry i understand the importance of nuclear power beyond australia
6091572 but unlike australia a lot of those countries are not energy rich
6091573 for example just1 per cent of australias geothermal energy could equate to 26 000 times australias total energy consumption at any one time
6091574 so from the australian governments point of view encouragement of geothermal activity is exceptionally important
6091575 i would have thought that given our renewable energy target of 20 per cent by 2020 we could see a significant contribution of that 20 per cent from the geothermal industry

6091585 i really love to engage youth in intelligent conversations about values ideals and goals many of the questions in the kubit2me games get these ideas out in the open
6091586 as a working mother of preteen and teenage boys its a challenge to find the time to have meaningful conversations with my kids and more of a challenge to get them to open up
6091587 when we played kubit2me now youre talkin we all really listened to each other not only did we have a blast playing this game but we also learned some interesting things about each other

6091590 our relationship with india in the same manner is not counterproductive to pakistan it is between afghanistan and india india is one of the great economic powers
6091591 india provided a good educational environment for afghans i was one of them and there are a thousand more like me in india now afghanistan wants this relationship and we hope that pakistan evolves into a good relationship with india as well we have clarity about our objectives our way forward and about what we want to lead into the future this cannot be undermined by bombs
6091592 i hope he pakistani army chief gen ashfaq p kiyani recognises that what they are doing in terms of supporting militancy in afghanistan is causing immense damage to pakistan itself

6091618 investeringsmaatschappijen kennen alleen de logica van het rendement niet de logica van het bedienen van klanten
6091619 van de bedrijven die door private equity worden overgenomen gaat 15 procent binnen tien tot vijftien jaar failliet normaal gesproken ligt dit percentage op 4 procent
6091620 dat wreekt zich pas na een langere periode van meer dan vijf jaar uitendelijk verliezen bedrijven hierdoor meestal klanten omdat ze niet innovatief genoeg meer zijn
6091621 bij investeringen in nieuwe diensten wordt soms extra gediscussieerd of ze uiteindelijk voldoende opleveren
6091622 als het rentepercentage stijgt en de inkomsten vallen wat tegen raakt het bedrijf al snel in moeilijkheden

6091660 ive no regrets whatsoever with the decision i made to represent england
6091661 a year ago when it was being talked about there were mixed thoughts running through my mind
6091662 i though of jarrod cunningham a good mate of mine who i played with in new zealand and whose opinion i respected i knew what he went through
6091663 he was asked to play for england as well but turned it down and said he would never wear the rose
6091664 i thought about it knowing i didnt get the opportunity to play for new zealand at the highest level
6091665 to get the chance to play at the highest level and test myself against the best players in the world is fantastic
6091666 you do get the odd one or two text messages saying what are you up to but the people who mean a lot are really supportive
6091667 one opinion in particular that i respect is norm hewitts he sent a lovely e mail wishing me all the best and giving his blessing
6091668 he was a person i looked up to as a leader and a player when i first saw the e mail from him i thought oh heck he might say something about wearing the england jersey
6091669 but he told me to go and grab it with both hands and to do my best to get comments like that was a real boost
6091670 not once have i thought shucks what have i done im a kiwi i have no regrets whatsoever
6091671 im proud to wear my england training kit and hopefully ill get to pull on the jersey as well
6091672 if you look at the squad that went over there compared to this one its completely different
6091673 new management have come in there are new players around and some senior guys who have come back in to provide extra leadership
6091674 man that just sounded so good the only thing to do here is play it again
6091675 pro jahr fallen in den papierwerken weltweit 60 millionen tonnen lignin an
6091676 filmmakers who are in search of a supersized structure to destroy
6091677 weve surveyed our community and this has not been a high priority
6091678 it has to compete with the other things we need to do for our kids such as dealing with gangs truancy high school dropouts certainly childhood obesity is important but its not the only issue we have to deal with
6091679 wed like to present as many different faces during the convention as possible
6091680 we want to reflect the great diversity that this party has i suspect my face is a little bit different than most
6091681 in most international matches chus rivals were afraid of chu
6091682 133 victims have been registered but there are many graves which we are not yet able to examine
6091683 to prevent any possible allegation that the bodies were mutilated
6091684 we have talks about trade exchange in different fields including providing the brotherly lebanon with iraqi oil according to agreements that the ministers of the two countries would have a role in concluding them
6091685 there are always issues in the health system and we try to manage all of those issues as we go
6091686 functioning in a way which is undesirable people are being ventilated in the emergency department and in the recovery wards when that is not appropriate
6091687 theyve cut services at other hospitals such as the queen elizabeth hospital and theres no capacity in the system for emergencies or high stress on services
6091688 what we have here is a disaster waiting to happen
6091689 due to the unsuccessful enterprise bargaining thats occurred and until theres a resolution regarding that those out of school hours activities have been cancelled
6091690 nothing is more essential to the establishment of manners in a state than that all persons employed in places of power and trust must be men of unexceptionable characters
6091691 these courses are aimed at people who want careers in stadium management sports events leisure and recreation or to work for companies supplying sports goods for example
6091692 sports management is like running any other business it needs the right mix of commercial and leadership skills
6091693 during my involvement with the commonwealth games and my work in sports sponsorship i have found the very best people are the ones who understand the dynamics of business and sport
6091694 geothermal energy which is sometimes known as hot rocks has got a huge potential for australia both as a solution to climate change and in terms of national energy security
6091695 one percent of reserves would produce 26 000 years of energy supplies
6091696 the upper cost boundary will decline over time because the level of uncertainty is expected to narrow as the industry grows this cost is expected to be lowest cost of any form of renewable or low emissions energy
6091697 we could now see australias first commercially viable geothermal power plants in place within four to five years
6091698 geothermal energy provides clean base load power and is potentially a very important contributor to australias energy mix in a carbon constrained world
6091699 a partir du moment o le pr fet de la gironde prend des mesures de r pression nous le prenons au mot nous voulons savoir sil y a v ritablement pollution et si cest le cas qui est lorigine de cette pollution
6091700 de la section r gionale conchylicole et de 158 professionnels de la mer
6091701 dans la mesure o les professionnels concern s nont en rien modifi leurs m thodes de travail et o les coquillages sont impropres la consommation humaine il appara t que ceux ci ont t atteints par un facteur exog ne constitutif de pollution
6091702 the flora and fauna around us are shifting over time due to climate change
6091703 the result is desynchronisation if birds and the insects on which they depend do not react in the same way we are headed for an upheaval in the interaction between species
6091704 at any one site the community of birds you find there has changed over time
6091705 now more of the species that are found in warmer climates are occurring but that change is not occurring as fast as the change in temperature is
6091706 some species have changed their range hugely over the past two decades
6091707 for example the buzzard one of our biggest birds of prey 20 years ago was restricted to the west of britain but has now spread as far east as london
6091708 the position of the government is very clear we will not support nuclear power in australia because we dont need to mr fergusonsaid toabc radio
6091709 as a person who actually encouraged the development of our uranium mining industry i understand the importance of nuclear power beyond australia
6091710 but unlike australia a lot of those countries are not energy rich
6091711 for example just1 per cent of australias geothermal energy could equate to 26 000 times australias total energy consumption at any one time
6091712 so from the australian governments point of view encouragement of geothermal activity is exceptionally important
6091713 i would have thought that given our renewable energy target of 20 per cent by 2020 we could see a significant contribution of that 20 per cent from the geothermal industry
6091714 if we think that we can secure our country by just talking tough without acting tough and smart then we will misunderstand this moment and miss its opportunities
6091715 americans across our country are hurting because of the cost of energy
6091716 gas prices are through the roof energy costs have seeped into our grocery bills making it more expensive to feed our families and now as people prepare for the winter they are going to be hit with higher costs for home heating oil
6091717 he has said it will not solve our problem and that its not real
6091718 if we think that we can use the same partisan politics where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
6091719 the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
6091720 i will let no one question my love of this country i love america so do you and so does john mccain when i look out at this audience i see people of different political views you are democrats and republicans and independents but you all served together and fought together and bled together under the same proud flag you did not serve a red america or a blue america you served the united states of america
6091721 threatens to rapidly accelerate new delhis arms race with pakistan a rivalry made all the more precarious by the resignation on tuesday of the pakistani president pervez musharraf
6091722 this deal was foolish when pakistan was relatively stable with mr musharraf gone an arms race on the subcontinent would likely be more difficult to control
6091723 can say yes to nuclear trade with india if two simple conditions are met
6091724 would prove to the international community that opening up nuclear commerce would not assist either directly or indirectly its
6091725 in these harsh economic times measures must be taken to alleviate some of the financial pressures felt by citizens delaying the filing is a viable solution that should enable seniors and lower income individuals the additional time needed to seek assistance to remedy their situation rather than worsen it
6091726 if i was the neighbor right next to that id want as much barrier as i could have
6091727 there are no two opinions about the need to switch over to other modes of power generation like nuclear energy and hydro coal based power production has to be restricted
6091728 coal based power generation is not a feasible proposition coal stocks are limited and might not be there always to generate power at such a large scale
6091729 from april 2007 to january 2008 around 255 million tonnes of coal was supplied to power utilities against the annual action plan target of 249 97 million tonnes
6091730 the situation is grim and unless fast track measures are undertaken by the ministry of coal and coal companies the ntpc stations face serious threat of taking units out of bar
6091731 which is why we have advised the ministry of power to retain the target of importing 20 million tonnes of coal for power plants in 2008 09 it will help them build up coal stocks at power houses
6091732 a long term solution to meet increasing electricity needs lies in switching over to hydro and other renewable modes for generating energy
6091733 you dont know different here than america my husband will not want me to work so much i want to start a family
6091734 mochi media provides a deep level of gaming integration enabling our members to compete and engage with one another were constantly looking to increase the quality of our members experience and providing a social way to interact with web games is a perfect fit
6091735 mochi media helps solve a revenue problem that many social networks are facing since we dont allow banner advertising on the site and are the only major social network without it we are very selective about our revenue generation partners
6091736 it may well be on such a night of clouds and cruel colours that there is brought forth upon the earth such a portent as a respectable poet you say you are a poet of law i say you are a contradiction in terms i only wonder there were not comets and earthquakes on the night you appeared in this garden
6091737 you might transpose the words anywhere an anarchist is an artist the man who throws a bomb is an artist because he prefers a great moment to everything he sees how much more valuable is one burst of blazing light one peal of perfect thunder than the mere common bodies of a few shapeless policemen an artist disregards all governments abolishes all conventions the poet delights in disorder only if it were not so the most poetical thing in the world would be the underground railway
6091738 said gregory who was very rational when anyone else attempted paradox
6091739 why do all the clerks and navvies in the railway trains look so sad and tired so very sad and tired i will tell you it is because they know that the train is going right it is because they know that whatever place they have taken a ticket for that place they will reach it is because after they have passed sloane square they know that the next station must be victoria and nothing but victoria oh their wild rapture oh their eyes like stars and their souls again in eden if the next station were unaccountably baker street
6091740 if what you say of clerks is true they can only be as prosaic as your poetry the rare strange thing is to hit the mark the gross obvious thing is to miss it we feel it is epical when man with one wild arrow strikes a distant bird is it not also epical when man with one wild engine strikes a distant station chaos is dull because in chaos the train might indeed go anywhere to baker street or to bagdad but man is a magician and his whole magic is in this that he does say victoria and lo it is victoria no take your books of mere poetry and prose let me read a time table with tears of pride take your byron who commemorates the defeats of man give me bradshaw who commemorates his victories give me bradshaw i say
6091741 that every time a train comes in i feel that it has broken past batteries of besiegers and that man has won a battle against chaos you say contemptuously that when one has left sloane square one must come to victoria i say that one might do a thousand things instead and that whenever i really come there i have the sense of hair breadth escape and when i hear the guard shout out the word victoria it is not an unmeaning word it is to me the cry of a herald announcing conquest it is to me indeed victoria it is the victory of adam
6091742 we poets always ask the question and what is victoria now that you have got there you think victoria is like the new jerusalem we know that the new jerusalem will only be like victoria yes the poet will be discontented even in the streets of heaven the poet is always in revolt
6091743 what is there poetical about being in revolt you might as well say that it is poetical to be sea sick being sick is a revolt both being sick and being rebellious may be the wholesome thing on certain desperate occasions but im hanged if i can see why they are poetical revolt in the abstract is revolting its mere vomiting
6091744 that is poetical i our digestions for instance going sacredly and silently right that is the foundation of all poetry yes the most poetical thing more poetical than the flowers more poetical than the stars the most poetical thing in the world is not being sick
6091745 but i suppose that if you were serious about your anarchism that is exactly what you would do
6091746 do the people who talk like you and my brother often mean what they say do you mean what you say now
6091747 there are many kinds of sincerity and insincerity when you say thank you for the salt do you mean what you say no when you say the world is round do you mean what you say no it is true but you dont mean it now sometimes a man like your brother really finds a thing he does mean it may be only a half truth quarter truth tenth truth but then he says more than he means from sheer force of meaning it
6091748 he wouldnt really use bombs or that sort of thing
6091749 about order and anarchy there is your precious order that lean iron lamp ugly and barren and there is anarchy rich living reproducing itself there is anarchy splendid in green and gold
6091750 just at present you only see the tree by the light of the lamp i wonder when you would ever see the lamp by the light of the tree
6091751 but may i ask if you have been standing out here in the dark only to resume our little argument
6091752 i did not stand here to resume our argument but to end it for ever
6091753 this evening you succeeded in doing something rather remarkable you did something to me that no man born of woman has ever succeeded in doing before
6091754 one other person succeeded in doing it the captain of a penny steamer if i remember correctly at southend you have irritated me
6091755 i am afraid my fury and your insult are too shocking to be wiped out even with an apology
6091756 no duel could wipe it out if i struck you dead i could not wipe it out there is only one way by which that insult can be erased and that way i choose i am going at the possible sacrifice of my life and honour to prove to you that you were wrong in what you said
6091757 you said i was not serious about being an anarchist
6091758 i have never doubted that you were perfectly sincere in this sense that you thought what you said well worth saying that you thought a paradox might wake men up to a neglected truth
6091759 you think me serious you think me a flaneur who lets fall occasional truths you do not think that in a deeper a more deadly sense i am serious
6091760 good lord is this street serious are these damned chinese lanterns serious is the whole caboodle serious one comes here and talks a pack of bosh and perhaps some sense as well but i should think very little of a man who didnt keep something in the background of his life that was more serious than all this talking something more serious whether it was religion or only drink
6091761 you shall see something more serious than either drink or religion
6091762 you spoke just now of having a religion is it really true that you have one
6091763 then may i ask you to swear by whatever gods or saints your religion involves that you will not reveal what i am now going to tell you to any son of adam and especially not to the police
6091764 is far too idiotic to be declined you say that a poet is always an anarchist i disagree but i hope at least that he is always a sportsman permit me here and now to swear as a christian and promise as a good comrade and a fellow artist that i will not report anything of this whatever it is to the police and now in the name of colney hatch what is it
6091765 everyone who knows me knows i can be a jokester but i guess i took it too far
6091766 i never meant to say anything rude about michael i am 100 percent sorry for what i said i take full responsibility for it
6091767 its just something ive always been interested in i was going to do it on civvy street if i hadnt joined the army ive always been a bit of a tomboy
6091768 its going to be hard work but im really looking forward to it
6091769 there is only me going to bordon from the females in my platoon
6091770 i was in the cadets for four and a half years and my mum and dad were in the army because of my time in the cadets i aspired to join the army
6091771 the army is a good career its stable good money and you always have someone to turn to
6091772 its absolutely great they only send in the best instructors in the army to teach at the college
6091773 she has worked very hard its hard work at 16
6091774 i am now in full time work and proud of my achievements without step into construction and the qualifications and confidence it has given me i would still be out of work i now feel that i can be a good role model for my children and can see a future for myself and my family
6091775 jason was an excellent student and a pleasure to have on the programme the college is very proud of his achievements
6091776 i would have been very quick to dismiss coming into somewhere like here before this but it has opened my eyes and now i would consider going on the graduate scheme
6091777 it was a steep learning curve really as i did not have any experience of project management i decided this wasnt really for me so i came back and martin found me something else
6091778 it was my first experience in industry so i was not sure what to expect but everybody was really helpful it was difficult last year i was not expecting such a large open office with so many people it was like being thrown in at the deep end but thats what you need really because thats what it will be like when i eventually do get a job
6091779 it uses some of the skills you use as a mathematician like logic and analysis
6091780 although im at a good university its very competitive when you finish and if people see i have worked over the summer rather than just doing nothing its a good thing
6091781 the scheme started because there was an issue with graduates not returning to the area so i thought this was a good opportunity to give them a taste of industry and whet their appetite so that they come back and work for us which has been the case
6091782 its a massive success they dont really understand what we do in here until they get here they see us only as a shipbuilding and submarine building business and they dont realise all the other cogs that go into making the business work
6091783 its a good opportunity for us to look at them for potential and likewise for them to look at us to see if its a type of career they want to pursue
6091784 the benefit for them is that they can put what they are learning into practice in industry while the benefit for us is that they are doing some real work for the three months they are here
6091785 also theres the opportunity for us to offer them a position on the graduate scheme on completion of their degree course if they prove themselves to us and indicate a commitment to bae systems
6091786 a day after their unified effort ousted president pervez musharraf the two major parties in the governing coalition fell into disarray on tuesday when they failed to agree on the restoration of the chief justice of the supreme court the instant deterioration in relations became evident when nawaz sharif the leader of one of the parties the pakistan muslim league n walked out of a meeting here and headed back to his home in lahore a four hour drive away party members said mr sharif had delivered an ultimatum to the senior coalition party the pakistan peoples party led by asif ali zardari to consent to the return of the chief justice ifikhar mohammad chaudhry within 72 hours or the mr sharifs party would leave the government mr chaudhry was among some 60 judges suspended by mr musharraf last year
6091787 may have been the strongest thread tying them the opposition leaders together still the situation did not bode well for future stability with pakistan facing a sharply declining economy and an emboldened taliban insurgency that is fast moving past its sanctuaries in the tribal region and reaching into other parts of the country
6091788 administration officials will now have to find allies within the fractious civilian government which has so far shown scant interest in taking on militants from the taliban and al qaeda who have roosted in pakistans badlands along the border with afghanistan at the same time suspicions between the american and pakistani intelligence agencies and their militaries are deepening and relations between the countries are at their lowest point since mr musharraf pledged to ally pakistan with the united states after the 9 11 attacks among the greatest concerns senior american officials say is the durability of new controls over pakistans nuclear program though pakistan has been through far more abrupt political transitions than this one through assassinations a mysterious plane crash and coups this is the first since it amassed a large nuclear arsenal
6091789 yet it is the government not the military that is likely to face criticism at home and from its international allies
6091790 theres going to be enormous pressure on the civilian government from the american administration to get their acts together to show that they can confront militancy in pakistan rashid said
6091791 it will be a test of the coalition which i think will fall apart
6091792 but at least the military are back in their barracks another cycle of civilian soldier rule is over perhaps this time with the help of the international community pakistan can achieve a fragile democratic stability and defeat its internal demons perhaps
6091793 for one thing he says the pakistani leader never removed elements from his intelligence services that were working against the effort to fight the taliban and al qaida
6091794 the continuing terror war has led to great upheaval within pakistan making musharraf intensely unpopular in an opinion poll conducted last month by the international republican institute iri a non profit group based in washington 83 percent of pakistanis said they wanted musharraf to resign immediately his job approval rating also slipped to an all time low of 11 percent
6091795 for the last years he has been ruling the country and hes been no good to it said a banker who would give his name only as ahmed
6091796 is actually just that hit before the signal goes out again by the way this ancient computer i am writing on does not allow me to post images
6091797 i said chad would start the season i didnt say which one
6091798 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6091799 he was in beijing to support the tibetan people and all people around the world whose voices have been silenced by their governments a small piece of his portfolio as an artist who wont back down in the face of authority
6091800 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6091801 zavvi are the latest in a long line of big businesses desperate to hide this from their customers
6091802 if wed called the game kill the terrorists we wouldnt have any problems but its politically sensitive and thats what this is about
6091803 youve got to ask yourself why do zavvi feel the need to protect their customers from a board game that is critical of war and violence when they have no problem pushing computer games that celebrate and reward brutal and aggressive behaviour
6091804 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6091805 our results conclusively prove there is a causal relationship between immunization schedules and diabetes
6091806 the recent data shows that common childhood vaccines are especially dangerous to children with a strong family history of diabetes
6091807 parents of a child with a strong family history of insulin dependent diabetes should know that the administration of a full series of vaccines may have a greater than 5 percent chance of causing their child to develop diabetes
6091808 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6091809 in accordance with a decision taken by the russian defense minister the navy command has sent a notification via diplomatic channels to lithuania that baltic fleet mine sweepers will not take part in the open spirit 2008 international naval exercises in the baltic sea
6091810 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6091811 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now
6091812 today is the day the oceans begin to recede and the planet begins to heal
6091813 sort of kind of halfway a little bit not too far to the left
6091814 id say this is the most fundamental change weve made ever to the marketplace
6091815 consumers are voting with their wallets and saying auctions arent really the way i want to buy cosmetics or something like that
6091816 very opportunistic but also in line with what their customers are telling them they want
6091817 this will be viewed as ebay continues to push paypal down everyones throat
6091818 out loud maybe lucy will wake up as soon as all cools down a bit
6091819 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6091820 in the current economic condition people are driving less and it obviously affects every facet of the u s auto industry including how often they replace tires or buy new cars
6091821 the current economic condition further impacted the stores but they were not performing well before this year and we dont expect them to perform well
6091822 well you know i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
6091823 whoever the next president is health care should be at the top of his agenda
6091824 are credited for kicking off the subsequent boom in public policy advertising
6091825 the ads were seen as evidence that pitching policy issues directly to voters can be as effective as lobbying capitol hill action
6091826 the ads were used 15 years ago to oppose efforts to health care reform and i think that 15 years later theyre being used by a diverse group of people to take it up to argue that weve reached critical mass and its really time to bring diverse opinions together and come up with a solution
6091827 everybody remembers who harry and louise were and that they hated the clinton plan
6091828 its very amusing at first when i read that it the new ad was by the same ad agency i assumed the insurance industry was behind it
6091829 we had just done a round of health care reform in minnesota and we were hopeful the federal government would be a partner and of course it didnt work out so well
6091830 my own taste is i wish they had used somebody different but i guess americans might remember them more
6091831 it is kind of a flip flop really the original harry and louise ads were designed to try and make people be afraid of having the federal government do anything in this area
6091832 the ads arent calling for a single payer system and advocacy for a single payer system would be inconsistent with the american cancer society because we dont endorse any particular approach candidate or party
6091833 the health care dialogue in america has been primarily a political one and while weve been distracted by ideological politics the problem has grown its time to take the conversation out of the political realm and design a system where people can beat cancer and be healthy
6091834 what its going to take is people on both sides or all sides of all aisles rising above those divisions and being able to come together to come up with a solution
6091835 health care costs are up again small companies are being forced to cut their plans
6091836 tell me about it you know lisas husband just found out he has cancer
6091837 no he just joined a startup and he cant afford a plan
6091838 whoever the next president is health care should be at the top of his agenda bringing everyone to the table and make it happen
6091839 one of the most amusing typos of the season turned up for awhile overnight in a major associated press dispatch some in the liberal blogosphere who have often criticized sen joe lieberman the democrat turned independent who has endorsed john mccain found it all too apt
6091840 were aware of that perception and its not that far off
6091841 but we actually have writers from an incredibly wide range of backgrounds and were always trying to expand our reach so that anyone who is interested in writing can come to us
6091842 were at capacity for classes at the open book space right now and its our goal to move into the community more
6091843 if you believe that libraries are about lifelong learning access to information well many would contend that writing is central to that
6091844 other libraries offer writing classes theyll hear that people want to write for business or another topic so theyll bring in someone for a class what were doing is a solid partnership with a premiere writing organization and these will be very high quality writing opportunities on all kinds of topics for all kinds of people
6091845 these are writing labs to give you a glimpse of what it would be like to open up your brain and put something on a piece of paper
6091846 weve leveled the playing field so that whoever wants it can have it everyone has a story whether they want to try to publish it or put it quietly in a drawer for the next generation

6091931 it offers us nothing aside from one standout evolutionary concept the public quest that moves the genre forward

6091937 les derniers sondages d montrent quaux yeux de 63 de polonais leur gouvernement a eu raison de se joindre au programme am ricain de bouclier antimissile par ailleurs pour 65 dentre eux la russie constitue une menace pour leur pays
6091938 voil qui est tr s surprenant dans la mesure o au d but de mois de juillet les opposants au bouclier taient encore majoritaires
6091939 ce sont sans doute les v nements en g orgie qui ont provoqu ce revirement de lopinion publique polonaise
6091940 nous avons appris aimer le bouclier par peur de la russie
6091941 il est clair que les propos mena ants des g n raux et des politiciens russes prof r s contre la pologne ont bien t entendus
6091942 evesham was a ghost town we were stranded at work we looked at each other and just thought why dont we really push this internet thing
6091943 the water didnt come into our shop on the high street but our customers were in caravans theyd had to move out of their homes who wants a freezer full of meat in a caravan and there was no barbecue season who wants a floating barbecue
6091944 our customers know its more economical to buy meat from us than the supermarket due to its superior quality and taste
6091945 we still have strong local trade but we knew there was potentially a nationwide market for high quality meat and we were really keen to continue to support british farmers
6091946 with the uk becoming ever more health conscious people generally seem to be seeking more healthy and economical options
6091947 weve found that people want the convenience of a supermarket but the quality of the local butcher they are beginning to understand now that you can have fresh meat delivered and due to technological advances its quality is not going to suffer in transit
6091948 online meat trading is in its early years and many people still dont yet understand its possible trust from customers can be an issue with a website but we deliver what we say we will and customers come back
6091949 people also appreciate the quality of traditional farm reared meat even in these days of tightened household budgets its not all about competing on price comparing what we deliver to supermarket meat can be a false economy its like comparing ford to mercedes

6091954 it is incredible that they are able to straight facingly say something like that
6091955 the radio frequency impact of delivering a text message is very low
6091956 i could basically run the entire worlds text messaging network on my mac mini at home it wouldnt have a significant impact
6091957 if the cellphone companies continue to be anti competitive and canadians continue to use cellphones the way they have we have a growing rationale and a call for regulation
6091958 they went to have a meeting with the ceos of the telephone companies and the ceos of the companies told them to get lost
6091959 these companies dont seem to realize that airwaves are public trust they dont belong to somebody in private and so a certain basic standard of fairness and accessibility needs to be provided
6091960 the canadian cellphone market is discouragingly uncompetitive and expensive by world standards fixing those issues will require more work than a couple of press releases and hollow assurances that canadian consumers enjoy plenty of choice
6091961 what the telephone companies are doing is making money while they can
6091962 its hard to tell right now what will actually happen but when there are four five six people in the business it will be less easy for them to not compete

6091976 oil and how lebanon could benefit from iraqs potential in this area and secondly research on how to strengthen and develop trade exchange between the two countries particularly that iraq is the most important trade partner of arab lebanon and great opportunities with the third focuses on the development of diplomatic relations between the two countries especially iraqs arab country is very important it is necessary for openness
6091977 the source added that he will ask al maliki during his meeting with siniora today the lebanese companies to invest in the country and participate in the reconstruction of the affected cities especially in time of the former regime or which negatively affected due to military operations or by terrorist acts stressing that the iraqi file in lebanon will be among themes that would deal with both sides
6091978 this is particularly significant given the multitude of challenges facing the government of iraq today
6091979 it is a strong political signal for nuclear disarmament and non proliferation my hope is that it will encourage other countries of the region and beyond to follow suit
6091980 with the background of the nuclear ambitions iraq entertained in the late 1980s and early 1990s joining the family of ctbt member states is an important political step

6091984 an urgent book on the very dark topic of the virtual end of reading among the young
6091985 the intellectual condition of young americans and describes it with empirical evidence recording something insidious happening inside their heads
6091986 as yet another curmudgeonly riff older people have complained forever about the derelictions of youth and the old fogy tag puts them on the defensive
6091987 young americans today are no more learned or skilful than their predecessors no more knowledgeable fluent up to date or inquisitive except in the material of youth culture
6091988 they dont know any more history or civics economics or science literature or current events they read less on their own both books and newspapers and you would have to canvas a lot of college english instructors and employers before you found one who said they compose better paragraphs

6091992 are the kids all right depends upon whom you ask
6091993 can be just as intellectually challenging as reading a book
6091994 how the digital age stupefies young americans and jeopardizes our future
6091995 and you see that the indulgent attitude toward youth along with the downplaying of tradition has reached the point of dogma
6091996 like so many dominant cultural attitudes today the final ennobling of youth motives and attribution of youth authenticity derive from the revolutionary heat of the 1960s
6091997 results from many causes but one of them is precisely a particular culture war outcome the war over the status of youth fought four decades ago from roughly 1955 to 1975 youth movements waged culture warfare and the mentors who should have fought back surrendered

6092021 david cameron is right to highlight that serious and destructive social breakdown
6092022 politicians who pretend there is not a problem are complacent and should recognise that there is a huge challenge if every teenager is to fulfill their potential as our athletes have managed this week
6092023 if you believe the politicians we have a broken society in which the courage and morals of young people have been sapped by welfaism and political correctness
6092024 its just another pr stunt for them to gain more press for her album

6092102 the associated press document provides additional evidence suggesting the color color campaigns insistence that obama was never trained in islam and he never lived as a muslim is not accurate
6092103 moreover the document indicated that obama may have been an indonesian citizen when he lived there
6092104 this is an issue the obama rebuttal fails to address at all evidently conceding the accuracy of the claim

6092106 when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6092107 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6092108 it is an agreement which will help us to respond to the threats of the 21st century
6092109 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6092110 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now
6092111 that hairline difference between nuance and what appears to be flip flopping is hurting him with liberal voters
6092112 conservatives were supposed to be the bigger problem for mccain
6092113 obama still has work to do on his base at this point mccain seems to be doing a better job with his
6092114 there were no wild swings there isnt one group that is radically different than last month or even two months ago it was just a steady decline for obama across the board
6092115 little or no attention is being paid to the long term fall in oxygen concentrations and its knock on effects
6092116 the o2 concentration of the atmosphere has been measured off and on for about 100 years now and the concentration at 20 95 has not varied within the accuracy of the measurements only in recent years have more precise measurement techniques been developed and the tiny decrease in o2 with increasing co2 has been actually measured but i believe the o2 concentration is still close to 20 95 there is so much o2 in the atmosphere it is believed not to be substantially affected by vegetation but it is the result of geochemistry in deep ocean sediments no one really knows for sure since too much o2 is not good for humans the human body keeps o2 concentrations down to around 5 in our major organs extra o2 can give you a burst of energy but it will harm you or kill you if the exposure is too long it has been estimated that global wildfire risk would increase greatly if o2 concentrations were much more than they are now to say that there is an impending oxygen crisis on earth is the epitome of fear mongering
6092117 gary millers kennedy vs the machine was one of the most important things to happen in the blogosphere in the last two years
6092118 gary ive continued to enjoy reading kvm throughout the campaign youd make a great reporter and please dont take that as an insult
6092119 gary fifteen years later and youre still to the rescue more acute and heroic than ever
6092120 gary miller who started kvm and is as good a blogger as exists has not wavered in his criticism of zogbys methodology
6092121 despite the fact that you have taken a few petty and gratuitous shots at me i want to quote your web site great point on the federalist papers
6092122 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
6092123 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine
6092124 minnesotas conservative blog community spawned kennedy vs the machine which pushes senate candidate mark kennedy by bashing state and national democrats
6092125 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
6092126 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant

6092133 each state has its own vision for dealing with iraq
6092134 saudis have their own vision and reasons for not approaching iraq however if the iraqi government alters its national policy the saudi government will change its approach
6092135 they are trying to share power with iran both are trying to undermine each others agenda in iraq
6092136 in coordination with its major allies most prominently the united states saudi arabia did not want to offer a free service to baghdad government
6092137 it is trying to employ its strategic weight to urge the iraqi government achieve its demands
6092138 these demands can be summarized in an openness towards sunni arabs and an interaction with former sunni groups
6092139 wassit province signed a contract with gem group to implement investment projects in the province including building an advanced hospital and water treatment plants

6092156 when oil and the stock market go down together you know theres real reason to worry
6092157 i am totally overwhelmed with the response we have had this year
6092158 luckily the victim did not suffer a major injury but that does not excuse the seriousness of the crime nor the fact the offender was carrying a dangerous weapon and held it to the face of a young boy
6092159 we all know the tragic consequences that carrying a knife can cause and we have all seen the headlines
6092160 i would appeal to anyone who has information about this incident or who witnessed the robbery to come forward so we can find this man and punish him
6092161 he was celebrating his achievements and rolled over the bonnet of a parked taxi that was waiting outside

6092163 a man who is convinced of the truth of his religion is indeed never tolerant and he is unable to be tolerant at the least he is to feel pity for the adherent of another religion but usually it does not stop there the faithful adherent of a religion will try first of all to convince those that believe in another religion and usually he goes on to hatred if he is not successful however hatred leads to persecution when the might of the majority is behind it

6092167 i want each of you to very slowly turn and look around at each other
6092168 look at you consumed in my tale how what is happening to you
6092169 what is it that happens when a story is told
6092170 he was under pressure on debut especially against murali and mendis but he played them really well he took up the challenge and responsibility and showed some character
6092171 hes been performing consistently over the years back home and on india a tours it was reversing and turning a bit and at one end we had a batsman badrinath but the other end was open
6092172 it was badrinaths first game and he had the pressure of scoring thats what gives you confidence and the more experience you get the better you dont need to play 100 games for that even 25 such games will give you much more experience the more you are in these conditions the more comfortable you will be in the future it is good preparation but it takes its toll too you need to really concentrate
6092173 well im losing some hair but it is a pleasure to go out there under pressure and perform
6092174 thats what youre supposed to do at this level people expect you to score and its a privilege a win is always good because the morale goes up and you start believing you can deal with pressure once youre square you can look into the opponents eyes and tell them that if we play good cricket we can definitely beat you
6092175 ive been playing for four years and ive seen him bowl like this he has moved way ahead when it comes to his fielding as well hes there more than 100 he bowled really well in england too and its really good to have someone like him
6092176 at times when a bowler doesnt get wickets people tend to say hes a weak bowler but it is about the effort put in you wont always have a good day unless you bowl in partnerships you wont get wickets if zaheer struck praveen kumars impact was also good he bowled really well with the new ball
6092177 it was a deceptive pitch with something in it for the fast bowlers
6092178 in tough hot and humid conditions they bowled consistently but i dont think they will get such conditions in the coming matches

6092198 people often pit pcs against consoles but consoles are not at all bad for the pc gaming market
6092199 first of all the number of people working in the industry and creating videogames because of consoles is at a record high how could that be bad and most console owners in the west also own a pc
6092200 consoles offer a baseline experience and pc is the best it can be so i dont think consoles pose any threat to pc
6092201 the west can close the gap on asia by introducing more high quality free to play games
6092202 in fact it has to do that because if game companies over here dont do it then asian companies will be coming over here and dominating the business theres no doubt

6092241 what government should be focused on is raising the incomes and the aspirations and the opportunities for the millions of people who are stuck on low incomes and that is where this government has failed not because they are bad people not because they dont have noble ambitions but because their measure which is entirely reliant on the state which is about redistribution has failed failed on their own terms
6092242 our education system is failing to spread opportunity our welfare system is keeping people out of work our tax system makes it extremely difficult for those on low incomes to get off those low incomes because those marginal tax rates are so high
6092243 labour has failed it has created a more unfair society and i think there is a real opportunity for the conservative party now to lead this debate
6092244 we will keep tax credits but we will add to the battle on poverty other things like welfare reform like extending educational opportunity like supporting families and these conservative methods of achieving progressive goals are likely to be far more successful and create a fairer society
6092245 at the moment borrowing is rising and thats a real issue
6092246 george osbornes restaurant has a menu without prices there is something for everyone but no one has to pay
6092247 what passes for conservative policy is nothing but a series of hopelessly vague ambitions
6092248 they would rather repeatedly tell us that we are broken than say what they would do to fix things the only genuine policy they have is a tax break for the richest 6 of people
6092249 its time for the conservatives to realise that power must be earned not inherited and to start setting out some serious policies
6092250 if this is the best the tories can do to claim they are a party of fairness then the labour party is delighted that the battle will be joined on this issue
6092251 george osbornes speech shows we are fighting a tory party that for all the talk of change is still committed to the old unfair policies
6092252 george osborne offers empty rhetoric on child poverty now but people will remember that this is the same shadow chancellor whose flagship tax policy diverts 1bn to the 3 000 richest estates in the country
6092253 and this is the same tory party that opposed the minimum wage opposed pension credit and the winter fuel allowance opposed support for families through tax credits and still wont commit to any real pledge on child poverty

6092442 the weight of evidence we examined from both historical and modern analyses of the 1918 influenza pandemic favors a scenario in which viral damage followed by bacterial pneumonia led to the vast majority of deaths

6092444 ranging from changes characteristic of the primary viral pneumonia and evidence of tissue repair to evidence of severe acute secondary bacterial pneumonia

6092452 so it was just more where is the team going short and long term
6092453 you have to be ready to react to circumstances that are going to improve you long term
6092454 and marian understood that because ultimately a lot of these decisions are long term decisions for him now too
6092455 ive always been honest with him its plain and simple he wants to hear the information theres no doubt about that and ultimately its needed especially when youre going to sign a player to that length of contract
6092456 we dont generally talk about these things so thats why were not announcing anything specific
6092457 hell still be signed while some of those contracts will be up so he wanted to kind of know what the plans are
6092458 theres no better way to be able to commit money and term to a player that youve developed like this guy for a long term contract
6092459 as ive said i think its better that you are able to sign these types of players to long term contracts when theyre in their prime

6092472 we have had a few chats and some of the senior guys have an idea what i should do
6092473 if he moves late you cannot do anything if the ball has already left your hand
6092474 if he does move early you maybe could pull out but i suppose it is also a good opportunity for a wicket if you get it right
6092475 if he is totally turning around then his head is moving
6092476 but you have to acknowledge he has done it well so far i have seen him five to 10 times and he has never failed
6092477 if we can set it up early and take a lead i am sure the confidence should take us through to the end and we can win the series
6092478 during that period i had to really think about my bowling and be really on my game so that if something didnt feel right with my bowling i knew what it was
6092479 that helped me to groove my action and feel my action a bit more so i can work it out if something goes wrong
6092480 o bien la m xima ignorancia de los mecanismos m s elementales del estado de derecho que no es presumible en quienes sostienen a un gobierno democr tico o bien la confusi n absoluta entre los partidos y los rganos de gobierno por ellos gestionados

6092503 while her positions would seem to be political suicide in conservative kansas she has enjoyed high approval ratings winning her last election in 2006 by a landslide sebelius has been a master at taking advantage of the schism in the the constant warfare between the so called conservatives and so called moderates and she has worked hard to focus on issues that have widespread appeal to most kansans such as education and health care

6092505 warner will likely tout his bipartisanship and bring a message that appeals both to the democratic base as well as independents it is what has made him immensely popular in a traditionally republican state and the postpartisan message worked for obama four years ago
6092506 dont expect warner to throw red meat on the republicans in denver or for him to utilize soaring poetry the way obama did

6092510 multiple gop sources say that party officials in washington and in the states have been contacted by the mccain campaign in the past two weeks and asked about the fallout from such a choice one person familiar with the calls said the party was being instructed to prepare for different candidate prototypes including one in the mold of lieberman who is an independent but still caucuses with the democrats
6092511 would be unusual if not in the context of being vetted
6092512 the party might accept it but the party will just implode
6092513 the purpose of the trip says lieberman is to discuss the russian invasion with local leaders and assess its impact on nato and future u s russian relations

6092555 he was a very brave boy very smart he had a huge heart i was just proud that i got to spend a whole day with him and im touched by the fact that he came to my apartment and spent quality time its something that ill be inspired by for the rest of my life
6092556 its depressing man it makes you realize how short life is and how unfair it can be but i think whats cool is that even with what he had he chose to make the best of it and touch a lot of lives that he wouldnt have if this hadnt happened to him he got the bad end of the deal but he touched a lot of people for sure he touched the 25 people in here he was special to me
6092557 what john brought all of us for the day he was with us the courage he showed the message he had its something well never forget the number of lives that he touched in a short period of time is phenomenal i think if he was sitting here today if he could talk to us he would say dont fret he did all he wanted to do
6092558 thats been the most physically and mentally draining that ive played in
6092559 its shattering really i know weve finished with the bronze and i guess you have to be proud of that but this team has played so well over the last couple of games and to finish it like that is extremely disappointing

6092570 we cant rest on our laurels and say thats fine it hasnt passed yet
6092571 if it doesnt pass today it very possibly could after the election
6092572 we are not even in the preliminary stage in terms of how we are going to save money
6092573 we need to be there even if there are no budget cuts now the future does not look good for community colleges
6092574 we have concluded that we will not go to a four day schedule

6092579 es ist allerdings sehr schwierig immer die genaue ursache f r die zerst rung auszumachen
6092580 diese studie erlaubt keine schl ssigen beweise dass eisen f r diese invasion verantwortlich ist
6092581 man sollte anhand dieser ergebnisse allerdings nicht alle schiffswracks vom meeresgrund entfernen viele dieser schiffe und boote bieten zahlreichen meerestieren darunter auch fischen und korallen schutz und wirken wie kleine marine schutzzonen
6092582 eine garantie dass mit der bergung des wracks die korallen wieder kommen gibt es nicht
6092583 es ist nicht logisch warum korallen das wrack nicht in beschlag genommen haben
6092584 da haben offensichtlich luftreinhaltegesetze in nordamerika und in europa ihre wirkung gezeigt
6092585 das konnten wir auch anhand von ru und schwefel die zweifellos bei der verbrennung von kohle entstehen nachweisen
6092586 ber das schwermetall thallium in der arktis gibt es bisher kaum untersuchungen
6092587 wie verschiedene chemikalien in die nahrungskette gelangen ist uns ja bekannt was aber immer noch weitgehend unbekannt ist ist die frage was geschieht wenn verschiedene chemikalien gemeinsam auftreten
6092588 chemikalien interagieren ebenso wie auch verschiedene medikamente die ein mensch zu sich nimmt
6092589 bei der produktion von bioethanol in europa fallen je nach eingesetztem rohstoff verschiedene wertvolle futtermittel an in bisherigen studien wurden diese nie genauer untersucht und angerechnet bezieht man in die berechnungen jedoch alle faktoren mit ein berraschen die biokraftstoffe der sogenannten ersten generation mit ihren positiven treibhausgas und energiebilanzen
6092590 diese freisetzungseffekte m ssen bei der treibhausgasbilanzierung von biokraftstoffen ber cksichtigt werden ebenso m ssen direkte und indirekte landnutzungs nderungen durch die umwandlung von naturfl chen zu ackerland f r den rohstoffanbau zur biokraftstoffproduktion bei den biokraftstoffen aus den jeweiligen erzeugungsregionen angerechnet werden es geht nicht an die regenwaldabholzung und die verdr ngung von sojaanbau oder viehwirtschaft aus herk mmlichen erzeugungsregionen auf naturfl chen au en vor zu lassen
6092591 eine sachgerechte bewertung der verwendeten rohstoffe und technologien setzt voraus dass alle biokraftstoffe ob aus europa oder aus s damerika nach denselben objektiven kriterien beurteilt werden
6092592 es darf keine willk rliche bevorzugung einzelner biokraftstoffe geben alle biokraftstoffe m ssen nach denselben umfassenden und objektiven kriterien bewertet werden
6092593 im gro en und ganzen gibt es mehrere verschiedene dimensionen in denen videospiele effekte auf menschen aus ben k nnen
6092594 ein pauschalurteil ber videospiele kann deshalb nicht abgegeben werden sie sind weder gut noch schlecht
6092595 videospiele k nnen ein m chtiges erziehungs und trainingswerkzeug sein und effekte nach sich ziehen die f r uns sehr berraschend sind
6092596 auch in sterreich gibt es bereits zwei untersuchungen die einen positiven effekt von videospielen auf die f higkeiten der spieler best tigen
6092597 der trend zu geschicklichkeits und denkspielen zieht sich quer durch alle gamer zielgruppen die steigende tendenz zeigt sich auch deutlich in den entsprechenden verkaufszahlen
6092598 es ist zwar neu dass man l nger vor dem video oder vor dem computer sitzt aber das hat offensichtlich keine auswirkungen auf den generellen energieverbrauch
6092599 wenn wir also nicht weniger k rperliche aktivit ten setzen dann muss es wohl die menge an nahrungsmitteln sein die das durchschnittliche gewicht in die h he schnellen l sst
6092600 im vergleich zu den verbrauchern in den usa zeigen die verbraucher in deutschland und im vereinigten k nigreich bei den 13 in der studie untersuchten technologien ein bedeutend st rkeres interesse an alternativen antriebstechnologien insbesondere bei sauberen dieseltechnologien
6092601 der interessenunterschied kann auf die tendenz der verbraucher in den eu m rkten kleinere fahrzeuge zu kaufen die wiederum der hybridelektrischen technologie zutr glicher sind zur ckgef hrt werden dieseltechnologie ist zudem in diesen regionen viel verbreiteter als in den usa
6092602 geringes interesse an satellitenradios ist auf die geringe marktdurchdringung dieser technik sowohl in deutschland als auch im vereinigten k nigreich zur ckzuf hren
6092603 allerdings ist es wahrscheinlich dass mit dem auftauchen neuer satellitenradiobetreiber nicht nur die bekanntheit sondern auch das allgemeine interesse an dieser funktion zunimmt

6092609 we are thrilled that the first ever global game board includes an interesting mix of cities that showcases the dynamic cultures sights and history of the planet
6092610 in terms of promoting canada and tourism here this is good and it goes to 103 countries around the world
6092611 literally if you look at this board its quite interesting
6092612 its all based on the votes and how they placed in the voting and has pretty much nothing to do with financial and geographical flow which is traditionally what we think of in monopoly
6092613 we are thrilled that the first ever global game board includes an interesting mix of cities that showcases the dynamic cultures sights and history of the planet
6092614 from a tourism perspective what better advertising could you get and i think people will be talking
6092615 but at this stage i dont really consider myself a jazz musician

6092639 large corporations dont hide income but they might engage in very sophisticated transactions that reduce their tax liability in ways that arent appropriate
6092640 its so hard to determine what these prices should be
6092641 you can argue that the price of something should be 200 instead of 100 and theres nobody who can say with absolute certainty what the price should be
6092642 fully compliant with the tax laws of the in may the treasury inspector general for tax administration tigta which provides independent oversight of irs activities according to its website released a report stating that the irs
6092643 the irs doesnt have the resources to adequately examine even corporate returns they have identified as having problems
6092644 given the resources the irs has policing transfer pricing is like policing the new jersey turnpike on a bicycle
6092645 there can be perfectly legitimate reasons why corporations arent paying taxes
6092646 there can also be less legitimate ones were unable from the work that we did to actually comment on those
6092647 the competetive market has not held down ceo salaries while its held down employee salaries
6092648 this report isnt saying that exxon mobil or any fortune 500 company isnt paying tax you cant infer that
6092649 thirty six is the rate in the code but nobody pays it if they do theyve got to fire their accountants
6092650 in swimming there are so many little things you can change that really do make a big difference in the end were able to go back to the drawing board and work on the small things that can make a big difference
6092651 for me when i watch other sports when i watch tiger woods when i watch roger federer when i watch rafael nadal the best athletes can compete under any circumstances no matter what it is no matter what the pressure you can always overcome whatever is put in your way
6092652 i dont think about it like that i think of it as something i love to do and i am having fun with it
6092653 doing normal high school kid things was something i was willing to give up i know i wont have opportunities like this in the sport for the rest of my life

6092704 database archiving often fails to get the attention it needs compared to other critical activities related to production databases and data warehouses
6092705 an archival system becomes critical when you need to access archived information in response to a legal summons customer service issue security investigation or technical issue the value of archiving grows considerably as it becomes easier to access the archived data
6092706 with legal demands for access growing conventional approaches to database archiving are increasingly being found lacking they focus on lifting and shifting inactive data from production databases to improve application performance without considering how to optimize the way archived data is stored get your archiving right and you reduce storage costs and guarantee simple future proofed access get it wrong and at worst you could face prison
6092707 why database archiving should be part of your dbms strategy

6092714 es gibt keinen grund warum ein angemessener titel f r erwachsene nicht produziert werden sollte was ich sehe ist dass publisher sich von titeln wegbewegen die ausschlie lich erwachsene themen behandeln und die lediglich schockieren wollen

6092719 the goal is to give students skills that hopefully let them be social at school
6092720 a lot of it is working together deciding who was going to do which part who goes first it was working as a team toward a common goal
6092721 the other goal was to show their parents different ways that their child could be successful

6092728 gould concedes that such an experiment is unsustainable in the modern world

6092734 now that i am at home i will try to win it back
6092735 i hope our victories will show that china has great boxers
6092736 we can compete with everyone when we have the chance
6092737 its very difficult for the boxers especially asian boxers because their skills are based on technique
6092738 im just taking everything step by step enjoying the ride
6092739 i really want to spend as much time with my friends and family as i can
6092740 its coming up on two months on the road i want to be able to see them and just relax

6092742 my friends in the car business so hes going to help me
6092743 ive been looking at some aston martins and some maseratis it would be pretty sweet to get an old school aston martin some of the old school james bond ones that would be sick
6092744 it kind of bugs me im always getting rocked i need to get my video game skills up thats for sure
6092745 i would rather it be three months but i wanted it to be five so that it was probably longer than he wants and when he comes back hes really ready to come back
6092746 hes on his own now he makes all the decisions outside the pool and i take care of the pool
6092747 in athens he had never had any personal freedom at all now hes had a lot and hes screwed it up and hes learned what that means hes done a pretty good job with it i had my doubts in the beginning that we were going to get there but now i think hes got it down
6092748 it sounds really cliched but its true hes really grown as a human being
6092749 that in itself is going to serve him well as he makes these decisions in the upcoming few months and few years
6092750 i think hell just want to be a celebrity whatever that means hell just have to keep improving if he wants to do that he handles himself so much better than he did i was just amazed at some of the answers he gave to a lot of these questions this time
6092751 im happy to help him out if he wants a hand with some of these things
6092752 i think its just distant i dont think its good or bad theres not much there
6092753 its like michael said the other day debbie wants to go to rome i want to go to rome thats why were going
6092754 itll just be what it is he could probably do without it
6092755 we just have to play it by ear and see how things go but definitely start some new events and see where it takes us
6092756 i did well today i felt some pressure during the performance but i tried to tell myself that it was a training not a competition
6092757 when he got angry it was really scary since hes pretty strong even if we tried we wouldnt have been able to stop him
6092758 after numerous tests and evaluations it was determined that he needed which was performed this afternoon the surgery was a complete success and he is resting comfortably
6092759 we are most grateful for all of the prayers and support we have received
6092760 im just taking everything step by step enjoying the ride
6092761 i really want to spend as much time with my friends and family as i can
6092762 its coming up on two months on the road i want to be able to see them and just relax

6092777 we just have to play it by ear and see how things go but definitely start some new events and see where it takes us
6092778 we certainly hope youre not banged up too bad can you find it in your great big heart to forgive us
6092779 it is a taboo subject in defence which apparently hasnt learned anything since vietnam
6092780 the increase in fare evasion may have been due to the increased congestion on trains leading to difficulties associated with checking tickets
6092781 or it may be due to customer dissatisfaction with service delivery during this period stemming from increased cancellations resulting from rolling stock brake failures
6092782 these figures show train tram and bus services are more popular than ever
6092783 patronage forecasts indicate that the metropolitan train system will be under significant and sustained growth and pressure beyond 2012
6092784 the magnitude of growth forecast over this period will place pressure on all aspects of the train network
6092785 where are john brumby and public transport minister lynne kosky going to fit these additional people who want to climb on board
6092786 vehicle safety technologies are regularly identified as a countermeasure to the number of crashes and injuries
6092787 currently the safety benefits of new technologies are predominantly restricted to luxury vehicles
6092788 leading edge technologies are largely absent from australian made vehicles
6092789 the committee has seen convincing evidence that vehicles imported and even those manufactured in australia often have safety technologies removed from models sold in australia
6092790 if the government is going to decriminalise the process we need to do it with our eyes wide open and demand modern legislation that spells out a standard of care for our women
6092791 i am determined to get support from all mps to pass amendments whatever the outcome of the conscience vote
6092792 the government is trying to radically reform abortion laws to make it far easier for women to have abortions with no legal consideration of the human cost
6092793 the bill represents an enormous step forward in safeguarding womens rights to appropriate timely and safe clinical care
6092794 once legislation to decriminalise abortion is passed the rights and safety of women mothers sisters daughters will at long last be protected
6092795 accidents take a huge toll on families our communities and the economy
6092796 thats why the black spot program is a vital element in the governments plan to improve road safety
6092797 its a program that the labor government has kept on because of its obvious value to communities right around victoria
6092798 prince christian had taken off his bathing shorts and didnt want to put them back on
6092799 the crown princess and crown prince became aware that there were photographers who had taken photos they asked them not to use these photos and the photographers said ok fine
6092800 just to make sure that everything was ok i called three weeklies in denmark the three magazines that were present at the time and asked them if they would please not use those photographs
6092801 two said of course they would not but the third said they would
6092802 when the press show up at this event there is no frederik and mary when the queen is asked why theyre not there she says they are stuck in traffic
6092803 clearly what happened was that frederik and mary decided to boycott this event because the editor went ahead and published these pictures
6092804 it would have been tempting but its not the case the two incidents had nothing to do with each other
6092805 with the exception of peak periods i think normally we would be looking at a 299 fare from kuala lumpur to london so all in return within 1000
6092806 that would probably be in the first half of next year as soon as we get our uk service going
6092807 where else in the world can you go down to bells to surf on a saturday and then up to hotham to snowboard on a sunday
6092808 if you dont bend over and take it from the president youre not serious about the war on terror
6092809 it wont matter where you are in 4 years anyway
6092810 maybe the other side of the black hole is a world of bacon and marshmallows what could be wrong in a world of bacon and marshmallows
6092811 america is being overrun by an invasion force from mexico
6092812 wanted to do it to symbolize honoring him as the candidate for the democrats and honoring the fact that we played such a huge role 100 years ago when this convention democrat was here last
6092813 america is being overrun by an invasion force from mexico
6092814 those questions are best left to the mccain campaign at this time
6092815 first if your instinct is to run on experience it doesnt hurt to have a vice president whos got it too
6092816 it would fit well into the narrative of his not having any politics in the white house
6092817 no more dick morris no more karl rove were governing here its an easy natural message for mccain and it implies a one term pledge without actually saying it
6092818 the question is on sept 15 or 25 is he in better shape or not
6092819 i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
6092820 that would be like obama picking some right winger that agrees with him on one thing
6092821 please keep senator mccain and his key advisers in your prayers as he nears a decision on his vp pick and please sign the petition and pass on to like minded pro lifers
6092822 you will not have a unanimous vote at the convention that much i can tell you
6092823 the drive bys are just hoping for it because they know the base will totally turn on mccain if this is the case
6092824 if he picks a pro choice running mate its not going to be pretty and the drive bys know it
6092825 the question is how to get the message to mccain
6092826 you dont get in mccains face and say dont do it
6092827 damn my uncle dewayne used to buy crack there in the 70s
6092828 if you dont go home with me i might stab you in the eardrum with a needle

6092831 when i hear that women are being treated unfairly in the workplace
6092832 are you going to set an agenda of change or one of compromise
6092833 youre feisty and i like that but youre wrong let me tell you why youre wrong
6092834 i intend to get things done as president that means that yes sometimes were going to need to compromise to get things done theres nothing wrong with compromise as long as you understand what your core principles are
6092835 everybody making more than 2 5 million raise your hands

6092839 i donated to the obama campaign because i was so excited and thrilled to hear him speak
6092840 i like what he says and i like what he represents and its a world stage today for any political leader
6092841 it was an error of me to give the donation and it was an error that it was accepted
6092842 consistently review our procedures to make sure that we are taking every reasonable step to ensure that the contributions we receive are appropriate and follow fec guidelines and we will do so again in light of this new information
6092843 were always looking for ways to best comply with all provisions of campaign finance regulations and obviously take swift action anytime flags are raised regarding potentially problematic campaign contributions
6092844 because i could see it wasnt going anywhere if i didnt do that
6092845 i wouldnt give up because i believe in the man i really do
6092846 maybe i just feel he can put a smile back on the face of the world

6092848 gloomy market conditions have not dampened consumers appetite for shopping online sales continue to show strong growth particularly when compared to the tough trading conditions on the high street
6092849 despite the doom and gloom on the high street and a summer which has killed sandal sales our web sales are still growing at over 30 percent year on year the internet is becoming ever more important as a location to find quality products not available in every town
6092850 it is a taboo subject in defence which apparently hasnt learned anything since vietnam
6092851 well eat your heart out melbourne nowhere to be found
6092852 new york london theyre our competition not melbourne not brisbane
6092853 given that sydney hasnt attracted any major new hotels in recent years i suppose they can chalk this up as a win
6092854 its just a pity that the hotel will be small red and plastic
6092855 we think its better to be named the most liveable city in australia rather than getting a place on a board game
6092856 i think most victorians find this whole melbourne sydney rivalry quite boring really although it seems to have made premier iemmas day
6092857 if i was premier iemma id be more concerned that more australians and presumably sydneysiders voted for melbourne than sydney
6092858 this community will be discussing what measures will be taken in response to the contempt for democracy that has been reflected in the position by bainimarama
6092859 i think this is a direct and deliberate slight and snub to the leaders of the pacific island countries assembled here in niue we will be discussing today and tomorrow the forum countries reaction to that
6092860 the challenge for us in these meetings is to uphold and stand firmly behind that principle of democracy
6092861 therefore that means holding to account those who violate that principle
6092862 it seems very like the dance we went through with zimbabwe at the commonwealth where eventually as the commonwealth stuck to its guns and its charter and the harare declaration mr mugabe left rather than face his peers
6092863 accidents take a huge toll on families our communities and the economy
6092864 thats why the black spot program is a vital element in the governments plan to improve road safety

6092883 one of the most talented officers i have known in twenty two years of service in the army

6092888 sun is a large ship in mid turn and its low share price technology and customers could make it an attractive target to some larger players
6092889 people are starting to look at hey is this a takeout candidate
6092890 theres a definite value in the technology that sun owns theres a ton of intellectual property
6092891 whenever people ask what is suns future then obviously the potential to be acquired comes in
6092892 i could be wrong but i think management is far more focused on fixing the business rather than selling the company
6092893 we are making changes to deliver consistent and expanding profitability
6092894 although the last two quarters were tough for sun we continue to see great progress
6092895 operationally i think sun is going down the right path but i just dont think the growth is being seen as quickly as investors want to see it
6092896 thats been out there for ages at least for the past decade
6092897 there is no doubt that the companys technology talent customer base and brand still command respect in the industry

6092908 tailored to their strengths it happens all the time the rep that you are firing needs to know that not just because its an ego boost but because its true
6092909 the polls show 25 percent of her supporters have not gotten on board
6092910 hes got to be very concerned by the neck in neck polls and by what happened at saddleback
6092911 over the last week weve seen sen obamas lead in the poll of polls cut in half
6092912 this change was likely driven by a renewed focus on foreign policy after russias invasion of georgia as well as by sen mccains willingness to launch more aggressive attacks against obama on issues such as off shore drilling
6092913 since obama returned from his overseas trip it seems like mccain has thrown all the punches clearly the blows have landed in recent days obama is fighting back going after mccain on the economy the issue voters care about most mccain has changed the dynamic of the race heading into the two conventions that puts more pressure on obama to go to denver and effectively define himself and mccain

6092948 tidak ada batasan cinta yang lebih jelas daripada kata cinta itu sendiri
6092949 pokok tauhid dan inti sarinya ialah ikhlas dan cinta kepada alloh semata
6092950 didalam hati manusia ada rasa cinta terhadap sesuatu yang ia sembah dan ia ibadahi ini merupakan tonggak untuk tegak dan kokohnya hati seseorang serta baiknya jiwa mereka
6092951 sesungguh nya orang yang mencintai sesuatu akan mendapatkan lezatnya cinta manakala yang ia cintai itu bisa membuat lupa dari musibah yang menimpanya
6092952 bahwa ia merupakan sebab yang paling kuat untuk bisa bersabar sehingga tidak menyelisihi dan bermaksiat kepada nya
6092953 maka seorang yang tulus dalam cintanya ia akan merasa diawasi oleh yang dicintainya yang selalu menyertai hati dan raganya dan diantara tanda cinta yang tulus ialah ia merasa terus menerus kehadiran kekasihnya yang mengawasi perbuatannya thariqul hijratain hal 449 450
6092954 antara cinta dan perasaan was was terdapat perbe daan dan pertentangan yang besar sebagaimana perbedaan antara ingat dan lalai maka cinta yang menghujam di hati akan menghilangkan keragu raguan terhadap yang dicintainya
6092955 adapun mencintai rabb subhannahu wa taala maka keadaannya tidaklah sama dengan keadaan mencin tai selain nya karena tidak ada yang paling dicintai hati selain pencipta dan pengaturnya dialah sesembahannya yang diibadahi walinya rabb nya pengaturnya pemberi rizkinya yang mematikan dan menghidupkannya
6092956 maka alloh akan mendatangkan satu kaum yang alloh mencintai mereka dan merekapun mencintai alloh

6092983 i think this is a direct and deliberate slight and snub to the leaders of the pacific island countries assembled here in niue
6092984 the challenge for us in these meetings is to uphold and stand firmly behind that principle of democracy
6092985 what im hearing from others whove been to fiji is that the commodore is not just baulking at the commitment for march 2009
6092986 there is no timetable for 2009 2010 2012 or any other time
6092987 let me place on record that the commitments that commodore bainimarama made at the leaders retreat were not forced on him as some have claimed
6092988 pacific island countries are saying to the countries of the world that the time for action concrete action over climate change is now

6092992 i have never suggested and never will that senator mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics and personal ambition
6092993 i have not suggested it because i believe he genuinely wants to serve americas national interests now it is time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country i love america so do you and so does john mccain
6092994 even in retrospect he would choose the path of failure for america over the path of success and victory
6092995 in short both candidates in this election have pledged to end this war and bring our troops home the great difference is that i intend to win it first
6092996 the reason why conventions still matter is because millions of voters are distracted they are busy
6092997 a convention is a wonderful opportunity for both parties to tele scope into just four days their major arguments on behalf of their candidate and their party
6092998 we are working alongside the pakistani and provincial governments to get emergency aid to those in need
6092999 displaced by the fighting survive until it is safe for them to return to their homes
6093000 the taliban took him along forcibly for fighting or he is consumed in the indiscriminate bombing in our area
6093001 its the beginning so at this stage the situation is under control
6093002 but as the number of these people is increasing there could be needs
6093003 americas best days might be ahead of us long term but because of the damage done by the bush administration the next few years are going to hurt
6093004 the mccain team has constructed a persona that can attack at will but can never be attacked they have used mccains pow history to create a firewall to shield him from all criticism and as a universal qualifier for all things that pertain to foreign policy or to the military
6093005 we have already informed the us led coalition naval forces who have dispatched a warship to intercept the tanker believed to be heading towards somalian waters
6093006 this is the fourth ship being hijacked in a month in the waters
6093007 we call upon the un and the international community to take immediate steps to stop the worsening security situation in these waters
6093008 the ship has 39 crew of which 29 are malaysians and 10 filipinos
6093009 their idols are like scarecrows in a cucumber field and they cannot speak they have to be carried for they cannot walk do not be afraid of them for they cannot do evil neither is it in them to do good

6093023 new drilling has to be part of our energy solution it will not solve this problem alone alternative energy will not solve this problem alone conservation will not solve this problem alone solving our energy crisis requires an all of the above approach
6093024 it will require aggressive development of alternative energies like wind solar tidal and biofuels it also requires expanding traditional sources of energy like clean coal nuclear power and offshore drilling like that done on this rig
6093025 what i love about the amazing development of men expanded 2nd edition is that it is an intimate conversation chock full of information and goodies about men and why they do what they do

6093120 it took me four hours the other day to get home all because of the bumpy roads slowing down traffic from maharani bagh through moolchand and south extension till dhaula kuan is in really bad shape my car never goes beyond the 2nd gear
6093121 the roads condition is just pathetic a flyover is coming up and the adjoining road is just boulders and stones and even here in malviya nagar you can see the shape of things
6093122 the quality of material used is not very good specially the proportion of bitumen used is very less and so the base of the road is very weak the road therefore cannot bear the burden of the heavy volume of traffic besides waterlogging is the worst enemy of roads the sewage system is very bad there is too much waterlogging and that causes the maximum damage cemented roads cost more but have a much better quality
6093123 the government might say that they cant repair the roads while it rains we can and we will we have 35 mobile squads in place to help finish the work faster

6093185 what government should be focused on is raising the incomes and the aspirations and the opportunities for the millions of people who are stuck on low incomes and that is where this government has failed not because they are bad people not because they dont have noble ambitions but because their measure which is entirely reliant on the state which is about redistribution has failed failed on their own terms
6093186 our education system is failing to spread opportunity our welfare system is keeping people out of work our tax system makes it extremely difficult for those on low incomes to get off those low incomes because those marginal tax rates are so high
6093187 labour has failed it has created a more unfair society and i think there is a real opportunity for the conservative party now to lead this debate
6093188 we will keep tax credits but we will add to the battle on poverty other things like welfare reform like extending educational opportunity like supporting families and these conservative methods of achieving progressive goals are likely to be far more successful and create a fairer society
6093189 at the moment borrowing is rising and thats a real issue
6093190 george osbornes restaurant has a menu without prices there is something for everyone but no one has to pay
6093191 what passes for conservative policy is nothing but a series of hopelessly vague ambitions
6093192 they would rather repeatedly tell us that we are broken than say what they would do to fix things the only genuine policy they have is a tax break for the richest 6 of people
6093193 its time for the conservatives to realise that power must be earned not inherited and to start setting out some serious policies
6093194 if this is the best the tories can do to claim they are a party of fairness then the labour party is delighted that the battle will be joined on this issue
6093195 george osbornes speech shows we are fighting a tory party that for all the talk of change is still committed to the old unfair policies
6093196 george osborne offers empty rhetoric on child poverty now but people will remember that this is the same shadow chancellor whose flagship tax policy diverts 1bn to the 3 000 richest estates in the country
6093197 and this is the same tory party that opposed the minimum wage opposed pension credit and the winter fuel allowance opposed support for families through tax credits and still wont commit to any real pledge on child poverty

6093249 weve had silver before we dont want silver anymore we are going for the gold and well get it it doesnt matter who we are playing brazil or argentina we want the gold and we have the players to get it
6093250 i told you that we were changing players trying to get some balance in the team you saw how rough it was in the first two to three matches now we are getting somewhere we are striking some rhythm and the boys are determined
6093251 well i dont have much to say i can only say bravo to the players they are wonderful guys scoring four goals in the semi final of the olympic soccer event is wonderful i commend them
6093252 i dont want to compare the two sides i can only say that the atlanta team had great players who had experience and here i have great players who are young and determined they have done well and gold is within reach we cant go without it we are ready to play against any team
6093253 he had worked so hard and i wanted to allow him some rest before i knew what was happening he scored that great goal
6093254 if you have good players you can change at will we kept changing to find the balance now we are getting somewhere that place is where the gold is
6093255 we watched their games and found out about their left midfielder and what he does with the ball so we took care of him he moussa is fast on the break and good in taking chances we played sani kaita on him and that worked

6093292 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now
6093293 that hairline difference between nuance and what appears to be flip flopping is hurting him with liberal voters
6093294 conservatives were supposed to be the bigger problem for mccain
6093295 obama still has work to do on his base at this point mccain seems to be doing a better job with his
6093296 there were no wild swings there isnt one group that is radically different than last month or even two months ago it was just a steady decline for obama across the board

6093298 this is an exciting announcement and there is a great deal of synergy between the two brands the demonstrated ability to be able to predict and be prepared for future market trends along with the fact that we have both won awards that have been chosen by our users rather than a judging panel
6093299 to get the chance to partner with such a globally renowned brand such as paypal not only demonstrates how far kashflow has come as a business but also speaks volumes about the team behind the company and of whom i am immensely proud
6093300 we are delighted to have partnered with kashflow who like paypal have a strong foothold in the sme market and offer paypal a great way to reach a significant audience
6093301 enabling small businesses to link directly to paypal accounts at the click of a button not only offers convenience but helps safeguard against sales data being lost or entered incorrectly due to human error in addition a number of smes that use kashflow are also paypal customers saving business a huge amount of time
6093302 this is the first time in many many years there has been such a major social housing development programme which will be constructed over the next three years
6093303 so there is an opportunity out there for the development of the construction industry in northern ireland
6093304 there is a positive message from the department of social development and we are working on priming the construction industry
6093305 none of us have any control over the global credit crunch and the correction of the economy
6093306 this will be a good example of shared future housing when developed which is very important for sustainable communities and sustaining the construction industry the local economy and making lives better

6093330 el rubro de confecciones es b sicamente exportador y si el a o pasado exportamos us 1 040 millones eso significa que el aporte del sector al pbi es de 1 3 si el sector como hemos proyectado no crece este a o la contribuci n al pbi ser de 1 y no de 1 3 este a o
6093331 en los primeros meses el sector creci a tasas bajas pero creci sin embargo el escenario empez a modificarse sobre todo durante los ltimos dos meses hoy es evidente que la gente prefiere priorizar la compra de alimentos y combustibles y sacrificar todo lo que es prendas y calzado
6093332 los clientes est n empezando a presionar para que los precios de algunas prendas que siempre han tenido precios altos disminuyan
6093333 pese a la ca da de ee uu las exportaciones de confecciones crecieron 6 por el efecto venezuela no obstante si persisten los problemas de pago estas podr an caer y arrastrar a todas las exportaciones por eso es necesario ponerle atenci n al tema de ee uu

6093359 we have things lined up to do on my days home with the girls
6093360 what government should be focused on is raising the incomes and the aspirations and the opportunities for the millions of people who are stuck on low incomes and that is where this government has failed not because they are bad people not because they dont have noble ambitions but because their measure which is entirely reliant on the state which is about redistribution has failed failed on their own terms
6093361 our education system is failing to spread opportunity our welfare system is keeping people out of work our tax system makes it extremely difficult for those on low incomes to get off those low incomes because those marginal tax rates are so high
6093362 labour has failed it has created a more unfair society and i think there is a real opportunity for the conservative party now to lead this debate
6093363 we will keep tax credits but we will add to the battle on poverty other things like welfare reform like extending educational opportunity like supporting families and these conservative methods of achieving progressive goals are likely to be far more successful and create a fairer society
6093364 at the moment borrowing is rising and thats a real issue
6093365 george osbornes restaurant has a menu without prices there is something for everyone but no one has to pay
6093366 what passes for conservative policy is nothing but a series of hopelessly vague ambitions
6093367 they would rather repeatedly tell us that we are broken than say what they would do to fix things the only genuine policy they have is a tax break for the richest 6 of people
6093368 its time for the conservatives to realise that power must be earned not inherited and to start setting out some serious policies
6093369 if this is the best the tories can do to claim they are a party of fairness then the labour party is delighted that the battle will be joined on this issue
6093370 george osbornes speech shows we are fighting a tory party that for all the talk of change is still committed to the old unfair policies
6093371 george osborne offers empty rhetoric on child poverty now but people will remember that this is the same shadow chancellor whose flagship tax policy diverts 1bn to the 3 000 richest estates in the country
6093372 and this is the same tory party that opposed the minimum wage opposed pension credit and the winter fuel allowance opposed support for families through tax credits and still wont commit to any real pledge on child poverty

6093394 sterreich hat damals die grenze ge ffnet f r die menschen die keine perspektive in tschechoslowakei mehr sahen
6093395 es ist nur engagierten vertretern wie rudolf kirchschl ger als botschafter oder medienvertretern wie helmut zilk oder gerd bacher zu verdanken dass sterreich auch in dieser phase seine rolle als neutraler staat aktiv wahrgenommen hat und durch konkrete taten zur hilfe f r die betroffenen menschen beigetragen hat und rudolf kirchschl ger hat mit seiner weigerung die weisung keine visa mehr auszustellen klar gezeigt dass auch ein neutraler staat in solchen situation nicht parteifrei sein kann und darf sondern auf der seite des historischen rechts zu stehen hat

6093417 i have personally no score to settle with mr musharraf frankly although he left no stone unturned to humiliate me and my family arrest me handcuff me tied to the seat of a plane and kept me in solitary confinement and then send me into exile for seven long years
6093418 but i have no personal vendetta frankly and i am not a man who would ever take any revenge on personal grounds and now that hes gone i would hate to say anything against him frankly
6093419 but i am really disturbed i think its very tragic that someone who imposes martial law abrogates the constitution twice in the last seven years arrests the judges sacks them puts them under house arrest doesnt allow their children to even go out to school and then humiliates them not only that he abrogates and subverts the constitution but also dissolves the parliament sends them home
6093420 i think how long can the country can afford all these things
6093421 somebody must answer these questions and somebody must be held accountable for these blunders one commits
6093422 im dismayed and disappointed this would be the third breach of our trust between the two of us and i think that would be very tragic if that happens

6093424 it is not a threat it is a noble cause
6093425 my relations with america are fine my only difference with the present administration is that they have been supporting a dictator against 170 million people in the country
6093426 they have been supporting one individual who was wearing uniform who was a usurper who happened to be a dictator and who was responsible for overturning a government

6093436 its unclear if this will be the first time obama appears with his running mate
6093437 the mystery of who that running mate will be has created a media frenzy with rampant speculation does it mean anything that obama today praised the national security leadership qualities of one senator in his speech to veterans
6093438 im proud to join my friend senator joe biden in calling for an additional one billion dollars in reconstruction assistance for the people of georgia
6093439 remains shrouded in secrecy leaving him the option of making known his selection at any point this week some campaign insiders are known to favor

6093442 it is true that no one was forced to participate in the saddleback civil forum on the presidency and that both mccain and obama are free agents warren has a right to invite whomever he wishes to his church and to ask them whatever theyre willing to answer
6093443 his format and questions were interesting and the answers more revealing than what the usual debate menu provides
6093444 the past few decades of public confession and oprah style therapy have prepared us perfectly for a televangelist probing politicians about their moral failings warrens q amp a wasnt an inquisition exactly but viewers would be justified in squirming
6093445 what is the right answer after all what happens to the one who gets evil wrong whats a proper relationship with jesus whats next interrogations by rabbis priests and imams what candidate would dare decline on the basis of mere principle
6093446 jesus christ died for my sins and i am redeemed through him
6093447 what does that mean anyway what does it prove nothing except that these men are willing to say whatever they must and what most americans personally feel is no ones business to win the highest office

6093485 damit hat sich auch f r viele millionen menschen die hoffnung auf freiheit selbstbestimmung und gerecht verteilten wohlstand zerschlagen
6093486 gerade f r die zeit nach dem gewaltfreien systemwechsel nach 1989 gilt es auch die europ ische union als wichtiges friedensprojekt hervorzuheben
6093487 denn es ist in kurzer zeit gelungen viele staaten mittel und osteuropas die einst teil des ostblocks waren in das europ ische projekt zu integrieren und damit f r ein friedliches demokratisches zusammenwachsen der teile europas zu sorgen und den menschen in diesen l ndern mit der europ ischen perspektive neue chancen zu bieten

6093517 obviously you have to find a way to bowl some dots against him and build a bit of pressure because he is one of the worlds best if not the best at the moment
6093518 he has got all the shots and new ones i see it as a challenge because no one else out there does it so i would like to see what i do if he does it
6093519 we have had a few chats and some of the senior guys have an idea what i should do if he moves late you cannot do anything if the ball has already left your hand
6093520 if he does move early you maybe could pull out but i suppose it is also a good opportunity for a wicket if you get it right if he is totally turning around then his head is moving

6093526 on this issue we fully support russia georgia started this crisis but the west is blaming russia
6093527 the war which was triggered in georgia is the culmination of attempts to encircle and isolate russia
6093528 of course military and technical cooperation is the main issue weapons purchases are very important
6093529 i think we should speed it up moreover the west and israel continue to put pressure on russia

6093547 wer erreichen will dass russland seine truppen umgehend aus dem georgischen kerngebiet zur ckzieht muss den dialog mit russland intensivieren statt ihn einzufrieren

6093549 ich appelliere an die bundesregierung die besonderen deutsch russischen beziehungen nicht zu gef hrden die beziehungen zwischen russland und deutschland haben f r ganz europa eine besondere qualit t die regierungen russlands und deutschlands haben daf r den begriff einer strategischen partnerschaft gew hlt strategische partnerschaften sind keine angelegenheit f r sch n wetter phasen sondern m ssen sich in krisensituationen bew hren in diesem zusammenhang ist es falsch im weltsicherheitsrat berraschend eine tiefgehende berarbeitung des vereinbarten 6 punkte planes zu russland vorzulegen der weltsicherheitsrat ist dadurch blockiert der weltsicherheitsrat muss handlungsf hig werden das macht eine r ckkehr zu dem von frankreich vermittelten 6 punkte plan notwendig die nato muss sich aus dem georgien konflikt heraushalten gefordert ist nicht die nato sondern die osze die osze k nnte ihre aufgabe frieden zu vermitteln und zu stabilisieren endlich wahrnehmen wenn sie dazu in die lage versetzt wird die osze sollte m glichst rasch eine untersuchungskommission nach georgien entsenden eine solche kommission muss fakten zur humanit ren lage zusammentragen und ebenfalls klarheit ber gravierende menschenrechtsverletzungen w hrend des krieges schaffen die deutsche bundesregierung muss aufkl ren wie deutsche waffen nach georgien gekommen sind wenn es denn stimmt dass die daf r zust ndigen gremien keine exportgenehmigung erteilt haben
6093550 tats chlich herrscht im bereich der pflege in krankenh usern akuter handlungsbedarf w hrend die zahl der besch ftigten rzte und rztinnen steigt wird seit jahren das personal das t glich die kranken menschen pflegt und betreut abgebaut die arbeitsbedingungen sind heute auf vielen stationen unertr glich und nicht l nger hinnehmbar

6093552 wir gr ne wollen eine integrierte versorgung von ambulanten und station ren rztlichen und pflegerischen leistungen bei der die patienten im mittelpunkt stehen dadurch ergeben sich viele m gliche synergieeffekte f r eine bessere patientenversorgung es wird zeit dass sich eine landesregierung hier endlich engagiert und gemeinsam mit den krankenh usern wege hin zu einer bedarfsgerechten pflege aufzeigt

6093565 seit 18 jahren warten die ostdeutschen rentnerinnen und rentner vergeblich auf die angleichung ihrer renten an das westniveau jetzt endlich scheint bewegung in die sache zu kommen ob es der spd mann sellring wirklich ernst meint bleibt abzuwarten
6093566 grunds tzlich begr t die linke den vorsto sellrings f r eine gemeinsame bundesratsinitiative zur angleichung der unterschiedlichen rentenwerte in ost und west umso unverst ndlicher ist es dass die bundesregierung lediglich aufgefordert werden soll vorschl ge zur erarbeiten wie m glichst schnell die rentenwerte in ost und west deutschland angeglichen werden k nnten die linke hat in der vergangenheit immer wieder die beendigung der rentenungerechtigkeit zwischen ost und west gefordert und bereits im oktober 2006 einen eigenen vorschlag zur schnellstm glichen angleichung des rentenwerts ost an west dem bundestag zur beratung vorgelegt danach soll der r ckstand beim rentenwert ost von 12 1 prozent durch steuerfinanzierte zuschl ge ausgeglichen werden dies k nnte schrittweise erfolgen ohne dass die erwerbst tigen zus tzlich belastet werden auch von den ver di und den sozialverb nden gibt es bereits seit l ngerem hnliche vorschl ge der verdacht liegt daher nahe dass es sich bei sellrings vorsto lediglich um einen eigenen profilierungsversuch innerhalb der spd handelt wer es wirklich ernst mit der beendigung der rentenungerechtigkeit meint der bel sst es nicht bei blo en ank ndigungen sondern handelt zu hoffen bleibt dass die ostdeutschen rentnerinnen und rentner nicht weiter bis zum sankt nimmerleinstag vertr stet werden

6093572 mit der mahnwache mitten im stadtteil moorburg will robin wood am wochenende seinen protest gegen das von vattenfall geplante klimasch dliche steinkohlekraftwerk verst rken es ist ein skandal dass nun die finanzbeh rde des gr n schwarzen senats f r die mahnwache die nutzung der bestens geeigneten fl che an der schule verweigert und damit den protest gegen das klimasch dliche kraftwerk zu behindern versucht
6093573 die weigerung der finanzbeh rde eine ffentliche fl che f r eine mahnwache bereit zu stellen ist eine massive einschr nkung der grundgesetzlich gesch tzten versammlungsfreiheit
6093574 eine genehmigung f r das kohlekraftwerk in moorburg w re ein schwerer r ckschlag f r den dringend erforderlichen klimaschutz
6093575 3 700 zus tzliche lkw stellpl tze in f nf jahren davon profitieren pkw und lkw fahrer
6093576 wir wollen in f nf jahren 3 700 zus tzliche lkw stellpl tze bereit stellen von dem ehrgeizigen ziel profitieren die lkw fahrer und auch die brigen autofahrer die lkw fahrer finden leichter einen geeigneten stellplatz um die gesetzlich vorgeschriebenen ruhezeiten einzuhalten dies dient unser aller verkehrssicherheit und die pkw fahrer k nnen in der nacht wieder in die rastanlagen einfahren ohne dass sie durch oftmals verbotswidrig abgestellte lkw behindert oder gar gef hrdet werden
6093577 wenn alles gut l uft und hier meine ich insbesondere die planfeststellungsverfahren sollte es m glich sein innerhalb der n chsten f nf jahre auf unbewirtschafteten rastanlagen rund 1 500 zus tzliche stellpl tze zu schaffen
6093578 hier haben wir wegen mancher einspr che von anwohnern und kommunen in der regel zwar den zeitlich und personell gr ten planungsaufwand daf r stehen aber nach umsetzung der ma nahmen den lkw fahrern die qualitativ besten stellpl tze zur verf gung denn neben dem stellplatz k nnen sie auch ein umfangreiches serviceangebot nutzen
6093579 hin und wieder anzutreffende fundamentale ablehnungen k nnen und d rfen aber nicht zum erfolg f hren hier appelliere ich an alle auch f r die derzeitige unertr gliche situation der lkw fahrer und damit f r den notwendigen aus und neubau mehr verst ndnis aufzubringen
6093580 im hinblick auf den weiter stark steigenden schwerverkehr k nnen nicht alle notwendigen lkw stellpl tze an den autobahnen bereit gestellt werden wir brauchen deshalb eine verst rkte zusammenarbeit mit den autoh fen
6093581 dazu bieten wir den autoh fen die sich an einer erweiterungsaktion beteiligten eine verbesserte hinweisbeschilderung an der autobahn auf ihren autohof an bei den autoh fen k nnen kurzfristig etwa 500 zus tzliche stellpl tze gebaut werden zusammen mit einer besseren ausnutzung vorhandener freien kapazit ten rechnen wir in den n chsten f nf jahren mit mindestens 1 000 zus tzlich nutzbaren stellpl tzen bei den autoh fen
6093582 dies wird die derzeitige berlastung der rastanlagen an den autobahnen deutlich entsch rfen
6093583 der zugewinnausgleich wird im grundsatz beibehalten weil er f r einen fairen und praxistauglichen ausgleich sorgt mit dem vorgelegten reformentwurf wollen wir einige schwachstellen beseitigen und damit noch besser sicherstellen dass die teilung wirklich gerecht ist
6093584 unredliche verm gensverschiebungen zu lasten des ehegatten der einen ausgleichsanspruch hat sollen k nftig besser verhindert werden au erdem muss ber cksichtigt werden ob ein ehepartner bereits mit schulden in die ehe gegangen ist die tilgung dieser schulden muss ber cksichtigt werden der rechtliche rahmen f r ehe lebenspartnerschaften und familie muss auf der h he der zeit sein und den bed rfnissen der menschen entsprechen

6093590 mit der gewaltt tigen niederschlagung des prager fr hlings vor 40 jahren durch sowjetische truppen wurde auch auf jahre die hoffnung niedergewalzt dass f r die staaten osteuropas eine friedliche abkehr vom weg des stalinismus und der moskauh rigkeit m glich sein k nnte
6093591 damit hat sich auch f r viele millionen menschen die hoffnung auf freiheit selbstbestimmung und gerecht verteilten wohlstand zerschlagen
6093592 gerade f r die zeit nach dem gewaltfreien systemwechsel nach 1989 gilt es auch die europ ische union als wichtiges friedensprojekt hervorzuheben denn es ist in kurzer zeit gelungen viele staaten mittel und osteuropas die einst teil des ostblocks waren in das europ ische projekt zu integrieren und damit f r ein friedliches demokratisches zusammenwachsen der teile europas zu sorgen und den menschen in diesen l ndern mit der europ ischen perspektive neue chancen zu bieten
6093593 es ist nur engagierten vertretern wie rudolf kirchschl ger als botschafter oder medienvertretern wie helmut zilk oder gerd bacher zu verdanken dass sterreich auch in dieser phase seine rolle als neutraler staat aktiv wahrgenommen hat und durch konkrete taten zur hilfe f r die betroffenen menschen beigetragen hat und rudolf kirchschl ger hat mit seiner weigerung die weisung keine visa mehr auszustellen klar gezeigt dass auch ein neutraler staat in solchen situation nicht parteifrei sein kann und darf sondern auf der seite des historischen rechts zu stehen hat

6093685 all of a sudden from the fifth avenue side a huge number of police officers entered 56th street
6093686 the protest was on the south side of the street we were standing on the north side of the street they came directly to us they were in riot gear and they surrounded us they made a semicircle around us shoulder to shoulder with their batons
6093687 then they started arresting us one by one at that point i got emotional i could not believe in my country in my city i could get arrested for doing absolutely nothing and standing on the sidewalk
6093688 this settlement was reached without any admission of liability on behalf of the city and the individual defendants

6093697 the iraq war was the most serious hoax on the american people but it was preceded by the push to deploy anti missile weapons after the attack of september 11 president bush used that tragedy to increase spending for anti missile systems and to pull out of the anti ballistic missile treaty the fact that terrorists dont have missiles and that the attacks had nothing whatsoever to do with the anti missile systems didnt matter the tactic worked the democrats in congress folded least they look weak 60 billion and several broken treaties later we still dont have an anti missile weapon that works and osama bin laden is cavorting safely in northern pakistan they are at it again this time using the russia georgia conflict to justify a project they fear is slipping away for the past two years the administration has been insisting that the weapons were aimed at iran not russia suddenly the line has shifted led by senator john mccain whose foreign policy seems to have been completely captured by the neoconservatives they have left one dying host to infect another
6093698 the us does not need a rush to deploy a technology that doesnt work against a threat that doesnt exist
6093699 the senate and the house armed services committees have wisely restricted any funding for missile systems in poland or the czech republic until both parliaments approve the plan and the proposed weapons pass realistic operational tests republicans may try to strike that language from the bill in the senate this september this is a test for the democrats are they strong enough to stand by their convictions will they expose this placebo defense and the hypocrites who push it or will we see the traditional democratic dive on defense september will tell us a great deal about whether the new obama led party is serious about charting a new course
6093700 this is not just about missile defense this is about demonstrating to russia that america is still a nation of resolve and were not going to let russian expansionism intimidate everyone

6093718 there are many books so fine in point of matter and make up that we should lament having been born too late to read these in our childhood but there are also a multitude of potboiler books the written to order information book which may be guaranteed to kill all interest in a subject treated in style so wooden and lifeless the re told classic the reading of which gives to the child the familiarity which will breed contempt for the work itself atrocious picture books with hideous daubs of color caricatures of line the tale of the practical joker who torments animals mocks at physical defects plays tricks on parents ridicules good manners whose aim is to provoke guffaws of laughter at the expense of somebodys hurt body or spirit
6093719 the great achievement of the world do not belong to those to whom they are entrusted but some frank or jack or bill possesses the brain behind them many of these stories are outlined by a writer whose name makes books sell and outlines are then filled in by hack writers one author writes admirable stories abounding in fair play and a sense of honor and at the same time writes under another name books he is ashamed to acknowledge
6093720 two principle arguments are hurled at every librarian who tries for a high standard of book selection one is i read them when i was a child and they did me no harm the other is based on the notion that the librarians ideal of manhood is a grownup fauntleroy the individual who argues it did me no harm though he survived a boyhood of mosquito bites house flies common drinking cups etc refuses to allow his child to risk what he knows to be a possible carrier of disease the notion prevails that since the childrens librarian is a woman and is prone to turn white about the gills at the sight of blood she cannot possibly enter in to the feeling of the ancestral barbarians surviving in the human breast

6093799 database archiving often fails to get the attention it needs compared to other critical activities related to production databases and data warehouses
6093800 an archival system becomes critical when you need to access archived information in response to a legal summons customer service issue security investigation or technical issue the value of archiving grows considerably as it becomes easier to access the archived data
6093801 with legal demands for access growing conventional approaches to database archiving are increasingly being found lacking they focus on lifting and shifting inactive data from production databases to improve application performance without considering how to optimize the way archived data is stored get your archiving right and you reduce storage costs and guarantee simple future proofed access get it wrong and at worst you could face prison
6093802 why database archiving should be part of your dbms strategy
6093803 it managers need to achieve a balance between the compliance demands for retention and the business demand for economical storage and retrieval current database management system technology is optimised for transactional processing data warehouses are optimised for analytics but both fail to adequately address archiving needs worse still the lines between archive stores and backup which have very different drivers and requirements are all too often blurred
6093804 forresters research clearly illustrates the need for the new generation of archive stores these deliver both massive reductions in storage footprints through data compression together with the security immutability and point in time query capability that enables quick simple and unimpeachable fulfilment of regulatory obligations

6093841 after lots of complaints about iphone 3g connection issues apple released a firmware update monday with hopes it would fix the issues but early reports suggest it
6093842 why do you think its true that those who have been adopted by earthly parents often display unusual insight into vertical spiritual adoption
6093843 not flesh of my flesh nor bone of my bone but still miraculously my own never forget for a single minute you didnt grow under my heart but in it
6093844 gives me an unusual ability to understand my adoption into gods arms my parents had no idea whether i would be a boy or girl they wanted me regardless of my gender god also loves us irrespective of gender knowing that they loved me before i was born deepens my gratitude that god knew me and chose me before the foundation of the world
6093845 my adoptive parents chose to ignore my impoverished past the fact that my natural mother was on welfare didnt diminish their love for me likewise god knows our wicked past our spiritual impoverishment down to the smallest disgusting detail yet he loves us anyway to have been twice adopted and loved in this way goes beyond any words in my vocabulary
6093846 for all intents and purposes whatsoever the said child is and is hereby declared to be in the same relationship to the petitioners the adoptive parents as if born to them by natural birth and remaining in such relationship as if the child were their own
6093847 the rights of all other persons if any they have to the care control and custody of said child be and the same are hereby forever and finally terminated
6093848 these words can be used to describe gods adoption of me into his family when i was adopted by my earthly parents my old identity was terminated legally speaking anyway i became a new and different person i became mary jane fox when i was adopted by my heavenly father i also left behind my old self and was reborn with a new identity a clean slate a fresh start
6093849 she is so fragile and vulnerable she stumbles and falls and whines and often makes such a mess of things but thats the way we are with god every day i stumble and fall and mess things up but my father is there to pick me up he comforts me when im down i complain and get into trouble yet he gently corrects me and loves me in a way that overshadows even the best of earthly affections
6093850 behold behold what manner of love the father has for us that we should be called the children of god and thats exactly what we are

6093876 is that our red post box or is it a real one
6093877 i usually give you all one or two tone words when we have a meeting like this but if i were to give you two words this time they would be euros lyn
6093878 more than ever before this series of torchwood will be director led and it will look absolutely amazing
6093879 today 20 august is the first dry day weve had in a couple of weeks
6093880 weve had a hell of a lot of rain and in some cases the wheat is literally under water
6093881 travelling on the land is going to be a problem
6093882 the flora and fauna around us are shifting over time due to climate change
6093883 the result is desynchronisation if birds and the insects on which they depend do not react in the same way we are headed for an upheaval in the interaction between species
6093884 at any one site the community of birds you find there has changed over time
6093885 now more of the species that are found in warmer climates are occurring but that change is not occurring as fast as the change in temperature is
6093886 some species have changed their range hugely over the past two decades
6093887 for example the buzzard one of our biggest birds of prey 20 years ago was restricted to the west of britain but has now spread as far east as london
6093888 we all know that the berlin wall is down people should be able to get
6093889 first they ignore you then they laugh at you then they fight you then you win
6093890 what the mortality rate does is give you an entree to talk to your doctor and say look is this hospital stay going to kill me
6093891 the problem with the cms data is that most hospitals look average which isnt what employers want what they want is to compare hospitals
6093892 when your numbers arent what you like them to be its not because you didnt have the same patients as the hospital across the street
6093893 its because you didnt do as well as you could with the hand you were dealt
6093894 this is turning the lights on for providers of care as well
6093895 doctors and hospitals cant decide to do better unless they know how theyre doing
6093896 if we fall back a bit or if were not making progress
6093897 they want to know what were going to do about it
6093898 theres no one thing that determines whether you save a life
6093899 we learned that if we lock down our elevators when we know a patients coming we can save three or four minutes
6093900 this was a signal that we have to be responsible for patients after theyve left our halls
6093901 data source localhost initial catalog pruebas user id sa password 12456789
6093902 a descendant of mine other than a child of mine who marries outside the jewish faith unless the spouse of such descendant has converted or converts within one year of the marriage to the jewish faith and his or her descendants shall be deemed to be deceased for all purposes of this instrument as of the date of such marriage
6093903 its certainly not fair to not let them start before we get through the general plan process
6093904 the great enterprise the manchu reconstruction of imperial order in seventeenth century china
6093905 the trillion dollar meltdown easy money high rollers and the great credit crash
6093906 sarkozy cest le seul qui a t oblig de passer par lelys e pour devenir premier ministre
6093907 police are in the process of conducting interviews to determine what transpired inside the residence leading up to this very tragic incident one male is currently in custody
6093908 doctors dont always agree on a prognosis there is a fair amount of objectivity and there is a certain amount of subjectivity
6093909 as a result of this recommendation it appears that dr rainville would not sign paperwork to support a total and permanent disability claim
6093910 it appears at this point that dc district chief famolare begins to doctor shop
6093911 following that appointment dr mahoney then signs off on dc famolares paperwork declaring him totally disabled
6093912 even if compliance poses an incidental conflict with the defendants religious beliefs
6093913 the issue of speedy trials is one that merits review by the court particularly when delays are outside the control of a prosecutor
6093914 there could be severe consequences if prosecutors are not able to pursue evidence that may assist in obtaining a conviction if a defendant can challenge it and eventually cry foul over the time courts take to determine the outcome of a challenge
6093915 jeffs family im sure jeff everyone is disappointed because we won at the court of appeals and now were starting over
6093916 it doesnt mean that jeff still isnt going to prevail but its just like starting over
6093917 they based that on hearsay from jeffs father that he told some people he was not going to allow jeff to go to pre and post prom
6093918 as an expression of somebody who calls himself a minister of health its a very unhealthy statement
6093919 i mean where does he come off where does he appoint himself as a moral judge of professionals who he doesnt understand and knows nothing about
6093920 is it unethical for health care professionals to support the administration of drugs that are of unknown substance or purity or potency drugs that cannot otherwise be legally prescribed
6093921 so contrary to what mr clement might think were actually encouraging abstinence
6093922 my question to him is how does it affect you on a personal level that you should be so lacking in compassion for people
6093923 people have realized that when addiction touches their own lives in particular they realize that they really need a tool kit to help an addict and it should include injection sites
6093924 i almost feel a certain amount of pity for the guy clement because i think he doesnt seem to grasp just how sophisticated the level of discussion has been thats gone on around ethics
6093925 to just suddenly enter into the level hes entered this and think that he can sway the canadian medical association people with a few comments i think is very naive of him
6093926 too many canadians have seen the ugly face of drug crime
6093927 theyve had junkies break into their homes to fund a quick fix theyve seen young thugs dealing in schoolyards and getting more kids hooked
6093928 we have seen first hand how asbestos has wreaked havoc on americans working in naval shipyards automobile plants and the construction industry most often this is through their employers conscious choice for profits over a workers health
6093929 if a person who has had a stroke can walk across a room i should be able to run 20 miles
6093930 when you run you delve a little deeper into yourself and empathize when they hit their wall and think i just cant do it
6093931 he is aging very gracefully healthy and smart much better than i did at his age he is national class
6093932 its training and leading up to a race for me
6093933 ive always had good pulmonary lung capacity its been my strength its carried me through a lot
6093934 it was kind of half hearted i was not prepared
6093935 i dont know exactly what it was that brought me back
6093936 thats a tough one a buddy of mine got me to run with him in the 2006 tucson 10 miler i did 1 07 and things snowballed from there
6093937 people who cant walk or dress themselves lots of stroke victims amputees hip fractures
6093938 its going to be a different feel because were doing five days
6093939 its not going to change its not a family show were still going to be on after 9pm torchwoods a family show if you think its appropriate for your children to watch it we just deal with issues of life but no its not going to be toned down were still going to be edgy because thats what we are
6093940 gt dropped out to be in the doubtless crappy law and order uk but thats just me now what do you think
6093941 with all due respect to cardiff city theres only so many options in a place of that size for stories compared to a huge city like london
6093942 but how many people are willing to make a commitment to watch something over five consecutive nights these days whats the dramatic point that cant be served by weekly episodes or are they relying on everyone recording it or iplayering it
6093943 we all had some bad news today our good friend leroi moore passed on and gave his ghost up today and we will miss him forever
6093944 i feel like a sore thumb in a piranha pool in this industry i dont like the way its all run by rich men in their 50s who went to private school its not something i want to be part of im going to retire and become a pedal taxi driver
6093945 there will be a lot of stories and a lot of laughs
6093946 our employees have many fond memories of their time at the park back to the point gives them a great reason to catch up with some old friends
6093947 warm bath cold shower new books dive into splendor and politics of the great lakes
6093948 i cant give anything away but this series has a lot of surprises in store for viewers
6093949 eve is great so easy to work with shes lovely and good fun on set but a true professional too
6093950 what makes our job so much easier is that the people of cardiff are so supportive
6093951 the businesses around this area could make things difficult for filming but they are being so cooperative
6093952 is that our red post box or is it a real one

6093954 more than ever before this series of torchwood will be director led and it will look absolutely amazing
6093955 we now have the worst of both worlds not just inflation on the one side or stagnation on the other we have a sort of stagflation situation
6093956 for his achievement in the fields of consumption analysis monetary history and theory and for his demonstration of the complexity of stabilization policy
6093957 in fact they are very much like the rest of mainstream economics while mainstream economists advocate the management of demand supply siders advocate the management of supply
6093958 in the free market economy neither demand nor supply is managed both consumption and production are equally important in the fulfillment of peoples ultimate goal which is the maintenance of life and well being in short consumption is dependent on production while production is dependent on consumption the loose monetary policy of the central bank breaks this unity by creating an environment where it appears that it is possible to consume without production this unity can be restored by bringing back the market selected money gold
6093959 rhodium is used most often for this kind of catalyst and it costs around 9 000 an ounce
6093960 there are many practical issues that need to be resolved before we can use hydrogen as fuel how to make it how to transport it how to create the infrastructure for people to fill their cars with it
6093961 our research lends itself to whats called a distributed production strategy instead of making hydrogen from biofuel at a centralized facility and transporting it to gas stations we could use our catalyst inside reactors that are actually located at the gas stations so we wouldnt have to transport or store the hydrogen we could store the biofuel and make hydrogen on the spot
6093962 when you have a vehicle that runs e85 it can have varying amounts
6093963 you can run gasoline in that car as well as e85
6093964 ethanol is made from organic material you can make it from corn
6093965 i have plenty of space to improvise to try new ideas
6093966 in that era it was australia a small anglo saxon nation among large asian powers wanting to get closer to the much larger anglo saxon power whose western edge was on the same body of water the pacific ocean
6093967 i make it quite clear that australia looks to america free of any pangs as to our traditional links or kinship with the united kingdom

6093971 by allowing beijing to host the games you will help in the development of human rights
6093972 we are convinced that the olympic games will improve human rights in china
6093973 we must make efforts to create a harmonious society and a good social environment for successfully holding the 17th communist party congress and the beijing olympic games we must strike hard at hostile forces at home and abroad such as ethnic separatists and heretical organisations like the falun gong
6093974 if these allegations aretrue it would represent evil the likes of which we have not seen in the world in the last 60 years
6093975 the social composition of their ruling elites is undergoing major transition
6093976 it used to be that they were all engineers in the politburo now you have lawyers and people from commerce and they reflect much more the cultural composition of their society whatever china is becoming it is not going to be a carbon copy of american style democracy they are likely to find their own way on this

6093978 welcome to chilo a planet with corrosive rain crushing pressure and deadly heat fortunately fourteen year old timas lives in one of the domed cities that float 100 000 feet above the surface circling near the edge of a monstrous perpetual storm above the acidic clouds the temperature and pressure are normal but to make a living timas like many other young men is lowered to the surface in an armored suit to scavenge what he can timass life is turned upside down when a strange man crash lands on the city the newcomer is fleeing an alien intelligence intent on invading the planet and discovering the secret hidden deep inside the perpetual storm a secret that could lead to interplanetary war
6093979 start with the truth identify the worldview of the people you need to reach describe the truth through their worldview thats your story when you overreach you always fail not today but sooner or later the truth wins out negative or positive the challenge isnt just to tell the truth its to tell truth that resonates
6093980 peak experiences are great but its the accumulation of mildly positive events that produce lasting happiness
6093981 it is my hope that reading these stories inspires some to plant their own seeds of change that when we see something wrong well do something about it whether that means writing to your representative in congress or researching a cure for a disease or simply speaking out against inequality and prejudice were all in this together and the first step toward change can begin with any one of us
6093982 the heroes of this great artistic labor tend to be semimonastic intro verts who like woods beloved henry james and gustave flaubert toil with the doors shut and locked in soundproof splendid isolation attentive to the subtle frictions among nouns and adjectival phrases
6093983 less humorous and far more hectoring than whats the matter with kansas this volume quickly devolves into a highly partisan manichaean minded screed against conservatives and private sector economics mr frank comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative
6093984 franks portrait of the conservative movement sacrifices complexity to caricature
6093985 with rare exceptions like john kenneth galbraith conservatives have been the best satirists in thomas frank
6093986 the lovers in the gargoyle have the intimacy of roommates who hook up when they get drunk not a time defying passion their thoughts feelings conversations and affections are so unformed so hampered by sentiment and under powered awkwardness that the courage endurance and under standing ascribed to them seem silly davidsons lovers are dysfunctional and quirky qualities that can look a bit like profundity from a distance but they dont have emotional or imaginative depth or range which at the end of the day are the only things that can make a love story deep and wide ranging
6093987 west has made 15 reporting trips to iraq over the last six years and is almost as personally invested in the current conflict as he was in vietnam this book his third on iraq is his attempt to ensure that the endgame in iraq turns out better than in his last war
6093988 sharp as he can be in his judgments he is equally sharp in identifying the virtues of what he doesnt like he gives a spacious view of the countryside whatever the particular road he hews through it he takes his subjects seriously but not himself like snow white you might say
6093989 i read the suicide index with a rapacity bordering on need with tears in my chest and in my eyes occasionally i had to put it down and leave the room more often i devoured it the book is the product of a loving daughters grief and part of her process of grieving but it is also the measured elegant gripping work of a professional writer who has set her powers of observation to work on her own family her parents and grandparents her uncle her sister her husband her son and on herself
6093990 the storys emotional intensity is relentless and all of it light or dark is rendered at the same fever pitch the most consuming love until tomorrow when itll get even better the most consuming pain until tomorrow when itll get even worse bella whose human self is bumbling always blushing and a terrible driver becomes the strongest most beautiful most confident vampire ever jacob who begins the tale impatient and cranky also ends up in a new exalted state it might be unreasonable to expect a young adult vampire romance novel to be anything other than hyper intense but what it left me with was this thought readers are permitted to be breathless but stories arent
6093991 it is a bold historian who writes a history of the caucasus as events of the past week have made all too clear

6094024 gaborik wanted to know who hes going to play with
6094025 and its pretty obvious it will be koivu everything has to work out but theres no better player on our team for him to play with than koivu and theres no better player than sheppard to replace koivu in the role koivu played
6094026 im not going to respond to rumors or outrageous rumors about trades
6094027 you have people on your side who are fiction writers i wont deal with fiction writers
6094028 whats the sense when we dont even know if hes going to play yet hes a good player and it certainly doesnt hurt to look
6094029 until september 20th when training camp opens he hasnt quit anything
6094030 wouldnt it just be easier if they took those things out of the way
6094031 well lets see i went out there as the best in my country to do something 0000001 of the population could make their bodies do i tried my hardest i got a silver medal now shove off for trying to make it sound like a failure

6094034 regardless of law marriage has only one definition and any government that attempts to change it is my mortal enemy i will act to destroy that government and bring it down only when the marriage of heterosexuals has the support of the whole society can we have our best hope of raising each new generation to aspire to continue our civilization
6094035 my bitches are children of venus we never let men come between us the task here before us is to switch to clitoris the patriarchs penis
6094036 i am just trying to stay on track i am hoping to come out and be a great player and leader and help us get to a higher level
6094037 you need to be able to turn to your tight end in this offense and get him the ball in tight space
6094038 rob is obviously a big physical tight end that we need to get in those situations and be accurate with the football thats where were going to score points in the red zone with a guy like that
6094039 were counting on him to be a leader on our football team
6094040 he always has been excellent in that area but hes coming off the injury and he made two big catches and he ran after the catch and scored with the ball on the second one it was very good for us to see
6094041 i am just trying to go out and get everybody going
6094042 we have a young team but we have more veterans than weve had in the past i just have to try and keep pushing the younger guys on offense
6094043 i always tell bills defensive coordinator perry fewell that i could play defense get him some sacks and touchdowns

6094050 to be the only view that is truly faithful to scripture and that fits the scientific evidence far better than the reigning old earth evolutionary theory
6094051 belief in millions of years undermines the bibles teaching on death and on the character of god
6094052 it kind of feels like were being told how to worship
6094053 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
6094054 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
6094055 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
6094056 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
6094057 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
6094058 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
6094059 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
6094060 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks
6094061 a cable representative will complete your installation between the hours of 1 00 pm and 4 00 pm
6094062 im not in a position to confirm or deny that
6094063 obviously its a personal matter and brett is working through that
6094064 the selectors are comfortable this move will maintain the competitive edge for the australian side and provide a wonderful opportunity for brett geeves to join the australian group for the first time
6094065 we look forward to brett lee rejoining the group as soon as possible
6094066 we know we cant drill our way to energy independence
6094067 far more than simply expanding our economic and political resources to keep oil flowing steadily
6094068 weve got to produce our own oil and gas here in our country
6094069 peace in the region should be re established and guaranteed so that no idiotic ideas ever come to anyones head that is the main task for the russian federation at the present moment
6094070 the presence of military forces on the georgian territory was wrong i believe we have to realise the plan of the six principles as soon as possible so that russian troops can leave the territory of georgia
6094071 georgia and ukraine could be members of nato we have left the timing open and we have said they could be made members if they want this and that position remains
6094072 some of russias actions were not proportionate russian troops should withdraw from central areas in georgia
6094073 this decision clearly demonstrates everything we have said recently the deployment of new anti missile forces in europe has as its aim the russian federation the moment has been chosen well and therefore any fairy tales about deterring other states fairy tales that with the help of this system we will deter some sort of rogue states no longer work it is sad for europe and for everyone living on this densely populated continent but it is not dramatic we will continue to work on this and we are ready to continue discussions with all participants but it is clear this decision will not create any sort of calm
6094074 we would not like of course to see relations deteriorate in the long or short term we have always based our position on full fledged development of relations with the eu separate eu states the united states and other states we are living in a fragile world and it is obvious that any worsening of the international environment will only serve the interests of the most reactionary forces those who dont understand this are blind we dont want to cut relations with anyone but nevertheless ill tell you that we have fulfilled and will continue to fulfil our peacekeeping mandate if someone continues to attack our citizens our peacekeepers we will of course respond in just the same way we have responded there should be no doubt about this
6094075 i think in such a complicated and difficult conflict it is rare that all the blame is on one side in fact both sides are probably to blame that is very important to understand
6094076 no one is rejecting the principle of territorial integrity as one of the main principles of international law unfortunately after what has happened it is unlikely that the ossetians and the abkhazians will be able to live in one state together with the georgians
6094077 we are of course not against international peacekeepers but it is not our position which matters the problem is that ossetians and abkhazians themselves do not trust anyone but russian peacekeepers
6094078 i lost almost 90 of my spirit in a girl
6094079 private actors either nonprofit or commercial are better suited to deliver government information to citizens and can constantly create and reshape the tools individuals use to find and leverage public data

6094083 display drivers have stopped working but have been successfully restored
6094084 there is no question for us that we would wind up in the top two which in the end is what matters

6094086 for whatever candidate comes in second theres plenty of time to reverse that order
6094087 the only way it would be damaging to one of the candidates is if the margin is breathtakingly high but my guess is it wont be

6094107 it is disheartening to watch us airways top executives enrich themselves with performance based stock awards while flight attendants continue to work under a bankruptcy driven contract that slashed wages and eliminated pensions and benefits
6094108 while us airways has improved its on time performance the airline still ranks number one in customer complaints which makes it even harder to justify this performance bonus
6094109 while management has every right to award themselves performance based stock grants it is a slap in the face to the hard working flight attendants who are facing job losses and have not received a simple cost of living increase in almost six years it is also an affront to the passengers being nickel and dimed for such comforts as a glass of water when will corporate america understand the devastating effects of this erosion on public and employee moral and trust

6094123 voters enthusiastically support chris gregoires common sense effective leadership and are eager for her to serve another term even after a well organized heavily funded attack effort against her governor gregoire triumphed in washingtons primary because she knows how to get results
6094124 the primary results confirm that voters understand full well the difference between governor gregoire and her republican opponent republican dino rossi cut health care for kids slashed education funding and voted against vital transportation funding for transit bridges and ferries the choice in november is clear an accomplished leader who delivers results for all of washington or a george bush republican who sides with special interests over everyday citizens
6094125 governor gregoire is working hard for working families and they will turn out for her in november in even greater numbers

6094128 it was a known hideout for militants at least eight people were killed and some foreign militants are among them
6094129 we will see after 72 hours and try to resolve this issue as we are committed to the judges restoration
6094130 as far as our principled stand is concerned we are not going to compromise
6094131 i was training as hard as i could and while my diet was healthy i figured that nutrition might be the key
6094132 so i went to a sports nutrition seminar afterwards i collared the speaker kerry kayes and we chatted about my injuries he went through my diet and said i wasnt getting enough protein it made sense so i started taking protein supplements that was the turning point
6094133 the trauma that modern triathletes put their bodies through is immense
6094134 that calls for extra protein to help muscles repair themselves to get enough extra protein from an ordinary diet would mean eating huge amounts of food and having to deal with subsequent weight issues a good protein supplement delivers the protein in a low calorie easily digested formula that gives the body what it needs when it needs it
6094135 i tend to go back to certain races each year to gauge my level of fitness
6094136 at wetherby in 2007 i came sixth with an overall time of two hours eight minutes this year in much worse conditions i came third in two hours three minutes
6094137 typically in the past id take around 25 minutes for a 1500 metre swim ive shaved at least two minutes off that this year
6094138 its the best job i could be doing i get to train every day while other people are at work and i can keep a close eye on my diet too
6094139 i live nine miles from the fire station so i run or bike in every day
6094140 theres no doubt that kerrys protein supplements have made all the difference this year
6094141 my performance has improved and im really enjoying competing theyre very easy to drink too absolutely spot on
6094142 frankies amazed me with his speed and power and hes got tremendous self discipline but although he watches his diet carefully and doesnt let himself go hes getting to be quite a big lad and if hes going to stay in the lightweight division as we think he should he needs to come down a few pounds
6094143 what is difficult is losing the weight to get down to the 60kg limit for the olympics while still training hard and building strength
6094144 the weight is coming off while his strength is increasing at the same time thats something thats normally very hard to achieve
6094145 ive got sixteen boys training hard here including several potential champions and theres up to 50 coming in regularly more than ever we are teaching them the importance of proper nutrition as part of their training
6094146 its my belief that a boxer needs to increase his water consumption during training to maintain a healthy balance
6094147 the extra protein is especially important boxers put their muscles through incredible trauma protein is used by the body for muscle repair and growth supplements give boxers like barnes murray and moore the protein they need in a low calorie easy to consume format and mean they can achieve and maintain their target weight without compromising fitness and stamina getting the required levels of protein from ordinary food would be impossible without eating so much that the boxers weight would rocket
6094148 kerrys programme has made a massive difference i feel really good my strength and stamina are improving daily
6094149 although hes still an amateur hes training like a pro ive never known anyone like him a real all rounder hes so fit and has got the greatest agility ive seen in any boxer
6094150 for years boxers have cut down on food and water to stay at target weights thats completely the wrong attitude
6094151 as a boxers training gets more intense nearer the fight he needs more nutrients to help his body repair and recuperate from the positive stress of training but he still has to stay in weight to make the weigh in so he cant get all the nutrients from his food alone because then hed end up taking in too many kcalories cnp protein supplements ensure that he gets the high amount of nutrients he needs in a low kcalorie environment
6094152 joe is only the second man in history from manchester to get to the boxing finals of the olympics and the first from manchester to win a medal at the world boxing championships where he won bronze in chicago in 2007
6094153 not all great olympic fighters come from london even if they end up going there in 2012
6094154 protein is used by the body for muscle repair and growth so needs to be consumed daily
6094155 those recovering from muscle trauma after extensive training will find that upping their protein intake significantly improves stamina strength and aids body repair this is vital to jamie his muscles need the extra quality protein to repair and recover
6094156 i feel really good my strength and stamina are improving daily kerrys great he makes all this pre fight training a lot easier
6094157 usually i feel really fatigued at this stage in my pre fight training
6094158 but this time i feel normal and am enjoying the training the protein shakes are very tasty easy to take and give me a real boost
6094159 lots of my family still live in co kilkenny and the fight is on irish tv so theyll all be watching
6094160 this makes it all the more important to do well and to be as fit as possible for the fight i want to do my family proud
6094161 my body knew it had been pushed but i really enjoyed the show
6094162 the level of interest has been huge despite the bad weather we had hundreds of spectators at the fitness factory
6094163 many of the uks top strength athletes are involved several have pulled out of alternative events to focus on the cnp league its created a huge buzz the strongman community has been talking about this exciting new format
6094164 all at 2 bold productions are delighted with the how the first show went and are excited about how the league will take shape this year
6094165 sports nutrition is still much misunderstood even by the top athletes and trainers
6094166 sponsoring events like this helps us push the nutrition message give your body the right fuel and itll perform better and for longer
6094167 the pro slam formula also includes beta alanine a carnosine synthesizer that delays muscle fatigue itll help the athletes put on a top quality show and help them recover for the next one
6094168 developing cost effective means of producing cellulosic biofuels on a national scale poses major scientific challenges these grants will help in developing the type of transformational breakthroughs needed in basic science to make this happen
6094169 usda is committed to fostering a sustainable domestic biofuels industry at home in rural america
6094170 these grants will broaden the sources of energy from many crops as well as improve the efficiency and options among renewable fuels
6094171 certain wild species of sunflower produce woody stems and high biomass yields often reaching heights of 18 to 21 feet
6094172 our grant focuses on understanding genetic mechanisms underlying wood production and biomass accumulation in sunflower
6094173 ethanol from switchgrass is a very different story from ethanol from maize grain
6094174 ethanol from maize grain requires large inputs and produces no net carbon capture to reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere switchgrass captures carbon dioxide very effectively and will not lead to increased food costs because it does not take acreage away from food production
6094175 once the foxtail millet genome is sequenced we will be able to quickly find the genes involved in making lignocellulose in foxtail millet and this will make them easy to find in switchgrass as well
6094176 we can then study these genes and find ways to improve this performance so that switchgrass is easier to convert to ethanol
6094177 in fact to quote usdas chief economist joe glauber the outlook for agriculture has rarely if ever been more favorable
6094178 and as usdas chief scientist i can tell you im equally positive about the future outlook for agriculture in general and also for peanuts
6094179 the reason im so positive is because of several factors peanuts are a highly nutritional commodity it is also a popular snack food but even more important is the fact peanuts can play a leading role in meeting the worlds growing demand for energy security
6094180 of course there are always disease and pests along with food safety issues and concerns associated with peanut allergens
6094181 as you all have heard the price of both fuel and food gets mentioned quite often in the press
6094182 the good news is that agriculture is getting a lot more attention the bad news is that biofuels production is getting too much of the blame for rising food prices of course much of the blame is on corn based ethanol
6094183 the fact is there are many other factors at play including the rising cost of inputs including diesel pesticides fertilizer and droughts around the world higher food prices are also affected by population growth depreciation of the dollar and rising expectations increases in standard of living of many people around the world
6094184 i consider sustainable bioenergy production to be one of the grand challenges for agriculture of this century other grand challenges include climate change water availability and food security not surprisingly all four of these grand challenges are connected and all four can benefit from more agricultural research education and extension
6094185 of course right now soybeans are the primary oilseed used in biodiesel production however soybeans contain only between 18 and 25 percent oil whereas peanuts are approximately 50 percent oil scientists estimate that 2 800 pounds of peanuts per acre could yield in excess of 110 gallons of biodiesel per acre a 50 percent increase per acre versus soybeans
6094186 were very excited about the future for peanuts as a source of biofuels
6094187 one of the main ways we stay ahead of pest and disease issues is by developing new pest and disease resistant varieties scientists need to first find the right genes however narrow genetic diversity in commercial peanuts has hampered progress in developing improved varieties the long term competitiveness of the peanut industry in the united states depends on breeders being able to use new genomic and molecular technologies to find important genes to use in peanut breeding and variety development programs
6094188 another exciting development is a new variety called tifguard developed by the ars crop genetics and breeding research unit at tifton ga
6094189 its the first variety that has resistance to both root knot nematode and tomato spotted wilt virus on farm testing has been very favorable
6094190 i know one of your important issues is improving the grading system
6094191 this is an area where research can help improve the efficiency of peanut grading by developing new procedures or technologies ars has been working with the agricultural marketing service and industry to do just that
6094192 research by usda ars and university of georgia scientists is under way to develop management systems that will aid growers minimizing the impact of these weeds researchers are screening various herbicides and looking at different cover crops which may provide more effective controls weed management will likely include unique combinations of herbicides and cultural practices
6094193 for these reasons usda has a broad based research program to develop sustainable agricultural systems that conserve natural resources while improving efficiency one of the most interesting projects in recent years has been experiments conducted at the national peanut research laboratory in dawson during 2006 2007 researchers there have shown you can achieve increased yield water savings and economic returns in peanuts corn and cotton by using furrow dikes

6094211 at the core of all of this is what it means to be a public broadcaster
6094212 and that is to provide programming for all canadians and to reflect the arts and culture scene in canada and to reflect canada back to canadians
6094213 so cbc is greatly compressing that kind of music which you could call serious music into a listening ghetto of 10 a m to 3 p m

6094233 there are several methods available today that offer scientists the important ability to get proteins dna and rna from the same sample however unlike nearly all of these kits proteosolve sb does not use inefficient columns or harsh detergents that can cause serious problems with protein recovery instead proteosolve sb uses organic solvents that can be easily and quickly removed and that have been shown to offer enhanced protein recovery over current methods furthermore unlike proteosolve sb none of the methods available today extract lipids in addition to proteins and nucleic acids from the same biological sample lipid extraction is very important and integral to a systems biology approach
6094234 our number one priority is to drive the installed base of pct sample preparation systems throughout the life sciences area we believe the best way to achieve this goal is to develop pct dependent products that can improve scientific research and enhance the opportunity for discovery proteosolve sb and the recently released ft500 nd pulse tube and the proteolysis trypsin prep application were all designed with these important objectives in mind to this end we believe that our pct dependent products have already begun to fill unmet needs in critical growing areas of scientific research this in part accounts for the record number of installations already achieved in the current quarter and the expectation that we will install 40 or more pct systems in 2008 as compared to 20 in 2007 as announced on august 14th

6094301 i asked him today if he was mayan and i think i offended him
6094302 well maybe it would have been more diplomatic to just ask him where he was from
6094303 yeah i did and he said an area that didnt mean anything to me at all so i asked if he was mayan i still think he is or at least hes of mayan descent i mean he doesnt have any body hair at all and mayans dont they never have to shave or anything
6094304 we are pleased to report another exceptional quarter for instacare as our businesses grew and remained profitable on a continued surge in sales we have successfully implemented our medical diagnostics and medical disposable products distribution plans and these businesses have generated almost six million dollars in sales during the first half of fiscal 2008 quite an accomplishment even in a slowing national economy we are currently maintaining momentum in what is usually our slowest quarter perhaps signifying further developments later this year

6094327 some of our elected leaders have forgotten that they were elected by south floridians and not the special interest groups lining their coffers

6094330 there are several methods available today that offer scientists the important ability to get proteins dna and rna from the same sample however unlike nearly all of these kits proteosolve sb does not use inefficient columns or harsh detergents that can cause serious problems with protein recovery instead proteosolve sb uses organic solvents that can be easily and quickly removed and that have been shown to offer enhanced protein recovery over current methods furthermore unlike proteosolve sb none of the methods available today extract lipids in addition to proteins and nucleic acids from the same biological sample lipid extraction is very important and integral to a systems biology approach
6094331 our number one priority is to drive the installed base of pct sample preparation systems throughout the life sciences area we believe the best way to achieve this goal is to develop pct dependent products that can improve scientific research and enhance the opportunity for discovery proteosolve sb and the recently released ft500 nd pulse tube and the proteolysis trypsin prep application were all designed with these important objectives in mind to this end we believe that our pct dependent products have already begun to fill unmet needs in critical growing areas of scientific research this in part accounts for the record number of installations already achieved in the current quarter and the expectation that we will install 40 or more pct systems in 2008 as compared to 20 in 2007 as announced on august 14th
6094332 the first half of 2008 has been a milestone building period for thermoenergy and our subsidiaries we have continued to make strides in our contract negotiations with new york city and believe we are within 60 90 days of announcing the finalization of the contract for the 26th ward arp project additionally we continue to move closer to a finalized agreement structure with babcock power inc relating to our tips process finally castion continues to excel at winning new business opportunities and should move towards break even on an annualized basis in the second half of 2008 as our backlog continues to grow to more than 8 million of which we expect to close 1 3 million by year end 2008

6094338 as such low levels of ionising radiation is one of the smallest risks in the environment and causes a tiny amount of the spontaneous damage to dna in our bodies
6094339 it has led to unacceptable societal penalties as clearly demonstrated in the aftermath of the chernobyl catastrophe

6094343 before i left for beijing i went to chicos and picked out my entire wardrobe for the trip i knew i was going to need to be prepared for a variety of events activities and climates so i picked key pieces that i could mix and match dress up and dress down thats what i love about chicos their clothes arent only well made but also great for travel they drape beautifully dont cling and flatter all body types im a jewelry person so i love that you can change the accessories and have an entirely new look its fun i love chicos
6094344 as an educator single mother and her sons biggest champion debbie has been an inspiration to us and to our customers all over the world ever since debbie first wore chicos in beijing our phone lines have been ringing off the hook women everywhere want to know how to get debbies look
6094345 i dont really worry about it ive got a lot of confidence that cordero is going to do what it takes to get out of it
6094346 ik voelde dat het mijn dag zou zijn ik wilde voor de winst gaan en wist ook dat ik dat zou kunnen omdat er al een paar toppers uitliggen ruik je een kans dan maak ik een fout op de horde vijf dat moet ik gaan corrigeren dat kost me een tiende en een finaleplaats
6094347 ik sliep pas tegen vijf uur in de ochtend toen ik opstond was ik helemaal brak ik liep gisteren dinsdag 13 43 seconden dat was nu voldoende geweest voor een finaleplaats ik wist echter al in de ochtend dat het voor mij voorbij was ik denk dat ik iets verkeerds heb gegeten echt balen
6094348 het was in onze poule veruit de sterkste ploeg waar we tegen hebben gespeeld die 1 0 overwinning kregen we allesbehalve cadeau
6094349 het wordt een heel leuke wedstrijd vier jaar geleden ging het tegen duitsland fout nu kan het bijna niet anders dan dat we het tot een goed einde brengen
6094350 in athene ging het al mis voor de wedstrijd daar zijn achteraf veel oorzaken voor te noemen wat dat geweest is daar heb ik nu geen zin in om over te praten het is allang uitgesproken en we hebben het ver achter ons gelaten er is voor mij nog maar n ding dat teldt en dat is de finale
6094351 ik denk dat die argentijnse meiden gewoon niet zo heel veel hadden daarnaast waren wij conditioneel veel en veel beter
6094352 op dat vlak hebben we ze weg gezet we hebben voortdurend iemand in de dekking op aymar gehad en wisten ook dat hun keepster heel erg zwak was bovendien hebben onze spitsen vandaag aangetoond in fantastische vorm te verkeren
6094353 wanneer je zo riant voor staat is het moeilijk om achterin geconcentreerd te blijven spelen want je weet dat dit een counterploeg is de 4 0 kwam als een bevrijding de 5 1 trouwens ook
6094354 dat is iets waar we voortdurend door mensen van buiten de ploeg mee geconfronteerd worden voor ons is athene een hoofdstuk dat we al lang geleden hebben afgesloten
6094355 ik heb altijd gezegd dat deze olympische spelen om basis van fysieke gesteldheid wordt beslist daar heb ik wel gelijk in gekregen
6094356 deze speelsters zijn de laatste maanden meer dan eens helemaal kapot gegaan in de trainingen maar ik heb nooit ofte nimmer iemand horen klagen het resultaat van die arbeid zie je in deze halve finale tegen argentini op het veld terug
6094357 dat is een ander aspect waar we in de voorbereiding veel aandacht aan hebben besteed we hebben geleerd geen angst te hebben voor de spanning of ons te focussen op het resultaat onze grootste focus ligt bij het spel
6094358 my friends at gap have created this really simple shirt that lets you express whats important to you
6094359 music is how i express myself so i wrote vote for love on my shirt im really interested to see all of the words and visual expressions the people of chicago use to voice what theyre passionate about
6094360 the lhc is a discovery machine we dont know what well find
6094361 im actually hoping we find something unexpected that does the job of the higgs
6094362 weve been debating this for 30 years and one way or another the lhc will definitively tell us how electroweak symmetry breaking occurs thats a fundamental advance
6094363 its a tough game you can only do it by statistical analysis since there are other known processes that produce events that can mimic a higgs boson signal
6094364 by itself the higgs is a very puzzling particle so there have been a lot of conjectures about some kind of new physics beyond the standard model supersymmetry has the easiest time fitting in with what we know
6094365 initially well be looking for things that are known standards to make sure that everything is working properly in 2009 we could start really looking for new things like supersymmetry
6094366 these large projects take such a long time we have to start early
6094367 weve been operating it and looking at cosmic ray particles
6094368 nature gives us these cosmic rays for free and theyre the same kinds of particles well see when the machine turns on so it enables us to check out certain aspects of the detector but were very excited to start seeing collisions from the machine
6094369 well be throwing away a lot of data so we have to make sure the triggers are working correctly
6094370 the graduate students and postdocs get to go to geneva but even the undergraduates get a chance to work in a real physics lab and be part of a major international experiment
6094371 there is a high level of interaction and camaraderie between theorists and experimentalists at ucsc which is not the case at other leading institutions
6094372 for me its valuable just in terms of being aware of whats happening on the experimental side
6094373 you got better things to do guys im not the guy

6094377 anyone who says that economic security is a human right has been too much babied while he babbles other men are risking and losing their lives to protect him they are fighting the sea fighting the land fighting diseases and insects and weather and space and time for him while he chatters that all men have a right to security and that some pagan god society the state the government the commune must give it to them let the fighting men stop fighting this inhuman earth for one hour and he will learn how much security there is

6094382 these 10 finalists are the future science leaders in america and discovery is so proud to be associated with so much passion dedication and intellect that will ultimately keep the united states competitive in these critical fields
6094383 science is at the very heart of 3m driving the pulse of innovation throughout our company on a global basis we have a responsibility to foster interest and development in the innovators of our future and our partnership with discovery provides the ideal platform for students and teachers to demonstrate just how exciting the journey of learning can be
6094384 americas best days might be ahead of us long term but because of the damage done by the bush administration the next few years are going to hurt
6094385 the mccain team has constructed a persona that can attack at will but can never be attacked they have used mccains pow history to create a firewall to shield him from all criticism and as a universal qualifier for all things that pertain to foreign policy or to the military

6094387 our members are taking this action very reluctantly they care deeply about the vital services they provide and those who depend on them and we apologise for any disruption
6094388 however members feel they have no choice when the employers offer is effectively a pay cut
6094389 the issues are difficult and complex and need to be carefully thought through
6094390 however as soon as possible we will arrange talks with the trade unions in a bid to reach a settlement which takes account of the soaring cost of living which affects councils just as much as our workers

6094394 the latest big no was when i brought knight rider back to nbc
6094395 they said we love the project but we dont think we want you starring in it
6094396 several details remain to be sorted out to make the loan official
6094397 for me she was bordering on extreme confidence and that was a worry when the rest of us were wetting ourselves
6094398 im going to be there whether you like it or not
6094399 when you go to the olympics you catch the bug i used to walk to stratford station every morning on my way to uni and its 15 minutes from my house i hope i can treat is as not just a random meet
6094400 im fortunate in that my last 100 metres is always the strongest part of my race but one day someone is going to catch me up so i need to make sure every other bit is as good
6094401 she wasnt able to race for the first half of the season and still went out there to train every day not knowing whether she was going to be able to run not knowing exactly what she was training for that was impressive
6094402 i was worried because when you go into a final you want to believe youre in your best shape
6094403 but i had a headache and it was hot and it was the final and everything was getting to me
6094404 then if id seen how fast sanya went off then id have panicked and that would have messed up my head but i like working under pressure thats what i get my kicks out of i like being told i cant do something and then going out and doing it
6094405 in the 400 metres its the last 15 metres that are crucial thats where you win and lose races but i was glad i was in my own bubble
6094406 you train for nine months to race for three months and out of those three months you have three days to put your mark down
6094407 you might get a world record but if you cant go to a championship and perform when youve spent nine months killing yourself whats the point
6094408 she didnt attack the third 100 metres and thats what she will have to do to run 48 seconds which she can do
6094409 we are totally committed to giving our customers the lowest prices in britain every day of the year
6094410 we are giving customers the uks cheapest mobile call plan thats simple to understand and a tariff with no hidden extras
6094411 people are scared about whether theyll have a job later this year and if they do manage to keep their job theyre nervous about whether theyll be able to cope with the added workload thats clearly on the horizon
6094412 the company intends to roll out a new editorial system whilst shedding a large number of staff its inevitable that those who remain will be expected to carry a greater burden of work and that has implications for the lives of everyone working on the papers not to mention the long term future of quality journalism at the titles
6094413 rumours have been flying around for ages so the announcement was not a surprise
6094414 but it was a bit of a shock when they made all these announcements they raised more questions than they answered
6094415 there will be a number of people who will take redundancy the changes are quite big and there will be some people who feel that all the retraining is going to be so big its not something they are going to want to go through
6094416 feelings are mixed some people are understanding but unhappy while others are just plain furious
6094417 both crew ejected safely and are currently being assessed medically
6094418 the civilian air ambulance is at the scene along with a raf search and rescue helicopter
6094419 we do not know what caused this incident however a board of inquiry is being established to investigate all aspects of the crash
6094420 both crew ejected safely and are currently being assessed medically
6094421 the civilian air ambulance is at the scene along with a raf search and rescue helicopter
6094422 we do not know what caused this incident however a board of inquiry is being established to investigate all aspects of the crash
6094423 it has been several days since the agreement was signed and we dont see any signs of significant russian withdrawal
6094424 two things are necessary one is the pullback of georgian forces to their barracks we have not seen that happen yet and secondly we need to be assured that our peacekeepers are not going to be attacked again
6094425 trying to make a victim out of an aggressor and whitewash a criminal regime save a collapsing regime and is taking the path to the rearmament of the current leaders in georgia
6094426 this is the key factor provoking attempts for yet another blitzkrieg
6094427 is the absolute minimum that could be expected in reaction to russias cynical disregard of georgian sovereignty moscow cannot have been overawed it confirms the impression of putin and co that nato is a paper tiger at the moment at odds with itself and unassertive
6094428 natos insistence that it still intends to welcome georgia and ukraine into the alliance remains little more than lip service as long as neither is offered a concrete timeline within the framework of a membership action plan this waffling will encourage moscow to make life for wannabe nato members difficult
6094429 it is still possible to return to a constructive relationship with russia
6094430 the result of the nato summit rather thin for a meeting on the foreign minister level shows one thing above all else nato is only now beginning to once again think about russia new members like poland or the baltic states may have been pointing out for a long time that russia is once again following its old imperialist reflexes but in the west few have taken such warnings seriously the issue of russia seemed to have been set aside following the collapse of the soviet union
6094431 nato must now figure out where the red line is when it comes to moscow and how it can prevent that line from being crossed the alliance must also make a fundamental decision is the west prepared to accept a world that is once again divided into zones of influence dominated by the big and powerful or does one want to try and defend the new order which developed while russia was weak one which gave smaller countries space to decide on their own futures
6094432 the realization has come slowly but surely the political partnership with russia was an illusion in reality the country under the double leadership of prime minister vladimir putin and president dmitry medvedev is a difficult comrade day after day moscow refuses to withdraw its troops from georgia as promised the russian military isnt just destroying georgias infrastructure but is also destroying russias image in the rest of the world
6094433 in the beginning the kremlin spin doctors managed to push through their interpretation that georgia was the aggressor and that russia was merely protecting its own citizens but in the meantime it has become apparent that putin had planned this war long before prepared for it and lured georgia into a trap south ossetia and abkhazia have already been swallowed up and tbilisi has been humiliated now moscow is destroying georgias economy with little regard for the eu peace plan and the warnings from the west
6094434 europeans and americans are watching seemingly powerlessly but they are not without tools of their own the suspension of the nato russia council is the first step to be followed by a close look at russias wto entry and its membership in the g 8 putin and his comrades feel strong but russia will be paying for this war for a long time to come
6094435 after our last talk with him he agreed to go to another country in asia
6094436 migration in east asia cases studies from japan china and taiwan
6094437 the ghost is not a weapon its a way of life
6094438 america may be a ticking time bomb but we are threatened more by enemies within than external terrorists by ideological fanatics on the left and the right
6094439 now the second thing you have to do is shove them up your a without changing the expression on your face
6094440 all i got was a headache she kept slapping my forehead and pulling my ears
6094441 let us go somewhere else to the nearby villages so i can preach there also that is why i have come
6094442 i expect its going to be chaotic in here today
6094443 i woke up and was surprised the storm wasnt as bad as i thought it would be
6094444 its very seldom were hoping for a hurricane but we are
6094445 i know people hate drought but when youre talking about a tropical cyclone relieving drought conditions be careful what you wish for
6094446 our biggest concern is complacency jacksonville has a history of being shielded from storm systems while we dont want anyone to panic we want everyone in the area to take this storm seriously
6094447 i just came in from the fields everything is burning up
6094448 if a storm is brewing down there just send it up i 26
6094449 este aparato va a modificar la calidad de vida de las personas ciegas
6094450 con esta invenci n yo intent cubrir una necesidad propia
6094451 adem s siempre me molest ver el padecimiento que tienen las personas ciegas porque creo que es una de las peores discapacidades que hay
6094452 la idea del concurso es que los vecinos puedan proponer soluciones creativas para los problemas y deficiencias de la ciudad
6094453 yo tengo dos objetivos a cubrir que el invento le sirva a la gente y que genere fuentes de trabajo ya que a partir de esto quiz se podr a desarrollar un negocio
6094454 these children have a very serious infection that is causing tissue necrosis the death of the tissue
6094455 its not like it is in older children and adults where its generally an invasive group a strep but indeed it is a necrotizing tissue destroying infection that theyve got
6094456 the review has not in any way turned up anything that would cause concern for mothers to be and the lethbridge region
6094457 if we had any concerns that there was something related to the hospital its dr mustos responsibility to shut the hospital down
6094458 in this particular incidence weve not been able to uncover the source of the infection
6094459 because its such an unusual event that there is two of these children that have such a significant infection we thought it wise to ask for another review of this and this is normal practice
6094460 because of the privacy act we need a formally signed consent form from the parents to release any information about the condition of the children
6094461 we dont have that and i dont think were going to be getting it
6094462 to a large extent universities and colleges have been slow to adopt the online tools and approaches which are taking educational technology by storm
6094463 its not necessarily the students who want us to use the tools
6094464 the more teachers that use the tool the more useful it becomes
6094465 using technology as a backup to things going on the class
6094466 a lot of production reduction has happened and a lot of stock has been driven down i think that we should be in quite another position at the start of next year
6094467 i wouldnt go so far as to say we will be making good money next year we still have some longer term adjustments to go through

6094543 it is for the unions and local authorities to resolve this dispute and avoid further disruption to public services

6094545 it is time that scotlands employers took note of the strength of feeling amongst their staff and reopened their final offer for negotiation
6094546 the level of solidarity that i have seen going round the picket lines indicates that our members and their colleagues from the other unions are determined to win a better deal
6094547 council staff in scotland have delivered nearly 200 million worth of efficiency savings that councils should share with staff as well as with council tax payers
6094548 obviously we are disappointed at the disruption to services caused by strike action today

6094563 nothing is completely recession proof but movies are one of the ultimate social experiences
6094564 despite the fact that more americans now have high tech entertainment equipment in our homes nothing beats seeing dark knight in a theater
6094565 although an uncertain economy plays a role in ticket buying habits consumers will also find other ways to entertain themselves if there arent compelling movies to see and thats the case whether the economy is weak or flourishing
6094566 over time increases in the cost of movie tickets may move the social experience into the home

6094574 this book is about taking chances there is a point where firebelly makes a literal leap of faith one that anyone who has ever taken a chance can relate to belief requires doubt and translating that belief into action requires courage

6094696 thats the beauty i think of writing vague but powerful lyrics that someone like a movie director can interpret it in his own way and obviously someone creative is able to take the metaphors and apply them to whatever he needs in his own life
6094697 the main theme of the video is the human element of forgiveness and someone doing you wrong you feeling resentment and you being able to see through that in the next situation that might be similar and not take your rage or resentment out on the next person and basically keep spreading the disease of that through life
6094698 the one thing that i wasnt keen on here was metallica plugging into a modern war or a current event that might be construed as some sort of political statement on our part
6094699 metallica has never plugged into any current event visually but this one is kind of a hotbed people have very high opinions about this war and were trying to cut through all of that the politics and the religion tend to separate people and what were trying to do is bring it together with the common thread of resentment and forgiveness
6094700 the basics you will need either access to a digital camera or a way to upload pictures of your kids drawings etc unless you choose to do them on a computer you or your students will need to have access to one computer to type in all of the completed information about the candidate for others to read

6094703 this isnt just a win for me personally and for other lesbian women
6094704 anyone could be the next target if doctors are allowed to pick and choose their patients based on religious views about other groups of people

6094714 when you put more police on the streets when you have specific initiatives designed to go after specific types of offences those are two of many circumstances that result in increased numbers
6094715 at one time you would never hear of a robbery a daylight robbery at a bank was unheard of
6094716 now nobody gets too excited about it knocking off a macs milk store thats more common today than it was years ago
6094717 people do move here to get away from the city because they feel when theyre in the city youve got more violence more crimes and more of a chance of getting hurt
6094718 times have changed and were trying to keep up with them
6094719 it challenges the myth that cities are violent and rural areas are not
6094720 in huron county they were totally outraged because the people were such fine upstanding citizens they didnt deserve a death like that
6094721 people feel like theyve really been intruded upon because its not the way of life up here
6094722 its really a country feeling we have people come here because they want out of the rat race and a slower pace
6094723 its almost like an arms war at one point in time a good old fashioned fist fight may have been the way differences were sorted out
6094724 the increase in violence goes hand in hand with the need to arm oneself to have the advantage if you want to have the upper hand you go with the biggest gun guns are in the hands of young people and thats because they are actively seeking them
6094725 all kinds of crime is going on but it only becomes officially crime when police charge someone
6094726 it does depend upon the focus of police with weapons charges it might relate to a concentrated focus of police activity
6094727 instead what were seeing is a steady trend line up
6094728 what weve done is moved the crime up along various highways out of the gta and weve moved it into some of these communities where theyve never heard of anybody being arrested with a gun now its routine its had a devastating impact
6094729 we need a guns and gangs initiative thats pan provincial that really understands that handgun and gang activity is as dangerous in small town and rural ontario as it is in toronto
6094730 i personally believe everyone in america should be trained in the use of handguns in public school and be given a gun
6094731 if someone hands 40 million a year to you over there
6094732 im saying its hard for a guy to turn that down
6094733 ill be honest with you its going to be interesting to see what happens in the next three or four years as european teams develop as you learn from playing in the nba business is business
6094734 you want to win personally and you want to win when you get your check every month its a competition and sometimes that means the highest bidder wins i think if a player chooses to go overseas instead of the nba or as weve seen with brandon jennings a high school player goes straight there i think its an awesome thing that you have options when you dont have options i think you feel trapped

6094757 it is appalling to me that people still want to invoke my fathers name five years after his death to ascribe beliefs ideals values and loyalties to him that cannot possibly be determined and to try to further their own agendas by doing so
6094758 this is especially dangerous in the case of political affiliation it is unfair and presumptuous to use him to bolster any platform

6094766 im glad to see that nbc has adopted that approach with the olympics because it validates the approach weve taken for years
6094767 espn is interested in bidding for the next round of olympic games 2014 and 2016 which will take place before october 09

6094805 commodization is an erosive competitive condition where it is very difficult for your customers to perceive any meaningful distinction between your products and services and those of your competitors
6094806 if your customers cant perceive any meaningful distinction between your products or services and everyone elses then theyll almost certainly buy the least expensive one
6094807 this leads to lowest cost being the sole basis for competition a strategy that only the most efficient companies can make work and usually only at razor thin margins
6094808 this is why we see commodization occurring across the board in virtually every industry today
6094809 its a sure sign of a systemic failure in companies with their products and services becoming commoditized

6094831 nansulate has been specified into the main cooling and heating system for this design nansulate added to the mattress cover system was found to reduce cooling temperature at a rate of 1 8 degrees per minute as compared to the foam insulation alone which reduced temperature at a rate of 1 1 degrees per minute all tests were performed under identical conditions cooling one gallon of fluid by speeding up the cooling process substantial energy savings were achieved in addition nansulate prevented sweating during the cooling process and also prevents growth of unwanted substances on the surface of the system
6094832 the same carefully researched cooling and heating system specifying nansulate will be incorporated into a new machine to form x ray invisible casts with perfectly even pressure over the entire area of a broken limb the casts can be worn while swimming or bathing and re formed again with perfectly even pressure when swelling reduces due to nansulate the time to form a perfectly even pressure cast will be approximately three minutes additionally nansulate is being specified in the heating and cooling system for a unique portable machine to heat and or cool with adjustable massage any area of the body for sports medicine and general physiotherapy needs this machine will free up the doctor or technician to perform other tasks the portability of the battery operated machine is due in large part to the energy savings realized with nansulate insulating coatings
6094833 the incorporation of our nansulate coating into these medical devices represents a brand new market segment opportunity edward moore design is an expert in their field and we look forward to our technology offering unique benefits to their company for this medical equipment and other designs energy savings is something that is important to every industry and we are pleased to offer a solution that can be used in a variety of diverse applications

6094909 my decision after looking at all the treatment plans that were possibilities for me the only one that seemed the most logical and the one that was going to work for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy
6094910 i didnt want to go back to the doctors every four months for testing and squishing and everything i just wanted to kind of be rid of this whole thing for me this was the choice that i made and it was a tough one
6094911 oh my god i was so pissed off so mad i was just shaking
6094912 immediately i had to go into take care of business mode
6094913 i watched her have a mastectomy and then i watched her go through two years of chemotherapy and eight surgeries and a hysterectomy
6094914 ive watched this woman survive both of those things so for me there was always that sense that i was going to be okay no matter what
6094915 besides me being really vigilant about it mammograms and self examinations it is the no 1 reason i am going to live

6094953 really source of proof please science observation proves you wrong and a habitual chronic pathological liar as well
6094954 on june 12 1980 a third explosive eruption produced 25 feet of stratification that amazed geologists successive layers are traditionally thought to require long periods of time to form yet upwards of 100 layers accumulated mostly between the nighttime hours of 9 and 12 while a plume swiftly ascended nine miles above the mountain wave after wave of pyroclastic flows began hurtling out of the crater and down the north slope each dusting the valley below with another lamination measuring from a fraction of an inch to over a yard in thickness each took from a few seconds to a few minutes to form
6094955 geologist steven austin described these pyroclastic flows as ground hugging fluidized turbulent slurries of fine volcanic debris they moved down the mountainside at hurricane speeds and left deposits of 1000 degrees f one would expect each deposit to be homogenized amp thoroughly mixed remarkably these high velocity slurries of red hot ash and pumice separated into coarse and fine particles of perfectly defined layers such features follow laws governing flows demonstrated in laboratory sedimentation tanks
6094956 similar thin layering appears in the tapeats sandstones of the grand canyon
6094957 yup you could explain to me that you have observed first hand the layering in your septic tank too im sure there is an analogy here but it escapes me at the moment do tell what is the connection
6094958 i suppose you did read darwins radio your choice of reading materials reveals a lot dawkins specialties are fiction and fantasy not observable science his much acclaimed among fools weasel analogy was a complete fraud youre clutching at fables in a last ditch effort to avoid the conclusion that there is a god to whom you will answer one day youre not ready for that
6094959 hey bj antibiotics kill bacteria not viruses you cant kill viruses with antibiotics and viruses dont mutate in response to antibiotics theyre unaffected sheesh i would have thought you would get it the first time you were corrected your knowledge of science is pathetic and youre a very dense slow learner
6094960 so we have layer upon layer fair enough of varying thicknesses of pyroclastic flows why is that such a big deal and yet again i gave to remind you that such layers are not sedimentary
6094961 yah and bears make big potty in the woods so what are you still beating that one trick pony i regret to inform you but your hobbyhorse is dead
6094962 are you a complete freaking idjit the point is that the aggregates were not only layered but segregated according to aggregate size what you have at msh is 25 feet of finely layered segregated aggregates laid down in 3 hours not a long series of separate volcanic eruptions one ringy dingy two ringy dingy if you cant comprehend the material go back to the nursery and retrieve your binky
6094963 for anyone who just tuned in see 7 wonders of mount st helens
6094964 compare the fish pig and human embryos which animals are probably more closely related and why
6094965 they maybe layered but they formed as a result of volcanic activity so they are not sedimentary rocks sorry for shouting but hopefully it may sink in eventually
6094966 the reason it hasnt been discovered before is no right thinking paleontologist would do what mary did with her specimens we dont go to all this effort to dig this stuff out of the ground to then destroy it in acid
6094967 how many artifacts are needed to prove that man and dinosaur co existed it would seem to present a major difficulty for evolutionists to explain the representation in art or literature or in artifacts of recognizable species of dinosaurs by ancient men who supposely had never seen one alive one could surmise that perhaps they had merely come across fossils but surely they would not have had the necessary skills to assemble them and then to draw them or describe them as in life modern scientists have themselves occasionally placed the wrong heads on skeletons or combined the bones of more than one specimen this presents a problem if you believe in uniformism and evolution
6094968 actually crime is on the rise especially rape and murder it may still be low but for countries with small populations its a drastic increase on top of that scandinavia in particular norway has cultivated and spawned some powerful anti religious movements the black metal movement that grew to infamy in the 1990s hit the national newspapers with almost one hundred church burnings and espoused a venomously anti christian doctrine its adherents worshipped odin the norse gods and satan they wanted not only the continued decline of christianity but a revival of nordic paganism in addition scandinavia has a healthy population of laveyan satanists so there still religious the just don t follow the bible paganism has always been in scandinavian countries and its been on a sharp rise in the last 20 years santa clause is worshipped every year all over the world santa came from the scandinavian religions of old so there quite religious just not christian
6094969 why would i do that the bible goes all the way back to creation its not given by an angel of light
6094970 compare the fish pig and human embryos which animals are probably more closely related and why
6094971 your density amazes me both gas charged slurries which formed the msh strata and water charged slurries which formed the tapeats strata follow the same laws of physics i e they follow laws governing flows of fluidized turbulent slurries of debris demonstrated in laboratory sedimentation tanks the volcano has demonstrated that such formations can be formed rapidly a global flood would have produced tapeats in a brief time
6094972 the difference is that this demonstration of the behavior of fluidized turbulent slurries of debris at msh was a gas charged slurry while the flood was primarily a demonstration of the behavior and end results of water charged slurries on a much more massive scale the flood also involved the laying down of volcanic debris but the whole demonstration was inundated with water for a year so what happens when volcanic debris is thoroughly mixed with other types of aggregates and subjected to the conditions that have already been demonstrated in laboratory sedimentation tanks hm m m m would you not get the rapid formation of a great number of segregated layers of sedimentary rock in a very short period of time good grief man the ancient romans used volcanic sand and ash to make concrete doesnt that tell you anything
6094973 you also said they were living matter which they are not now that is an interesting hypothesis viruses which are not alive mutate therefore proving evolution in living things somebody help me with this i swear that somewhere i read that the flatworm was evolving faster than the human my thought then why are they still flatworms
6094974 red bloods cells in a 65 million year old fossil
6094975 how many artifacts are needed to prove that man and dinosaur co existed it would seem to present a major difficulty for evolutionists to explain the representation in art or literature or in artifacts of recognizable species of dinosaurs by ancient men who supposely had never seen one alive
6094976 one could surmise that perhaps they had merely come across fossils but surely they would not have had the necessary skills to assemble them and then to draw them or describe them as in life
6094977 modern scientists have themselves occasionally placed the wrong heads on skeletons or combined the bones of more than one specimen
6094978 the reason it hasnt been discovered before is no right thinking paleontologist would do what mary did with her specimens we dont go to all this effort to dig this stuff out of the ground to then destroy it in acid
6094979 no the simple answer is that the drawings are based upon fear of the afterlife and legend
6094980 i would expect that from someone who is simple minded
6094981 a lot of the procedural issues necessary for instant replay to be implemented need to be worked out
6094982 im not going to go through these one by one i will tell you that on a number of them the comments are simply not accurate
6094983 there are other issues that remain to be worked out it is my general policy that i dont comment when im trying to bargain but i remain confident that were gong to be able to make a deal
6094984 thus there will be a lack of transparency and obviousness for the public as to what is going on when instant replay is under way

6095076 risk of suicide in older adults is higher among patients with cancer than among patients with other medical illnesses even after psychiatric illness and the risk of dying within a year were accounted for
6095077 a substantial number of cancer outpatients report thoughts that they would be better off dead or had thoughts of hurting themselves
6095078 what is interesting and potentially important about the studies is that these thoughts about suicide and the associated risk factors that are relatively well known for terminally ill patients may be just as important for those patients with cancer who are survivors or are living with the disease

6095231 the government has taken tremendous liberties with our liberty taking away our liberty in the name of fighting terrorism using fear to take away peoples rights and their privacy in this country
6095232 and thats caused me and a lot of americans to lose a great deal of faith in the government which ought to be protecting our liberties not taking them away

6095243 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative
6095244 which is as textbook a case of the pot calling the kettle black as has ever been recorded
6095245 gore is the person who in the congress most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an internet
6095246 has played a powerful role in policy terms that has supported its continued growth and application for which we should be thankful
6095247 i have personal experience of debt and have come through it i know that when i was struggling with debt the idea of a website where i could talk confidentially about my worries get advice support and compassion would have been very important to me
6095248 almost half a million people become funts financial untouchables every year and the number is growing i see that there is a grave need for help advice and support for financial worries because this situation can really happen to any one of us
6095249 we are supporting this campaign because we believe there are many thousands of people in britain who are doing their absolute best to repay as much of their debt as they can afford yet who are treated as funts by financial institutions making life much more difficult to live
6095250 debt is such an overwhelming worry that it actually impacts on our physical health if you have debt and many of us have please get advice face it come to the best arrangement you can with your creditors and use tools such as reallyworriedaboutdebt com

6095258 we wanted to provide something exciting and different from the typical night out
6095259 people dont typically put live music and art together often and when they do its not usually in the right context
6095260 i decided to take a break from music for a bit and focus on my art
6095261 i prefer art in general and think im much more talented in that field than i am musically
6095262 i started this project a couple of years ago when i was inspired to paint on silkscreens i liked the transparent effect they gave to the pieces
6095263 i enjoy it more and find it more rewarding both on emotional and monetary levels i have sold several paintings over the years so i would probably aim to make that a career over music
6095264 its difficult to get to know people in the art community if you dont already have an in
6095265 just as it can be difficult to meet people in other aspects of life in boston
6095266 people tend to be reserved and hard to get to know at times
6095267 luckily i have a network of friends and family here who are very supportive of my art
6095268 never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few

6095286 as a young teenager i loved to read and had very romantic notions about what it meant to be writer still my self image didnt leave room for me to even dream about becoming one myself
6095287 when i got the idea to explore the ways in which we continue to define and limit ourselves by our childhood labels i knew i had the beginnings of a novel i would want to read
6095288 i think bev the title character in the smart one needs a lot of hours on an analysts couch
6095289 im a morning person and feel like i can do anything if i get a good jump on the day so i wake up around 5 am before the children rise and get to work
6095290 but i have to brag because i know ellen from several venues first of all we have the same agency representing our books the jane rotrosen agency different agents both fabulous in their own rights but same amazing agency ellen and i have e chatted about how lucky we are to have such great agents behind us and our books
6095291 my new novel the smart one is a sister story with a plot inspired by a real life crime that happened in my home town and while i didnt intend to use the actual facts of the case in my fictional story i wanted a good handle on what really happened and so i telephoned the police detective who worked on the case and had an uh interesting conversation
6095292 this book has it all great cover faboo hook gorgeous author see web site link its definitely on my list
6095293 relationships at its core that is what ellen meisters the smart one is about through non stop action and descriptive language that not only puts you in the scenes physically but emotionally meister unravels a spellbinding story with wit and panache
6095294 this book was fast paced and well written although the characters experienced tough and sometimes unlikely situations and spent time talking about a wide range of feelings there was humor wit and an honesty about life that kept it from ever becoming morose or gloomy
6095295 are we destined to live out our childhood labels in ellen meisters new book the smart one three sisters battle to become more than their childhood identities
6095296 the smart one a harperscollins release is a bit chick lit a bit funny and a bit mystery in short it is definitely worth checking out if any of these things are your thing
6095297 i enjoyed following the fast paced story line made possible by meisters skilled and witty writing
6095298 first off let me just say that there is one section of dialogue in this book that had me laughing so hard that i was almost crying i cant remember the last time that a book did that for me if ever
6095299 if youre looking for a smart summer read pick up the smart one by ellen meister this tale of three sisters who rise about their pre assigned family roles in a time of crisis is engaging and witty
6095300 the smart one by ellen meister is a book about three sisters and their struggle to live together despite their very contrasting differences it is also a book filled with suspense and humor and i personally had to giggle out loud quite a few times while reading this entertaining novel
6095301 i really enjoyed reading the smart one by ellen meister i was able to get into it right from the beginning what more could you ask for drugs sex and rock and roll along with murder and sibling rivalry even though the three sisters are all adults now i found it a good read from beginning to end
6095302 a delightful read this novel is filled with twists and turns nothing is quite as it seems and although i am a murder mystery writer i did not guess who the murderer was or maybe i did
6095303 every time i tried to put the book down i wanted to read one more chapter or page to see if my guessing was getting any closer to the authors conclusion of the story but i was always letting her lead me down another primrose path
6095304 i loved it and encourage others to read this book
6095305 id like to tell you my favorite part of the novel but doing so would ruin the very reason for reading it i found this book a good read and a quick read finishing it in only 2 days
6095306 if youre looking for a smart humorous story about families look no further the smart one by ellen meister is a down to earth story that made me wish i had a sister of my own

6095308 many readers who read a novel on the blog are buying the hard copies because they want to keep it it is hard to read a serially released novel everyday also those who dont read a novel online are choosing the book because of familiarity jang eutteum a marketing manager of the

6095322 over the last week weve seen sen obamas lead in the poll of polls cut in half
6095323 this change was likely driven by a renewed focus on foreign policy after russias invasion of georgia as well as by sen mccains willingness to launch more aggressive attacks against obama on issues such as off shore drilling
6095324 the big question now is whether obama can successfully regain control of the campaign agenda as we head into the democratic convention
6095325 the expression of rootedness a sense of place and of history a sense of self derived from forebears kin and culture an identity that is both collective and personal
6095326 is designed to obscure the fact that it is a recent ideological creation of post cold war politics
6095327 a series of trenches dug in defense of last years revolution
6095328 the survival and enhancement of a particular people and its institutionalized cultural expressions
6095329 culture of families linked by friendship common enemies and common projects
6095330 a clear sense of what southern grandmothers have always meant in admonishing children we dont do that
6095331 a body of wisdom and truth and a set of attitudes and behavior handed down from one generation to another it is our parents respect for their grandfathers that we reflect when we refuse to think ourselves wiser than our ancestors and do not presume to condemn their shortcomings

6095339 a man and a woman living in a socially sanctioned bond called marriage for the purposes of propagating and rearing children sharing intimacy and resources and conserving lineage property and tradition
6095340 real alternatives to the centralized corporate state that are compatible with liberty and family life
6095341 packaged around a militant secular individualism but still seeking to build a marriage free post family order
6095342 defend the moral order rooted in the old and new testament and natural law
6095343 the deepest problems in our society are not economic or political but moral
6095344 an ideological clique forever splitting into sects still smaller and odder but rarely conjugating
6095345 a particularistic politics of states rights and localism which they combine with a cultural and social criticism defined by christian and patriarchal organicism
6095346 black and white southerners of good will should be left alone to work out their destinies avoiding before it is too late the urban hell that has been created by the lawyers social engineers and imperial bureaucrats who have grown rich on programs that have done nothing to help anyone but themselves
6095347 aristotle recognized that a well ordered society protected an ascending order of good through the institutionalization of rank
6095348 we are old church and old right antimperialist and antinterventionist disbelievers in pax americana
6095349 the break between the national review and the paleoconservatives is no tempest in a teapot
6095350 it may well determine the direction of american foreign policy for decades to come
6095351 the u s was then clearly on its way to becoming a self identified multicultural society overseen by a post christian managerial elite
6095352 in theory the cold warriors were protecting the people of britain france and the united states against the expansion of an evil empire but nations can only be successfully defended by people who believe in nationhood which is anathema to the liberal assumptions that are the foundation of most western states
6095353 moral visions are the mere accompaniments of the process by which classes make themselves economically dominant and try to control other groups
6095354 the laws and decrees enacted by human government are mutable and sometimes tyrannical
6095355 the laws of human nature worked tight within the spirals of the genetic code are unchanging and just
6095356 a revolution against human nature and against the most basic elements of human society

6095375 weve heard how the value of the dollar affects gas prices and indeed the price of everything i was pleased that my request for a hearing on such was granted by the financial services committee and we were able to hear some very informative testimony certainly domestic policies regarding off shore oil drilling bans ethanol mandates refining capacity and cafe standards are interventionist and harmful enough in the energy market but how does foreign policy affect gas prices

6095414 what government should be focused on is raising the incomes and the aspirations and the opportunities for the millions of people who are stuck on low incomes and that is where this government has failed not because they are bad people not because they dont have noble ambitions but because their measure which is entirely reliant on the state which is about redistribution has failed failed on their own terms
6095415 our education system is failing to spread opportunity our welfare system is keeping people out of work our tax system makes it extremely difficult for those on low incomes to get off those low incomes because those marginal tax rates are so high
6095416 labour has failed it has created a more unfair society and i think there is a real opportunity for the conservative party now to lead this debate
6095417 we will keep tax credits but we will add to the battle on poverty other things like welfare reform like extending educational opportunity like supporting families and these conservative methods of achieving progressive goals are likely to be far more successful and create a fairer society
6095418 at the moment borrowing is rising and thats a real issue
6095419 george osbornes restaurant has a menu without prices there is something for everyone but no one has to pay
6095420 what passes for conservative policy is nothing but a series of hopelessly vague ambitions
6095421 they would rather repeatedly tell us that we are broken than say what they would do to fix things the only genuine policy they have is a tax break for the richest 6 of people
6095422 its time for the conservatives to realise that power must be earned not inherited and to start setting out some serious policies
6095423 if this is the best the tories can do to claim they are a party of fairness then the labour party is delighted that the battle will be joined on this issue
6095424 george osbornes speech shows we are fighting a tory party that for all the talk of change is still committed to the old unfair policies
6095425 george osborne offers empty rhetoric on child poverty now but people will remember that this is the same shadow chancellor whose flagship tax policy diverts 1bn to the 3 000 richest estates in the country
6095426 and this is the same tory party that opposed the minimum wage opposed pension credit and the winter fuel allowance opposed support for families through tax credits and still wont commit to any real pledge on child poverty

6095429 en el congreso la derecha tiene mayor a la candidatura de lugo cont con el respaldo del partido liberal radical aut ntico plra de ideolog a de derecha y representante de terratenientes
6095430 ellos van a defender sus intereses y no van a aceptar ninguna ocupaci n de tierras ni reducci n de los latifundios
6095431 lugo est en una posici n m s de izquierda ya sali a decir que cree que las ocupaciones de tierras son leg timas como ltima instancia en la negociaci n pol tica y respalda la lucha de los campesinos por una reforma agraria integral sin embargo creemos que se va a encontrar con muchas contradicciones va a tener que asumir algunos acuerdos con la burgues a por ello el movimiento social se est preparando para apoyar las posiciones del presidente lugo y llegado el momento presionar para que se concreten los cambios
6095432 ni bien gan lugo los compa eros se organizaron y empezaron a ocupar tierras especialmente en el norte del pa s donde hay una zona muy conflictiva y donde el movimiento campesino est m s organizado e ideologizado
6095433 el an lisis realizado por nuestro movimiento es que este no es un momento estrat gico para presionar no se puede presionar al gobierno saliente que no va ofrecer garant as ni soluciones y tampoco al entrante al que hay que darle un poco de tiempo para ver si efectivamente cumple con lo que ha prometido
6095434 creo si que los compa eros en el interior est n preparados para ocupar como una medida de fuerza que me parece correcto y creo que el movimiento campesino est lo suficientemente maduro pol ticamente para tratar primero de agotar las instancias institucionales para despu s en caso de que no se cumpla con lo prometido comenzar a presionar
6095435 tambi n hay una presi n sobre todo de los medios de comunicaci n para crear en la opini n p blica una opini n desfavorable al gobierno de lugo creando temor y miedo
6095436 cuando el gobierno act e tocando intereses pol ticos fuertes la oposici n e incluso el partido liberal integrante de la coalici n de gobierno va a presionar para defender sus privilegios van a tratar de desestabilizar sectores para defender esos privilegios
6095437 y es b sicamente por eso que creo que mucho del peso pol tico que va a tener lugo depender de si puede llevar a cabo una reforma agraria integral
6095438 hay casi un mill n de empleados p blicos una clase media que vive directa o indirectamente de los recursos del estado
6095439 esas estructuras represivas siguen existiendo y lamentablemente ser dificil romperlas hoy d a los compa eros siguen siendo torturados en las c rceles del interior siguen siendo secuestrados por la polic a est n presos en situaci n ilegal siendo ocurriendo asesinatos pol ticos el a o pasado nos asesinaron a un compa ero y en lo que va de este a o han asesinados otros dos compa eros del movimiento y esto en un marco de democracia de elecciones y de libertad de expresi n
6095440 por sobre todo la acci n del nuevo gobierno estar focalizada en que los ministerios sean eficaces en sus gesti n que la salud la educaci n funcionen hay que recordar que en 61 a os en el poder el partido colorado ha creado una maquinaria impresionante de asistencial smo usando los recursos del estado en su beneficio y distribuyendo empleos p blicos y van a defender sus privilegios
6095441 espero que ojala se cumpla con lograr que los servicios del estado funcionen debidamente eso ser a un buen primer paso
6095442 en los ltimos a os el movimiento social se ha fortalecido ha logrado parar las privatizaciones la ley antiterrorista y fundamentalmente es el movimiento campesino el que m s capacidad de movilizaci n tiene creo que los compa eros del movimiento social est n conscientes de la necesidad de defender la institucionalidad en este momento
6095443 se logr acumular bastante fuerza y constituirse en el movimiento que present y apoy la candidatura de fernando lugo despu s en el trabajo se lograron acordar algunos proyectos program ticos lamentablemente en las discusiones program ticas en la coalici n fueron mimetizadas
6095444 ahora el gran desaf o es hacer un buen trabajo en los ministerios lograr una buena gesti n pero sin negligenciar el movimiento social de base que dio apoyo y crecimiento a todo esto
6095445 tomaron distancia del movimiento social concentr ndose sus cuadros en ocupar los lugares del gobierno y eso no permiti que el propio partido se dinamice
6095446 el gran desaf o seguir creciendo con la base seguir formando y construyendo el poder popular que es lo nico que nos va a garantizar un movimiento social ideologizado que nos va a permitir en el futuro y creo que es v lido para toda am rica latina poner freno a pol ticas neoliberales capitalistas para mi la nica forma concretar un cambio social estructural es constuyendo el poder popular
6095447 estas leyes promulgadas est n apegadas a la constituci n
6095448 el jefe de estado s est facultado para dictar leyes org nicas cumpliendo el requerimiento de enviarlas a la sala constitucional del tribunal supremo de justicia tsj
6095449 en 2007 se publicaron 20 leyes muchas de stas a la espera de la propuesta de reforma constitucional que al no darse se tuvieron que reformular las legislaciones de manera que se mantuvieran dentro del texto constitucional vigente
6095450 estuve tentado a titular este art culo de manera distinta por ejemplo
6095451 en venezuela en mi punto de vista vivimos cambios intensos mas no una revoluci n todav a hay muchas cosas del pasado mucho lastre que no logramos superar la trama heredada opera como controlador del proceso y tardar tiempo para que sus logros se perciban con nitidez y se consoliden pero estamos viviendo tiempos de cambio estos se est n dando y quiz sea ste el rasgo m s significativo en libertad y en democracia con arreglo al estado de derecho consagrado en la constituci n de 1999
6095452 esos cambios tropiezan a cada instante con poderosos obst culos obst culos que colocan en el camino grupos econ micos poderes transnacionales viejos h bitos pol ticos y en general un pasado cargado de negatividad de revanchismo y la voluntad de garantizarse a como d lugar que las cosas sigan siendo como eran
6095453 la facultad del parlamento de habilitar al jefe del estado para dictar decretos con fuerza de ley siempre estuvo consagrada en el ordenamiento constitucional venezolano y la ejercieron los gobiernos en diferentes etapas de nuestra historia no es una novedad y menos a n un golpe de estado o una violaci n de la carta magna como algunos lo plantean
6095454 lo que sucede es que ahora se legisla con otro signo con otra orientaci n pero los 26 decretos leyes aprobados por ch vez en el marco de la habilitaci n que le otorg la asamblea nacional son inobjetables la otorg con la mayor a requerida la representaci n popular y la ejerce un presidente electo por el pueblo
6095455 va en el mismo dise o de los proyectos de 2001 con las leyes habilitantes que estaban destinadas a una mayor injerencia del estado y adem s lesionar la propiedad privada
6095456 aqu el problema no es el control del estado de las instituciones es la confiscaci n la ocupaci n de los espacios sociales y por eso se habla de un neototalitarismo que es distinto a la dictadura pol tica
6095457 que el mandatario venezolano tras decretar la semana pasada leyes que fueron rechazadas en el referendo de 2007 sobre una reforma constitucional inici nuevos pasos para implementar el socialismo en el pa s y lograr la reelecci n continua
6095458 el presidente de la rep blica con la participaci n del tribunal supremo de justicia han desconocido la constituci n vigente han pisoteado el estado de derecho han impedido el derecho a la participaci n han aplicado una sistem tica estrategia de desinformaci n han actuado de manera arbitraria ilegal y contra el inter s y la opini n del pa s
6095459 26 leyes que el gobierno aprob en las ltimas horas aprueban las mismas cosas y peores a las que el pueblo venezolano dijo no el 2 de diciembre
6095460 eres la l rica bandera cuando en rondas galponeras un payador misionero en un sapucay de guerrero te evoca de mil maneras

6095462 somos peregrinos de lejanas tierras llegamos cargados de hondas penas
6095463 espa a tiene mucho que aprender de los inmigrantes bolivianos y stos tienen mucho que aportar si acaso mantienen su identidad cultural
6095464 bailo con devoci n y agradecimiento a la virgen porque sue o con volver a mi pa s s lo eso le pido
6095465 aqu no hay ni cambas ni collas hay s lo bolivianos
6095466 en medio de los bolivianos me siento m s boliviano parece que estuviera en bolivia estos momentos y espacios de encuentro fortalecen m s mi identidad boliviana hemos inmigrado dejando lo que m s queremos para que a bolivia le vaya bien pero ahora en bolivia est n peleando unos contra otros eso duele
6095467 esta ha sido una negociaci n entre dos aliados y amigos cercanos y a pesar de que han habido altibajos naturalmente a lo largo de todo el proceso nos gratifica que ambas delegaciones hayan tratado esto en el esp ritu de intentar hacer algo que es importante para la seguridad de ambos pa ses y como aliados y amigos
6095468 lo que suceda en los pr ximos d as y meses determinar el futuro de las relaciones entre estados unidos y rusia pero del mismo modo mi opini n personal es que tienen que haber consecuencias para las acciones que rusia ha tomado contra un estado soberano
6095469 acuso al gobierno ruso de adoptar una pol tica de limpieza tnica y puedo probarlo con organizaciones internacionales que ya est n dando testimonio de lo que digo y recibimos 1 400 denuncias de ataques brutales asesinatos violaciones e internaci n de personas en violaci n de la convenci n de ginebra y del derecho humanitario internacional
6095470 como ya he dicho de acuerdo con el c digo de las naciones unidas estamos intentando imponer la paz a georgia que empez la agresi n consideramos que esta t ctica es muy efectiva y es la nica posible perm tanme recordarles que en la historia hemos visto muchos ejemplos de pacificaci n del agresor de esta manera los pa ses occidentales lo hicieron hace 70 a os y conocen las tr gicas consecuencias de eso quiero decir la lecci n del tratado de munich de 1938
6095471 rusia invadi un estado vecino soberano y amenaza a un gobierno democr tico electo por su pueblo
6095472 entendemos que el actual liderazgo de georgia es un proyecto especial de estados unidos pero un d a estados unidos tendr que elegir entre defender su prestigio por sobre un proyecto o una sociedad real que requiera acciones conjuntas

6095562 that puts him squarely in the gop foreign policy arena but im not sure it should be grounds for removal
6095563 no because i also agree that dissent within the party is a good thing

6095566 re petition to expel lieberman from caucus to be delivered tomorrow
6095567 members of his own party voted him out of office i do not see how stripping him of his powers within the democratic party which he decided to leave after those voters voted him out is fascist
6095568 lets say im a member of an anti fur group
6095569 when he decided to be a sore loser and run as an independent democrat against ned lamont

6095609 the producers said that they wouldnt use the original songs for the remake instead they will be having new songs to feature
6095610 oh really thats a waste of money understand that im not making this as a total comparison but it would be like saying hey lets go remake casablanca you should just leave those things alone
6095611 why would anyone want to do a remake of a cult classic
6095612 qui n puede reivindicar un derecho a recibir el cuerpo de cristo todo es un acto sin medida del amor de dios nuestro se or se hace l mismo disponible en su cuerpo y en su sangre pero no podemos decir jam s que tenemos el derecho de recibirlo en la santa comuni n cada vez que nos acercamos a l debemos hacerlo con una profunda conciencia de nuestra indignidad
6095613 recibir indignamente el cuerpo y la sangre de cristo es un sacrilegio si lo hace deliberadamente en pecado mortal es un sacrilegio
6095614 si tenemos un pecado mortal en la conciencia debemos primero confesarnos de ese pecado y recibir la absoluci n y s lo despu s acercarnos al sacramento eucar stico
6095615 funcionario p blico que con conocimiento y consentimiento sostiene acciones que est n contra la ley moral divina y eterna por ejemplo si apoya p blicamente el aborto procurado que comporta la supresi n de vidas humanas inocentes e indefensas una persona que comete pecado de esta manera debe ser amonestada p blicamente de modo que no reciba la comuni n hasta que no haya reformado la propia vida
6095616 si una persona que ha sido amonestada persiste en un pecado mortal p blico y se acerca a recibir la comuni n el ministro de la eucarist a tiene la obligaci n de neg rsela por qu sobre todo por la salvaci n de la persona misma impidi ndole realizar un sacrilegio
6095617 en primer lugar un esc ndalo referente a nuestra disposici n para recibir la santa comuni n
6095618 se debe evitar que la gente sea inducida a pensar que se puede estar en estado de pecado mortal y acercarse a la eucarist a en segundo lugar podr a existir otra forma de esc ndalo consistente en llevar a la gente a pensar que el acto p blico que esta persona est haciendo que hasta ahora todos cre an que era un pecado serio no lo es tanto si la iglesia le permite recibir la comuni n
6095619 si tenemos una figura p blica que abierta y deliberadamente sostiene los derechos abortistas y que recibe la eucarist a qu terminar pensando la gente com n puede llegar a creer que es correcto hasta cierto punto suprimir una vida inocente en el seno materno
6095620 no tiene ninguna intenci n de interferir en la vida p blica sino en el estado espiritual del pol tico o del funcionario p blico que si es cat lico debe seguir la ley divina tambi n en la esfera p blica
6095621 por tanto es simplemente rid culo y equivocado tratar de silenciar a un pastor acus ndolo de interferir en pol tica para que no pueda hacer el bien al alma de un miembro de su grey
6095622 dar testimonio de nuestra fe no s lo en lo privado de nuestros hogares sino tambi n en nuestra vida p blica con los dem s para dar un fuerte testimonio de cristo

6095669 incredible performance by usain bolt once again he finished up in an incredible time this was an incredible performance he wanted that record
6095670 he got an incredible start i looked at his start and just went wow it was more amazing than the 100 metres guys that tall should not be able to start like that
6095671 he wanted that record this is his favourite event he went for it he came in focused on it knowing he would most likely win the gold
6095672 the best values from trusted sellers become better and better
6095673 i have no control i have to comply with anything they choose to do and i have no voice in the matter
6095674 id be giving up a months income to get that done thats the only thing thats keeping me on ebay the inconvenience of leaving
6095675 i talk to other people who have done what i did and theyre happy with their decision theyve been able to get their business to the ebay business levels or beyond
6095676 many times you feel like theyre really pushing it to see if youll give them some kind of a refund
6095677 theyll float the suggestion that this isnt exactly what i expected
6095678 when ebay makes these dramatic changes it can make you very nervous
6095679 but again ebay is doing what ebay believes it has to do to protect its marketplace
6095680 canadian independent power producer stocks that we follow have been hit hard over the past several months down 30 per cent on average
6095681 recently however many of them have partially rebounded with one notable exception being khd in our opinion we think its share price being left behind is unwarranted and presents a buying opportunity
6095682 on a relative valuation basis canadian hydro developers looks quite attractive given the high revenue ebitda and eps growth we expect khd to realize over the next several years we think these multiples are somewhat low
6095683 historically we had given up to 1 a share of value for dunvegan that we reduced over time to reflect chronic delays on a final decision taking a closer look we think the total value could one day approach 1 50 a share
6095684 we believe that there is no pending transaction to increase its share count and to possibly dilute its future eps potential
6095685 america is being overrun by an invasion force from mexico
6095686 for more than a decade the audiences for most traditional news sources have steadily declined as the number of people getting news online has surged
6095687 a sizable minority of americans find themselves at the intersection of these two long standing trends in news consumption

6095692 i can guarantee you that there are people in the bush administration who are studying the use of surveillance technologies being developed here and have at least skeletal plans to implement them at home
6095693 we can already see it in new york with cctv cameras once you have the cameras in place you have the infrastructure for a powerful tracking system im worried about what this will mean if the u s government goes totalitarian and starts employing these technologies more than they are already im worried about the threat this poses to american democracy
6095694 would do what they are doing here in a heartbeat if he could
6095695 we owe it to our families to do the right thing
6095696 parents of those young adults will have an option to give their children access to adequate health care
6095697 this also invites thousands of additional healthy young adults into insurance pools which can have a positive benefit for everyone
6095698 there are hundreds of thousands who have the option to buy coverage in the private market now that have failed to do so
6095699 if theres just one person whos unhealthy the rates can skyrocket for everyone
6095700 and if theres one thing we know about the insurance industry its that they arent going to pay an extra dime
6095701 i thought we played well particularly in the second half with the wind our half back line was good we were first to the ball in midfield quite often so thats encouraging
6095702 well be trying to have all the lads together again but obviously well be heading to mcgrath park to win it wed be hoping to improve on the shooting anyway as well
6095703 we were at sixes and sevens basically we didnt work hard enough and when a team is running at you we need players working hard around the middle and we didnt have it
6095704 i was not concerned about the second half performance as we knew that fenagh would come back at us they had a few goal chances but that happens and we defended well
6095705 it was a big improvement from the last game everyone worked hard and pulled together we were sharp and the young lads such as geoffrey odonoghue did well all the subs who came in contributed which is good overall
6095706 we predicted a low scoring game and we got four goal scoring chances and we didnt take any we werent cute enough and we will have to keep going now we have to regroup for our match with tinryland next week
6095707 billy and daragh did well and while they might be new to the champion ship set up they are not new to the club they have been around in the club for the last number of years
6095708 it was always going to be a tough one for us they play hard and fair and our attitude was better than the last time we were out when our attitude was chronic it comes down to good attitude but having said that if old leighlin had forwards and taken their chances we would have been in trouble tonight
6095709 scooby paul reid came back and scored a nice point he had a bit of work to do on his fitness and would be a loss to any club john reid had a masterful display tonight and his work rate was excellent
6095710 they were better and fitter and faster for us it will be difficult for us now we have a tough match against kildavin next week and it will be difficult to motivate ourselves but we will have to do it
6095711 we are just trying to get back into the swing of things the bite has gone out of us we are trying to hold things together while the county players were gone we werent sharp and were off the pace we were second for the ball and it wasnt a game that we will be proud of
6095712 last year we had only one win in the whole championship and one draw we worked hard and playing out of division 1 was a great help the win against palatine didnt do us any harm the other night either having said that we have to regroup now and we have a match on thursday night
6095713 shes a very good player she played well yesterday shes a great asset to the team
6095714 i wasnt impressed at all you wouldnt see it at a mens final
6095715 g was apparent as trainer ken hickey explained after the game
6095716 we havent had a game in two months and the long gap showed we have a big panel of players and at this stage it is hard to keep lads motivated
6095717 david played well and while he hasnt been with us the whole year he came in and fitted in he took his scores very well
6095718 it is a game we should have won we have a lot of good young players coming through we had a few chances and we took wrong options we need to be more composed on the ball and we werent we got it going in the last few minutes we got a few points but we missed some as well
6095719 i was involved with kerry but i am teaching in bagenalstown for the last 25 years
6095720 we were allowed to go to a neighbouring county and joe nolan and paschal doran of laois are playing with us
6095721 we train on saturday and the turn out has been very good paddy is a very astute man on the line and has made a big difference he takes over on the line and calls the shots
6095722 pjs stick was a big help and id like to thank barry hickey of aib in carlow for organising that
6095723 hes a real handson sponsor was up the mountain with the competitors full of enthusiasm and helpful advice though he is worried he may not be able to go up the cooleys himself next year
6095724 we went asleep before the throw in against myshall the other night in a qualifying match but hopefully we will be awake when we meet again in the semi final
6095725 27 of our guys are in galway next weekend and we told the county board about this nearly three months ago its not as though we just sprung it on them for some of the lads it will be their third match in a week after waiting so long since the naomh eoin game
6095726 we had some dreadful defending early on giving away the two goals as easily as we did leighlinbridge are always a problem for ballon but we werent expecting things to be so bad by that stage
6095727 we were on top in the second half but we just werent able to put up the scores overall a draw was probably justified with games that tight theyll always be physical and its often like that in the championship
6095728 wed a great start but our backs were a bit shaky both sides gave it everything so the draw was probably the fairest result
6095729 for athletes so young especially anya and tricia who are only 11 and 12 years old their level of hard work and discipline is excellent and one of the main reasons they have been so successful this summer
6095730 i expect all the girls to do very well at their international competitions and hopefully make finals there is a lot of hard work ahead now but the girls are ready for it
6095731 people need to know t he way ulster bank is dealing with customers and the problems accessing your own money
6095732 they asked me if i had any id on me but i hadnt
6095733 since then no one has been able to tell me whats wrong wit h the draft i have absolutely no explanation for it
6095734 ive no difficulty with anyone making a mistake but this is just a litany of mistakes one after another
6095735 a big provincial town like carlow should have a full banking service and ulster bank should rethink their position if they wish to be taken seriously as a business bank in carlow

6095743 these people have uploaded games and made them available to tens of thousands of people
6095744 what they are trying to do is deter people from illegally filesharing their games this is not a massive revenue generating exercise
6095745 its almost unbelievably easy to do your own thing beautifully with artex paints
6095746 they told me to take some panadol and id be fine
6095747 i was screaming in agony because this unbearable pain kept shooting down from my neck thro ugh my shoulder and to my le ft arm but t hey just kept saying youll be fine why are you screaming youll be fin e when you go home
6095748 i was crying my heart out and i was so frightened because i just didnt understand why they said i was fine when i knew i wasnt

6095753 researchers analyzed data from nearly 80 000 military personnel including more than 11 000 who were sent to iraq and afghanistan they looked at whether deployment and combat exposure were linked with new alcohol problems such as binge drinking and found that more than 600 combat troops who reported no binge drinking at the start of the study developed the problem after deployment and combat exposure
6095754 new patterns of regular heavy drinking and alcohol problems such as missing work because of drinking occurred more often in national guard and reserve troops who experienced combat their risk of developing new drinking problems compared to guardsmen and reservists who werent deployed was about 60 percent higher
6095755 more than half of veterans who took their own lives after returning from iraq or afghanistan were members of the national guard or reserves
6095756 iraq was the most common deployment location for both suicides and attempts
6095757 active duty service members have 1 2 million dependents aged 23 years and younger many of those serving have had at least 2 to 4 deployments some lasting 18 months about 44 percent of active duty troops have children nearly two fifths of whom are aged 5 years or younger
6095758 have 660 000 children and adolescents younger than 22 years and their families face similar strains from deployment about 38 percent of the selected reserve force have children one fifth of whom are aged 5 years or younger
6095759 we worry about the corrosive impact of stress with multiple deployments as soldiers are redeployed spouses at home may develop increased anxiety and potentially pay less attention to childrens needs
6095760 researchers found the rate of child maltreatment through neglect or physical emotional or sexual abuse in families of us army enlisted soldiers was 42 percent higher during combat deployment than in nondeployment
6095761 the rate of child maltreatment by female civilian spouses was significantly elevated
6095762 re screening of 88 235 us soldiers several months after their return from iraq identified a large cohort whose mental health problems were missed on initial screening
6095763 clinicians identified 20 3 percent of active and 42 4 percent of reserve component soldiers who needed mental health treatment at the second screening concerns about interpersonal conflict increased 4 fold
6095764 there is no such thing as an injured service member
6095765 marines were at increased odds of continue go binge drink after deployment as well as to experience new onset alcohol related problems
6095766 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6095767 was a creation of the jihadist culture of the pakistani army
6095768 we are trying our best to come out of this critical situation without any damage to afghanistan and the taliban
6095769 that one retired general who had worked with khan told them there was no question that khan had acted with the full knowledge of the military leadership
6095770 it would be best if the arrest or killing of any hvt high value target were announced on 26 27 or 28 july

6095773 because it is such a feature rich device people are using more of the functions than they would on a smartphone type device
6095774 traditional mobile phones have been designed to cope just with voice and sms the iphone came along with lots of data intensive applications and features and they naturally consume more battery power
6095775 it is going to be trial and error at this stage
6095776 they have accelerometers in there so they can detect if the phone has moved at all if it hasnt moved there is no need to get an update from the gps
6095777 apples value is all about the software they dont need cutting edge technology to do it
6095778 you can see by the number of architectural licences that we have that we dont go out of our way to sell them
6095779 if they found a way of really reducing the power dissipation such that other companies had to go to a new generation of silicon to get the same power reduction that would allow apple to stay on a lower cost technology for longer
6095780 the car companies have done the same thing if you are cruising down the highway they shut down four out of the eight cylinders to save fuel
6095781 for this sort of chip it could take anywhere from one year to two years to get to having the first test chips its closer to three years before i would expect to see an iphone that had any kind of apple designed chip in there
6095782 there are a lot of smart people focusing on low power at a lot of companies
6095783 if i want flavored water ill just suck on a lollipop
6095784 in the olympics we recognize that its possible for two competitors to both be perfect 10s a judge who feels that way can give both athletes the top score americans dont have that option in the voting booth even if you like two candidates you can vote for only one this is the root of the spoiler effect whenever two candidates base of support overlaps like al gore and ralph nader in 2000 voters who like both have to choose one and sometimes that prevents the most popular candidate from winning its happened at least five times in u s presidential elections one possible reform is to use a rating system much like that used in the olympics some have criticized scoring systems as complicated but people use them online all the time now rating videos and books on youtube and amazon both computer simulations and some real world trials have made a strong case that rating systems do the best job of reflecting voter sentiment
6095785 no matter when such election reforms are more widely enacted theres no good reason why pollsters shouldnt conduct some polls giving people greater choices right now
6095786 that blowhard needs to close his yap or lose his job
6095787 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
6095788 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
6095789 cannot quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment
6095790 senator mccain now argues that despite these costly strategic errors his judgment has been vindicated due to the results of the surge
6095791 in iraq gains have been made in lowering the level of violence thanks to the outstanding efforts of our military the increasing capability of iraqs security forces the cease fire of shiite militias and the decision taken by sunni tribes to take the fight to al qaeda
6095792 understand what the essential argument was about before the surge i argued that the long term solution in iraq is political the iraqi government must reconcile its differences and take responsibility for its future that holds true today
6095793 he is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
6095794 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not he said that i am for a path of retreat and failure and he declared that behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has many times before that i put personal ambition before my country
6095795 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
6095796 the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
6095797 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border
6095798 instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people
6095799 the fact that mccain is a westerner from a nearby state will be offset by the democratic mood of the nation thereby making the race really competitive in the west
6095800 if obamas able to win in these states it will have more to do with national trends against the republican party manifesting themselves than with political and demographic changes on the ground
6095801 that national shift has to be great enough to upset the historical pattern of these states tending to vote republican for president
6095802 this has been a difficult year for most of us in many different ways
6095803 the votes going to be tight theres no denying that
6095804 i really think there are enough people who i dont want to say fear barack obama but just dont know him and will end up voting for mccain
6095805 hes focused about the workers and what he wants for our future
6095806 we see him on the news but we dont pay much attention to him
6095807 well ah ah i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective
6095808 answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
6095809 this is something that i have not i think come to a firm resolution on i think its very hard to know what that means when life begins is it when a cell separates is it when the soul stirs so i dont presume to know the answer to that question what i know as ive said before is that there is something extraordinarily powerful about potential life and that has a moral weight to it that we take into consideration when were having these debates
6095810 im not sure if there are human beings in there but go ahead and blow it up
6095811 you guys obviously dont know kenny from the 70s 80s or 90s ill give him the fact that hes a great bowler but thats it maybe hes changed in this decade but i cant forget knowing him for all those years
6095812 the challenge for west virginia the challenge for coal producing states and nations is that as historically produced coal is a dirty fuel and is regarded as a dirty fuel
6095813 and there are environmental issues associated with the production and consumption of coal
6095814 if you want to do energy well in an environmentally sound fashion go to west virginia go to appalachia
6095815 we all win in that equation thats our great opportunity
6095816 the physically reality is that we cannot bridge to the future for decades if not hundreds of years without coal as part of the equation
6095817 if you accept that premise then your choices are how do we do coal well how do we do coal clean how do we capture the opportunities for coal
6095818 carbon sequestration is going to double the cost of coal fired power
6095819 one of the coal presidents said it is at least 15 maybe 20 years away from being commercially viable
6095820 there are a myriad of legal issues that are unresolved whos going to take the liability if it comes back out of the ground and the energy it takes ive heard estimates it could take 15 or 20 of the power of the power plant makes to strip out the co 2 thats going to raise the cost of electricity
6095821 im not sure that we can really appease the individuals that want to see coal eliminated abolished from the energy mix of this country
6095822 but those individuals and groups that have concerns about the environment or the impacts of mining certainly we can be more responsive to those concerns
6095823 right now we dont have a comprehensive bill out there
6095824 we havent been allowed to vote on anything that i think is going to address high gasoline prices and dependence on foreign oil and any time we do get something its a fight to get anything related to coal in there
6095825 weve been on this path for the last few years
6095826 theres no doubt this year has seen some very very bold changes necessarily so and entirely reflective of what our buyers and sellers want
6095827 i dont think anything can surpass ebay in terms of choice but e commerce is now mainstream we see our competitive set as a broad one anywhere where a buyer can buy stuff online that might be amazon or the more traditional bricks and clicks but the big advantage we have is choice mums sitting alongside entrepreneurs sitting alongside big retailers
6095828 i think theres room for everybody at the end of the day having big brands on there helps legitimise ebay as a marketplace having big retailers on there makes it more exciting as a buying experience
6095829 we hope to see significant increase in the choice our sellers give to buyers
6095830 if you are a buyer and searching on ebay youll have far more chance of finding what you are looking for in a credit crunch environment its far easier to shop around online for a bargain than it is offline
6095831 any change to the site that benefits one seller automatically disadvantages others the sellers who are disadvantaged will always shout the loudest
6095832 ebay has realised there is quite a lot of fear among sellers
6095833 they are realising that sellers are ebay customers too and listening to their customers
6095834 people forget the internet has changed when ebay started out a lot was taken on trust and people were sending envelopes stuffed with dollars across the atlantic now with instant payments buyers are expecting better service and almost instant delivery
6095835 if ebay doesnt take steps to ensure its sellers are providing the right level of service and customer satisfaction it will fail buyers will go to amazon or argos instead amazon is doing really well and sellers are flocking to amazon you can buy almost anything on ebay the challenge is to make sure you can carry on doing that and maintain a good level of service its a hard tightrope to walk
6095836 we must work at our responsibility as parents as if everything in life counted on it because in fact everything in life does count on it
6095837 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6095838 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6095839 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6095840 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6095841 trying so hard to be perfect that it is stultifying
6095842 if obama gets elected and there is nothing funny about him it wont be the economy thats depressed it will be the rest of us
6095843 ive looked down the barrel of an m 16 at an enemy of our nation put him in my sights and squeezed the trigger you never have and anyone anyone who thinks ill do any less to our enemies today knows nothing about who i really am
6095844 how do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake
6095845 this generation of prosperity had put millions of americans in new homes and millions of new cars on our roads
6095846 president richard nixon also called for greater efficiency standards at the federal level and for exploration of energy using the best options they had at the time extracting oil from shale and tar sands and developing cleaner coal technology
6095847 but when the same demagogues in the middle east who created the supply shortage decided to increase supply once again all the initiatives to use less and produce more energy were abandoned now 36 years later we again face a crisis an oil crisis a carbon crisis and a conservation crisis
6095848 the vehicles we drive have gotten bigger heavier and less efficient our homes have gotten larger and require ever more power to heat and cool our lives have become filled with new technologies that have changed the world for the better but increased the thirst for greater quantities of energy
6095849 this emergency far more complex than the one we faced three and a half decades ago harms our economy threatens our national security and pollutes to our environment
6095850 we are here today to accept the challenge of creating a clean energy revolution
6095851 the imperative is to end the drain of the american treasury both public and private which flow to the hands of volatile governments who control the worlds oil supply ultimately our vision is to bequeath to our children and our childrens children the livable planet that they deserve
6095852 if past is prologue and it is we know that this clean energy revolution will be complicated
6095853 so here in las vegas on august 19 2008 we are gathered gathered to share what we know where we are and what we do next
6095854 today in nevada there are 57 operating renewable energy projects producing 400 megawatts of electricity
6095855 our host the university of nevada las vegas is known for its high energy basketball and in the future it will be known as the leader in clean energy
6095856 look to nearby nellis air force base and you will find the worlds largest photovoltaic plant which provides more than 25 percent of the bases power
6095857 the first geothermal plant in america was built in nevada in 1984
6095858 unfortunately further work this year has been blocked by those creating a distraction by insisting that we talk about nothing but coastal drilling
6095859 even then it will be a drop in the global bucket
6095860 when people in the future look upon the polluted world of 2008 they will see a partnership of two politically differing individuals who came together to show responsible leadership
6095861 oil will be one part of our energy puzzle for years to come as we develop and produce the technologies that will one day render it unnecessary
6095862 congress should pass a long term extension of tax incentives for private sector entrepreneurs who are standing by ready to invest billions of dollars in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects
6095863 all of this will happen if we grasp the enormous economic opportunity this shift to renewables will create
6095864 for example if just 20 percent of our nations power came from renewables by 2020 we would create hundreds of thousands of direct jobs and save consumers many billions of dollars in lower bills
6095865 if we choose to embrace this challenge we can fundamentally change our world which will benefit every creature and person that inhabits it
6095866 we are taking the results and recommendations of this energy summit to the democratic and republican national conventions
6095867 and when we meet again next year i have every expectation that we will do so with a president a congress and a nation finally ready to fully embrace the great energy opportunities that lie ahead
6095868 i know theres no one who knows the subject matter that hes going to have to deal with better than john
6095869 his attitude toward the environment at pennfuture has been very angry
6095870 i think id characterize some of his views as extreme
6095871 theres no one i trust more than mary jo white in striking a balance
6095872 helped shape bills that were both tremendously positive for pennsylvania businesses and at the same time good for our environment
6095873 he starts off with some positives and starts off with a few negatives but i think he can work his way toward confirmation
6095874 i know exactly the difference between being an advocate in the private sector and having a public responsibility
6095875 whats important is working hard listening to everyone considering different views and trying to arrive at fair productive answers
6095876 view of economic development is through regulation litigation and taxation theyve supported so many taxes against our members i think the appointment is a concern for us
6095877 were certainly hopeful that the secretary designate despite the constituency he most recently represented will be able to shift gears and represent a broader constituency that includes us
6095878 all of these things are just incredibly expensive to the public while yielding almost no environmental benefit
6095879 if you cant compete with petroleum at 120 a barrel you cant compete
6095880 the whole concept of state government playing around in venture capital is nonsense
6095881 i think hes done an excellent job leading pennfuture and i think hell transfer all that experience and passion to his new position
6095882 pay any price bear any burden in the defense of liberty
6095883 democrats on the ground and their operators from the democratic national committee and the state organization and the gore campaign deliberately and systematically scrutinized for challenge every military absentee ballot and knocked out as many as they could on whatever technicality they could find or even invent
6095884 the iraqis who have risen up against the occupation are not insurgents or terrorists or the enemy they are the revolution the minutemen and their numbers will grow and they will win
6095885 osama bin laden and these non nation state fighters with religious purpose are very similar to those kinds of atypical revolutionaries that helped to cast off the british crown
6095886 half of dems nationwide agree that hillarys act of putting her name in nomination you know that heinous scheming act at the heart of hillarys plot to steal the convention for herself think it will help unify the party only 28 disagree
6095887 i believe her testimony could have changed the course of history now others believed that she would hurt anita hill
6095888 were on the brink of a financial meltdown i o u s a boldly examines the rapidly growing national debt and its consequences for the united states and its citizens
6095889 our nation suffers from a fiscal cancer that threatens the future economic well being of our country children and grandchildren
6095890 this isnt just a financial issue its a moral issue it is immoral to keep kicking this can down the road for younger generations to grapple with its time for real action rather than more rhetoric
6095891 i o u s a live with warren buffett pete peterson amp dave walker
6095892 a lot of companies are unaware of where their catalogue paper comes from
6095893 we want to work with them and pressure them to do the right thing by adopting sustainable policies
6095894 at first they werent responsive but then they saw how it would benefit them
6095895 consumer opinion has a lot of power to influence companies
6095896 we continue to work within the supply chain to promote certification of forests and fibre and we are engaged with our suppliers to continuously improve on our prudent use of natural resources
6095897 sears has yet to make any policy changes so well continue to lobby them
6095898 there is no question there is a lot more excitement in our state for sen obama than there is for sen mccain r ariz
6095899 sen obama is seen as a huge breath of fresh air
6095900 well be focusing on the continuation of the last eight years and more of the same
6095901 matt brings an impressive amount of public policy experience to the house of representatives he will provide excellent service to the people of house district 26
6095902 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
6095903 they told me there are going to be resources here
6095904 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
6095905 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
6095906 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
6095907 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
6095908 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
6095909 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
6095910 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
6095911 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
6095912 instead of focusing on positive free market solutions to energy challenges speaker of the house nancy pelosi and the democratic majority are pushing for the proven failed tax and regulatory policies of the past
6095913 and they are cheered on by global warming alarmists like al gore who want energy to be much more expensive so americans use less
6095914 educate citizens on the hot air in the energy and global warming debates
6095915 the oil and gas industry has launched a frenzied attack on these balanced common sense protections
6095916 i am here today to urge the cogcc to do what is best for all of colorado and tell an industry that routinely uses and spills dozens of toxic chemicals to stay at least 300 feet away from public drinking water sources
6095917 with tens of thousands of more wells on the way we need strong protections to ensure the oil and gas industry does not jeopardize our health and safety
6095918 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6095919 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6095920 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6095921 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6095922 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6095923 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6095924 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6095925 we are about much more than just keeping in touch we are about making people more productive in their business network
6095926 what he was saying to the rest of the world is that we need to accept both points of view
6095927 hes not judgmental about me or my belief he just disagrees with me
6095928 the same old folks that brought you george w bush
6095929 john mccain has never questioned sen obamas patriotism but he clearly does question sen obamas experience and judgment
6095930 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
6095931 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
6095932 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
6095933 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
6095934 s e n s e n again i g sensenig
6095935 take an active role to help secure a lasting settlement of the israeli palestinian conflict
6095936 its not enough for the next president to commit again to trying
6095937 to muster the political will for an intensive effort that brings the parties together hammers out their differences and brings about an agreement
6095938 since obama returned from his overseas trip it seems like mccain has thrown all the punches clearly the blows have landed in recent days obama is fighting back going after mccain on the economy the issue voters care about most mccain has changed the dynamic of the race heading into the two conventions that puts more pressure on obama to go to denver and effectively define himself and mccain
6095939 let obamas numbers drop another three or four points and well see how they feel about negative ads then
6095940 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
6095941 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
6095942 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
6095943 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
6095944 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
6095945 once again corporate decisions to put one of the worst in charge are costing chronicle readers one of the best
6095946 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
6095947 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
6095948 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
6095949 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
6095950 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
6095951 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
6095952 how could they accuse of me of doing something wrong
6095953 if im not re elected our state will lose its influence
6095954 energy questions in the united states flow from the very fact that we have an energy policy in the first place
6095955 either the swimmers got it or they dont the suit will not win the race
6095956 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
6095957 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
6095958 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
6095959 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
6095960 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
6095961 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
6095962 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
6095963 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
6095964 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
6095965 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
6095966 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
6095967 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
6095968 by hosting u s anti missile missiles poland is making itself a target this is 100 percent
6095969 it becomes a target for attack such targets are destroyed as a first priority
6095970 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
6095971 but as far as putting holes in the ground in poland we are saying no
6095972 this is being done in a friendly and straightforward way
6095973 it is also all about what we can do to reduce our carbon footprint and greenhouse gases
6095974 these are all small things and they all add up
6095975 mccain did not have a great week his visual was riding around in a golf cart with old george bush the first
6095976 shears report represents a major change in the mainstream press culture of the past sixteen years
6095977 he genuinely likes reporters hell joke with us about our drinking habits playfully request our cell phones in the middle of a call and tell some unsuspecting editor or parent that the phones owner has just been hauled off to rehab and engage in gleefully sarcastic banter about both our colleagues and his
6095978 there you go again thats exactly the politics of division that has led us to where we are in washington
6095979 the political brain the role of emotion in deciding the fate of the nation
6095980 i still dont understand how mcgovern could have lost i dont know a single person who voted for nixon
6095981 how is obama going to lose when he will get so much more votes in november than john mcbush
6095982 if anwr is so small and so filled with oil why not slant drill into it do you really think that the only oil in alaska is directly under anwr seriously
6095983 you do know that the oil companies are only drilling on a fraction of the land they currently have leases for why is that maybe because there are no more rigs to send out no more ships to transport and no more capacity at the refineries we have today have you thought of that phil
6095984 i guess since you are so well versed on oil recovery why do they lease so many acres and only find it on a miniscule percentage they have 68 million acres that have no oil on it
6095985 why do they lease so many acres and only find it on a miniscule percentage
6095986 iraq and afghanistan were supposed to instill fear in the mighty american war machine and make the terrorists think twice about attacking us instead the bush mccain war plan has made us the laughing stock of the planet and emboldened the enemy we have zero credibility we now are the torturers we are the ones with secret ussr like prisons we are the ones who refuse fair trials we are the ones who spy on our own citizens this is what obama brings to the table if its change from bush mccain failed policies thats all we need
6095987 oil drilling in anwr would not impact the u s oil supply for at least a decade
6095988 the opening of anwr would reduce the price of imported low sulfur light crude oil by only 0 75 per barrel in 2025
6095989 oh yeah there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq
6095990 im saving the word pelosi realization that democratic seats would be lost if she didnt bring off shore drilling up to a vote
6095991 you are so important to the operation of a business that your absence will cause that business to fail
6095992 a new fine art galleria of enrichment to teach and benefit the oncology children of akron childrens hospital we offer original framed art greeting cards quilts amp more at reasonable prices
6095993 you can help support and enhance the life of the oncology children at akron childrens hospital every time you shop register or order from art
6095994 the whole essay is great and while it covers what is familiar territory for mann the difference between scholarly research and
6095995 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
6095996 hey mister if you dont get those ads off the air in the next 48 hours then your military record and my military record are going to become a major issue in this campaign youve invited it and if you insist on permitting this stuff to continue then its going to be an issue
6095997 i know what im going into here for one thing im black ive got a feisty wife you know i mean we all know what theyre going to try to do here
6095998 look its just a continuation of what ive been doing a very positive approach that so far seems to have done what i hoped it would do and anyway thats the kind of guy i am so well just kind of continue
6095999 ive lost my benefits or i cant get them because my kids got a chronic heart problem or something
6096000 hey if you havent signed up as a precinct or block captain please do so the coordinators theyre ready for you give them your telephone and e mail address and so on and so forth well be in touch with you
6096001 well in the final maybe you did that in the primary dukakis but in the final its all its all this kind of stuff
6096002 get it off the air and i really mean it
6096003 i know what im walking into here i know there are some people who are going to try to take advantage of this but were going to take them on
6096004 well who is this guy anyway youre changing youre moving from here to there everywhere
6096005 hey those attacks that are coming from mccain heres the truth
6096006 look give me a summary of the kinds of things we want to say
6096007 i am married to the next president of the united states
6096008 run for governor ok what do i have to do
6096009 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
6096010 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
6096011 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
6096012 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
6096013 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
6096014 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
6096015 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
6096016 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
6096017 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
6096018 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
6096019 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
6096020 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
6096021 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
6096022 most of us in this room hold substantial arrearages of research materials that are inaccessible because they lack some level of cataloging description
6096023 a large part of deciding whether or not to hedge comes down to the way in which airlines view hedging those that see it as an insurance policy which enables them to foresee exactly what they will be paying for fuel therefore avoiding any nasty shocks are the most likely to implement long term fuel hedging strategies airlines should look at hedging as a strategic device that keeps them on an even keel and avoids extremes says leo drollas deputy executive director and chief economist at the london based centre for global energy studies but he adds that there is a tendency for airlines to hedge tactically rather than strategically meaning they are either too heavily hedged or too light on hedging so they lurch from one situation to another
6096024 one airline that follows a strategic approach to fuel hedging and has done so since 1990 is
6096025 our hedging programme is designed to shield the airline from the adverse impact of the market
6096026 our strategy is that we are not speculating if there is a low fuel price environment the aim is to mitigate the effects of changing oil prices to give lufthansa time to adjust to different levels we start 24 months out building up our hedges by 5 a month so that after 18 months up to 85 90 of demand is hedged
6096027 let me be the first to say i told you so
6096028 john doe is not the enemy we know who the enemy really is
6096029 hey todd youre a mess and need help in the next five minutes
6096030 the shame is not in getting lice the shame is in keeping them

6096033 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
6096034 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
6096035 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
6096036 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
6096037 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
6096038 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
6096039 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
6096040 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
6096041 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
6096042 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
6096043 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
6096044 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
6096045 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
6096046 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
6096047 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
6096048 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
6096049 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
6096050 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
6096051 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
6096052 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
6096053 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
6096054 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
6096055 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
6096056 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
6096057 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
6096058 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
6096059 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
6096060 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
6096061 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
6096062 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
6096063 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
6096064 you so much as breathe and im gonna fuckin end ya

6096067 senator biden forgetting about the upcoming iowa caucus for just a moment which would you honestly say is more likely to contribute to the death of your average american a terrorist strike or high fructose corn syrup and air that has too much coal in it
6096068 air that has too much coal in it corn syrup next then a terrorist attack but that is not in any way to diminish the fact that a terrorist attack is real it is not an existential threat to bringing down the country but it does have the capacity still to kill thousands of people but hundreds of thousands of people die and their lives or shortened because of coal plants coal fired plants and because of corn syrup
6096069 apparently it originally meant someone new to the game either rapping or selling crack
6096070 but that doesnt really explain how it applies to women now
6096071 and when i looked up you could see the bridge still because the lights were on but there was no bridge that night because it was all water coming at you

6096076 those have struggles of obsession survival and possession which we feel is what the show is really about
6096077 if we go to the bible a western or the transcripts of the trial for saddam hussein which we did at the end of season three we can look for cultural differences questions of race gender class conspicuous consumption and sex we like to touch on the idea of what it means to be human

6096084 we are working incredibly hard to improve the energy efficiency of our data centers
6096085 we are not physically building our servers but there is very deep engagement with the computer makers
6096086 search was a very large portion of our demand in fiscal year 2008
6096087 going into this year it is still a very large proportion it is now not as dominant as it was last year
6096088 one of the big drivers for us that i see is the move to ip based delivery of rich video
6096089 when you think about large scale data centers there are a number of limitations in the technology

6096094 the lord is with you while you are with him if you seek him he will be found by you but if you forsake him he will forsake you
6096095 listen to me asa and all judah and benjamin the lord is with you when you are with him if you seek him he will be found by you but if you forsake him he will forsake you 3 for a long time israel was without the true god without a priest to teach and without the law 4 but in their distress they turned to the lord the god of israel and sought him and he was found by them 5 in those days it was not safe to travel about for all the inhabitants of the lands were in great turmoil 6 one nation was being crushed by another and one city by another because god was troubling them with every kind of distress 7 but as for you be strong and do not give up for your work will be rewarded
6096096 i obviously know that at the end of the day that the owner has the final say so on whether or not he wants to give a guy an opportunity or not
6096097 mike has wanted to give chris this opportunity and asks that we do the best job that we can to try to prepare him and get him ready to play football
6096098 the bengals tried for an extended period of time to support chris and his potentially bright career we had hoped to guide him toward an appropriate standard of personal responsibility that this community would support and that would allow him to play in the nfl but those efforts end today as we move on with what is best for our team
6096099 i guess the world is divided up between redeemers and non redeemers
6096100 i happen to be a redeemer i think people can be made better and right if thats a fault so be it
6096101 my agents spoke with other teams but as far as signing there was none of them
6096102 to have that taken away from you that can be really hard
6096103 that would have been a tough thing to go through i kind of went through that i was scared at one point that i wouldnt have the opportunity to be back on the field
6096104 i think the last three or four months have been very humbling for chris
6096105 the week since the charges were dropped and his phone didnt ring i think that was also humbling

6096123 its naive when people think that youre going to have a couple of politicians get together and solve the conflict in the middle east
6096124 its more than naive theres a level of arrogance there
6096125 my belief does not influence my views on foreign policy but at the same time it has clearly given me perspective on the depth of the history of the middle east if youve studied the bible you certainly understand this conflict didnt start in the 1940s it started with isaac and ishmael

6096158 sabes creo que lo har cuando crea que tengo que hacerlo
6096159 what the hell am i doing writing about relationships and love as a single twice divorced man
6096160 primary goal of marriage is partners get precisely what they want
6096161 my marriage relationship problems are caused by others not by me or my spouse
6096162 a marriage shouldnt be hard a relationship should not take this much work and effort
6096163 refers to a persons belief about what causes the good or bad results in their life either in general or in a specific area it can either be internal meaning the person believes that they control themselves and their life or external meaning they believe that their environment some higher power or other people control their decisions and their life
6096164 i will never be attracted to anyone ever again once i tie the knot
6096165 keep up with the jones with the nice car and big house etc
6096166 the high divorce rate separates out unhappy marriages so people who stay married have better marriages than people did in the past when everyone stuck with it no matter how horrible their marriage was
6096167 pursuing your own needs individuality is incompatible with making a marriage work
6096168 my spouse should know my wants and needs without me saying anything
6096169 the key is commitment to god romantic love is irrelevant to a lasting marriage
6096170 you always forget everything you are just not romantic anymore how do you expect us to make this marriage work
6096171 but honey according to romans 7 2 3 if i am committed to god my level of romance is irrelevant to our marriage being long lasting and successful
6096172 inspector general of the marine corps review of body composition programs indicates we still have marines that fail to meet body composition standards

6096184 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
6096185 is this short term trend an indication that more sellers are looking to
6096186 perhaps but part of the increase in new listings may be explained by the many price changes we are seeing in torontos real estate market when a realtor wants to change the price for their listing at 123 main street for example they can either update the listing for that home with the new price or they can take 123 main street off of the market and then upload a new listing for 123 main street at the new price the advantage of the later approach is it resets the days on market for the house back to 0 making the listing look newer than it really is one of the problems with this is that both listings would be counted as new listings because they would have different mls numbers
6096187 its not uncommon to see the same house listed up to 4 separate times by the same agent in this case trebs data would show 4 new listings when there should have been just 1
6096188 the advantage of the incomprehensible is that it never loses its freshness
6096189 for many years i was a self appointed inspector of snowstorms and rainstorms and did my duty faithfully though i never received payment for it
6096190 the bondage to books compels us not to see with our own eyes compels us to see with the eyes of the dead with dead eyes there is a hex on us the authority of the past and to exorcise these ghosts is the great work of magical self liberation
6096191 it is the dead who govern look how they work their will upon us who have made the laws the dead who have made the customs that we obey and that form and shape our lives the dead all the writers when they would give weight and authority to their opinions quote the dead our lives follow grooves that the dead have run out with their thumbnails

6096216 i have no control i have to comply with anything they choose to do and i have no voice in the matter
6096217 id be giving up a months income to get that done thats the only thing thats keeping me on ebay the inconvenience of leaving
6096218 i talk to other people who have done what i did and theyre happy with their decision theyve been able to get their business to the ebay business levels or beyond
6096219 many times you feel like theyre really pushing it to see if youll give them some kind of a refund
6096220 theyll float the suggestion that this isnt exactly what i expected
6096221 when ebay makes these dramatic changes it can make you very nervous
6096222 but again ebay is doing what ebay believes it has to do to protect its marketplace
6096223 to look down the coast and not see anything its amazing
6096224 theyll say its the most spectacular place on earth dont tell anybody

6096262 i have enjoyed my time at penyrheol studying for gcses although the pressure at some points was very high
6096263 i have also enjoyed the role of chairing the school council alongside fran roberts head girl of penyrheol comprehensive
6096264 the role of head boy developed not only my practical skills such as organisational public speaking and leadership skills but also allowed me to develop my personal skills as i am required to deal with personal issues in confidence
6096265 luckily this role combined with my academic studies easily allowing my education to remain unaffected
6096266 i studied 10 subjects english english literature mathematics double award science history welsh drama music and short course ict
6096267 my favourite subjects in school are maths and music i play several musical instruments including the piano the double bass and the bass guitar
6096268 i hope to continue my studies at gorseinon college next year hopefully studying pure mathematics physics music and music technology
6096269 i am looking forward to being able to concentrate on my favourite subjects those which someday i hope to have a career in

6096274 i was very nervous about my exams beforehand however in hindsight i believe i have done my best and there is little more that i could have done in preparation
6096275 i just hope that all my hard work will pay off and as a result my grades will reflect the work i have put in

6096277 the company intends to roll out a new editorial system whilst shedding a large number of staff its inevitable that those who remain will be expected to carry a greater burden of work and that has implications for the lives of everyone working on the papers not to mention the long term future of quality journalism at the titles

6096314 very often these are the jobs where people are living very close to the bone
6096315 workers are sometimes putting their jobs on the line because they have a sick child or are sick

6096317 theres been some concern that employees are abusing the ordinance theres been a little bit of that but not as widespread as people thought at the beginning
6096318 after five months our assessment shows that the sentiment is still there not that were over confident but thats the information we get on the ground
6096319 it seems that their mind is focused on the permatang pauh umno division campaign they are giving the impression that this by election is a gone case and they would rather prepare for their own party polls
6096320 im worried that if this trend continues it will reflect badly again on umno and bn when i watch the tv news our leaders are all out campaigning against anwar but on the ground theres not much being done
6096321 if we lose badly again people will get more fed up with us
6096322 im confident that the voters in permatang pauh are smart enough to differentiate between propaganda and the truth we know that bn is desperate not just about anwar winning this by election but what will happen on sept 16
6096323 what bn is doing is to derail anwars plan although the march 8 results have indicated that the people wanted change

6096327 the polyketal microparticles we developed are simply a vehicle to get the drugs inside the body to the diseased area as quickly as possible
6096328 the major advantage to using these polyketals to deliver drugs is that they degrade into biocompatible compounds that dont accumulate in a patients tissue or cause additional inflammation
6096329 we think these microparticles are going to be fantastic for oral drug delivery because they can survive the stomach conditions before they release their contents in the intestines
6096330 patients with acute liver failure need drugs as soon as possible or else theyll die
6096331 weve tailored the polyketals hydrolysis rates to deliver the drug in one or two days
6096332 delivering proteins inside microparticles has been limited because getting the protein into the microparticles required organic solvents that frequently destroyed the proteins

6096355 besides me being really vigilant about it the mri is the number one reason that im going to live if this had been caught a year from now or when i was 40 i probably wouldnt be able to live through this or i would have to undergo such much more than i have
6096356 its incredibly expensive so for me one of the things when this all happened was that im putting together a program to pay for mris for women who are at high risk which means women who have had it in their family or know that theyre gene positive
6096357 were also going to pay for the genetic testing because thats very very expensive its upwards of 2 000 to 3 000 so all of that is coming together right now

6096367 in addition to supporting multiple active controllers clustered systems virtualise the individual controllers and make the entire set of controllers appear as one single storage system to hosts
6096368 i believe the architecture has these features but ibm didnt feel comfortable presenting them to the market yet
6096369 weird nothing from ibm other than the announcement letters posted to ibm com world wide not even a press release no customer stories
6096370 maybe this whole xiv thing wasnt really all that big a deal after all
6096371 theyve taken a very conservative step in presenting this product to the market
6096372 on the contrary i think its because ibm is ibm and they like to do things in a conservative fashion

6096380 when i was in the hospital recovering from five gunshot wounds i was around people who were shot in the same places as me but who couldnt walk or who lost their limbs as a result of what happened

6096392 i feel that we may be stuck in the 1970s things have changed and there is no future in comparing what we are doing now to how athletes like john treacy and others performed back then we need to be supported and appreciated for what we are trying to achieve right now
6096393 athletics ireland is trying hard and the training camp in japan was really excellent
6096394 i found my experience here in beijing to be far more positive than negative
6096395 i did run out of steam in the final eighty meters of my qualifying heat but the whole experience here has given me a great reason to look towards london in four years time even thought i was at one stage this summer considering my future in the sport
6096396 i think that athletics ireland are doing a good job and really trying to make things better for all of us
6096397 i think that the athletes need to work more together and i would be open to any suggestions in this regard
6096398 i may have made a mistake to base myself in spain this summer and i would much prefer to be able to train at home and to have someone to train with

6096402 this new knowledge suggests the possibility of interventions which could prove to be powerful ways to prevent or delay age related macular degeneration

6096409 very often these are the jobs where people are living very close to the bone
6096410 workers are sometimes putting their jobs on the line because they have a sick child or are sick
6096411 if we live in a society where all adults are working then we need to have a workplace to accommodate that reality

6096423 well only play eight teams who are of a similar level to us
6096424 in a previous era art was a realm beyond commodification in which a certain freedom was still available in late modernism in adorno and horkheimers culture industry essay there were still zones of art exempt from the commodifications of commercial culture for them essentially hollywood surely what characterizes postmodernity in the cultural area is the supersession of everything outside of commercial culture its absorption of all forms of art high and low along with image production itself the image is the commodity today and that is why it is vain to expect a negation of the logic of commodity production from it that is why finally all beauty today is meretricious and the appeal to it by contemporary pseudo aestheticism is an ideological manoeuvre and not a creative resource

6096444 hes on his own now he makes all the decisions outside the pool and i take care of the pool
6096445 in athens he had never had any personal freedom at all now hes had a lot and hes screwed it up and hes learned what that means hes done a pretty good job with it i had my doubts in the beginning that we were going to get there but now i think hes got it down
6096446 it sounds really cliched but its true hes really grown as a human being
6096447 that in itself is going to serve him well as he makes these decisions in the upcoming few months and few years
6096448 i think hell just want to be a celebrity whatever that means hell just have to keep improving if he wants to do that he handles himself so much better than he did i was just amazed at some of the answers he gave to a lot of these questions this time

6096467 if given the opportunity steve will definitely be the candidate who holds true to the values of women and minorities and who works to uphold civil rights and liberties each and every day his ideology experience and candor all speak for themselves when it comes to these issues

6096484 my decision after looking at all the treatment plans that were possibilities for me the only one that seemed the most logical and the one that was going to work for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy
6096485 so basically i had prophylactic double mastectomies people would say three weeks ago
6096486 i didnt want to go back to the doctors every four months for testing and squishing and everything i just wanted to kind of be rid of this whole thing for me and so this was the choice that i made and it was a tough one
6096487 i absolutely adore him and ill do whatever is necessary to help him become the next president im so excited that he is running

6096500 id say this is the most fundamental change weve made ever to the marketplace
6096501 consumers are voting with their wallets and saying auctions arent really the way i want to buy cosmetics or something like that
6096502 very opportunistic but also in line with what their customers are telling them they want
6096503 this will be viewed as ebay continues to push paypal down everyones throat
6096504 when we entered formula 1 in 1997 all of the circuits were new to us with f1 cars so it is fitting that we should celebrate our 200th race with a new track
6096505 valencia is a city we spend a lot of time in when we are testing at the permanent race circuit so to be able to race along the streets of the port will be particularly special for us
6096506 for bridgestone we have evaluated the track layout and surface and we will bring the softest tyres in our compound range the soft and super soft
6096507 as with any street course we expect the grip levels from the circuit to improve over the course of the weekend
6096508 our system will allow jamaal to continue to play his style of basketball
6096509 i am extremely pleased to see that figures for university acceptances in england are at an all time high up by 6 on this time last year
6096510 i am particularly encouraged by the increase in acceptances from lower socio economic groups as we continue to work to widen participation in higher education through for example greater links between universities and schools and the aimhigher programme
6096511 clearing is not just for those who miss their predicted grades but those who havent considered higher education now have the option to change their minds and apply
6096512 like a jewels brilliance is displayed on a black cloth jesus love is displayed against the blackness of sin and the filth of the flesh
6096513 but with the precious blood of christ as a lamb without blemish and without spot
6096514 ive walked past b before and it looks like a really fun place to have dinner and drinks
6096515 i thought that by satisfying my flesh i could escape from my head
6096516 i know that i believed in the lord and loved him but i guess the easiest thing to say is that i didnt understand grace
6096517 do i remember what they were talking about at the time nope
6096518 but i may not have chosen him until that time
6096519 the levels of disengagement among twentysomethings suggest that youth ministry fails
6096520 i know many christians who have not left the faith but left their former church experience in search of something deeper
6096521 they were in search of deeper relationships deeper service to the community and the world or a deeper sense of wonder
6096522 perhaps in the name of unity we have created a legalistic standard which is a subpar spiritual experience
6096523 they judged people so harshly for what they did i didnt want that
6096524 we have to question examine and reclaim the values and beliefs that we have formed to that point in our lives
6096525 i attended a christian college so i was attending chapel three times a week and taking bible classes i exerted all the will power i could muster but it didnt work no matter how hard i tried i was left feeling empty confused distant and not very available to love others well i used god to keep emotional pain at bay
6096526 when your spirituality doesnt promote an experience of connection with god when it is being co opted for some other natural and understandable that you drift away
6096527 we often find a new love a new purpose to fuel our lives a job or career a hobby or a relationship perhaps a marriage if our spirituality didnt work then we naturally find something to fill that void
6096528 drift from god is a normal and understandable result of this stage of life we need to better understand the demands of these transitions
6096529 the psychologist that is seeking to help you with your interpersonal problems often deals only with symptoms the heart of the problem lies in your relationship with god
6096530 they make you feel good when you walk out pastors know that to bring people into church they have to appeal to the broadest masses and the way to do that is to keep things as simple and optimistic as possible
6096531 if natural curiosity doesnt push young people away from organized religion the churches will often end up doing it themselves
6096532 is to help them return to full productive lives through work
6096533 we were pretty ticked off to say the least the reason he got paddled was because he was untying his shoes and playing with the air conditioner thermostat
6096534 one of the things weve seen over and over again is that parents have difficulty getting redress if a child is paddled and severely injured or paddled in violation of parents wishes
6096535 international human rights law puts a pretty strong prohibition on corporal punishment
6096536 hes going on an official visit there oklahoma hes going to visit there xavier offered hell visit there boston college i dont think has offered yet but he could use one of the five officials there pittsburgh offered theyve been in the picture for a while texas a amp m offered a scholarship in the summer time and all these schools im not saying they called him a couple times the head coaches really sat down and offered him scholarships full rides im so proud of that kid he came so far and he just wants to play against big kids night in and night out

6096540 an informed and dispassionate public debate over the effects of the 21 year old drinking age
6096541 and that is the most common place they get seriously ill
6096542 its time we look at the issue afresh and see whether there are better solutions than we currently have in place because after all we havent solved the problem
6096543 there are many many first time drinkers in the first few months of college
6096544 what we have done is be very honest about this as an institution and trained staff to deal with it
6096545 now students start to experiment when they are no longer under their parents supervision
6096546 and that encourages them to drink in ways that are less safe for them
6096547 it might make the drinking more visible but i dont know if it would make it easier to monitor and control
6096548 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words

6096582 my preliminary conclusion is youve got a guy with too much time on his hands and is nosy and was showing people that he had access to all this kind of information and doing favors for friends and looking things up over a period of time
6096583 if it goes beyond that itll be a very serious matter and well handle it appropriately
6096584 it is obvious that this cannot be investigated on the state level by state officials due to individuals conflicts of interest
6096585 this is a serious matter as it appears laws have been broken someone must be held accountable

6096613 many pensions belong to working class people without other savings who will be counting pennies in their retirement for these people keeping up with the price of eggs is very important and investing in equities over the past decade has turned out to be a pretty gruesome decision im not sure if its possible for a pension fund to benchmark a food basket but there are lots of fund managers out there who are responsible for the life savings and wellbeing of people who are going to spend their retirements living on low incomes such managers might well want to start spending less time looking at absolute returns and more time keeping an eye on the cost of living and how it might be hedged
6096614 i dont know where the carr story has come from i can categorically say no to that one i keep hearing the brown rumour but theres nothing in it in fact i dont see us doing anything before the transfer window shuts we need a good squad and ive only got three central midfield players
6096615 michael probably wont be fit and mark viduka certainly wont be

6096618 u s stocks with a good representation of smaller growth companies
6096619 for most people i recommend broad based total stock market index funds rather than individual stocks for portfolio formation

6096621 u s stocks with a good representation of smaller growth companies
6096622 a random walk is one in which future steps or directions cannot be predicted on the basis of past actions

6096626 all too many investors are lazy and careless a terrifying combination when greed gets control of the market and everyone wants to cash in on the latest craze or fad
6096627 it is not really hard to make money in the market
6096628 with index funds you know exactly what you are getting and the investment process is made incredibly simple
6096629 the most important decision you will probably ever make concerns the balancing of asset categories stocks bonds real estate money market securities etc at different stages of your life
6096630 according to roger ibbotson more than 90 of an investors total return is determined by the asset categories that are selected and their overall proportional representation
6096631 in the 1990s the ratio of buy to sell recommendations climbed to 100 to 1 particularly by brokerage firms with large investment banking businesses
6096632 stock investors can do no better than simply buying and holding a fund that owns a representative sample of all the stocks in the market
6096633 i am convinced that no one will be successful in using technical methods to get above average returns in the stock market
6096634 simply buying and holding a diversified portfolio suited to your objectives will enable you to save on investment expense brokerage charges and taxes
6096635 every investor must decide the trade off he or she is willing to make between eating well and sleeping well
6096636 again and again yesterdays star fund has proven to be todays disaster

6096643 there is never going to be a handsome genie who will appear and solve all our investment problems
6096644 buying and holding a broad based market index fund is still the only game in town
6096645 any truly repetitive and exploitable pattern that can be discovered in the stock market and can be arbitraged away will self destruct
6096646 given enough time and massaging of data series it is possible to tease almost any pattern out of most data sets
6096647 clearly buying a portfolio of small firms is hardly a surefire technique to enable an investor to earn abnormally high risk adjusted returns
6096648 over a period running back to the 1930s it does not appear that investors could actually have realized higher rates of return from mutual funds specializing in value stocks
6096649 i am convinced that many studies have been flawed by the phenomenon of survivorship bias
6096650 the more profitable any return predictability appears to be the less likely it is to survive
6096651 i have yet to see any compelling evidence that past stock prices can be used to predict future stock prices
6096652 never buy anything from someone who is out of breath
6096653 the decision of which ira is best for you and whether to convert can be a tough call
6096654 for investors who are very risk averse i favor gnma funds
6096655 own your own home if you can possibly afford it
6096656 if your expected investment period is only for a decade or less no one can predict the returns you will receive with any degree of accuracy
6096657 there aint no such thing as a free lunch higher risk is the price one pays for more generous returns
6096658 switching your investment around in a futile attempt to time the market will only involve extra commissions for your broker extra taxes for the government and poorer net performance
6096659 dollar cost averaging can reduce the risks of investing in stocks and bonds
6096660 dont think that dollar cost averaging will solve all of your problems
6096661 what goes down must come back up but this does not necessarily hold for individual stocks just for the market in general
6096662 the key to whether any recommended asset allocation works for you is whether you are able to sleep at night
6096663 for most people i recommend broad based total stock market index funds rather than individual stocks for portfolio formation
6096664 i have become increasingly convinced that the past records of mutual fund managers are essentially worthless in predicting future success
6096665 luck may be 99 percent responsible for the success of the very few people who have beaten the averages
6096666 the mutual fund industry has developed a system of charging expenses to investors that is as complicated as irs income tax regulations and equally unpleasant
6096667 i have often said that the two best things that have happened to the mutual fund industry are the arrival of jack bogle of vanguard and don phillips of morningstar

6096678 the most serious blunder that this sitting regime could commit
6096679 president musharrafs resignation is a welcome change in pakistan and everybody is happy about it now the country is less uncertain because president musharrafs resignation is a step forward and the countrys overall situation can improve
6096680 now a political discussion will be possible sacked judges will be restored and the coalition government will be able to better tackle the countrys problems
6096681 but the government will bear greater responsibilities since it now has all the power
6096682 a meeting like this with is an insult to the intelligence of every human being it is a na ve political trick
6096683 they told her to convert to islam or die she refused and started praying out loud but they did not kill her not straight away they raped her and then she was shot in the head
6096684 later two of my sisters were widowed by car bombs
6096685 the profile matched in the test and the dna report turned out positive which apparently shows that the girl was raped or sexually assaulted
6096686 might have had a love affair with someone in the village
6096687 some relatives of the rapists told me to compromise with them by withdrawing the case
6096688 they told me that if i do not compromise with them they will evict us from the village and our life will be in great danger
6096689 the police told us the dna report is positive and it is the acknowledgement of the rape case
6096690 sperm of the of the arrested person has been found on elinas clothing according to the dna report
6096691 we are investigating the case whether she was raped and if not then how is it that the sperm is found on elinas clothing
6096692 police assured me that the charge sheet against the rapists will be submitted to the court soon and that they do not need any further evidence because the dna report has everything they need
6096693 the criminals are far too aged none of them so far identified is her classmate or in the same age range
6096694 what happened to her is inhumane and i do not find any reason why such a minor girl would be raped an outburst of religious anger because of their different christian faith could be the cause of this inhuman activity
6096695 there is communal harmony and there has been no communal incident in the district at all
6096696 one the school where fr pandipally was working is doing very well and it also has a dispute with another school
6096697 second fr pandipally had expelled the driver of a school bus over some dispute on his salary
6096698 the crowd also indulged in vandalism and demolished a statue of mother mary
6096699 the police had to lock up the building and take the keys with them to pacify the crowd
6096700 later the fcc sisters filed a suit in the court of law against the protestors
6096701 and the sisters started receiving threats on phone that if they did not withdraw the case some members of their communities would be attacked
6096702 a huge crowd led by rss supporters gathered around the school and tried to parade the then principal naked under flimsy pretexts but the police protected him
6096703 why should anyone kill him so brutally i cant understand
6096704 his head was hit with sticks and boulders and the skull was split open
6096705 all over his face on his eyes lips and cheeks deep wounds were found his motorcycle was thrown in bushes about four kilometers away he was done to death in the forest and his body was brought back and thrown in the middle of the road
6096706 the indian church is shocked and deeply saddened by this barbarous killing which is the result of a growing climate of intolerance and violence against christians in the country
6096707 i am not against christianity but raju and daniel converted hundreds of hindu families
6096708 they enticed them with money we have done this to prevent further conversions this act should be a lesson for others
6096709 christians were not immune from persecution and raw treatment during the tenure of presidents that preceded musharraf but the scale of christian persecution was worst during musharrafs rule
6096710 no amendment has been made in minorities personal laws including marriage act divorce act and inheritance act during former the presidents rule
6096711 a person shall not be qualified for election as president unless he is a muslim of not less than forty five years of age and is qualified to be elected as member of the national assembly
6096712 they the minority councilors neither have power nor any funds
6096713 they are at the mercy of their respective nazims mayors
6096714 reserved seats for minorities have not increased since the creation of pakistan and musharrafs rule was no exception
6096715 musharraf introduced the joint electorate system for minorities after knuckling under international pressure
6096716 whoever becomes next president he is likely to remain indifferent toward pakistani christians
6096717 he had thrown his lot with the u s president george w bush in the wake of 9 11 terrorist attacks in usa
6096718 musharrafs role in war on terror did not improve minorities situation
6096719 he had lost popularity with masses there was a general opinion in the country that he should go
6096720 every pakistani irrespective of his faith should be entitled to run in the presidential elections this issue is not religious but that of equality for all
6096721 the political parties leadership has become mature over the years i hope they can agree on a consensus candidate
6096722 it is in the spirit of democracy that the next president comes from the ppp
6096723 this is a case where initiating the legislation gives rise to the destruction of an institution
6096724 these considerations should be placed before parliament presently there are hearings which are hearing these issues
6096725 and presently we are sitting as the court looking at these issues that just cant be right that just cant be right
6096726 i am not sure that is the cataclysmic kind of effect that requires interfering with parliament

6096761 we have sold our clothing to a trade show and sold wholesale to other stores across the country from california florida and up to maine
6096762 we recently have the opportunity to open our retail shop to service our local customers in the south shore and boston and cambridge
6096763 i love having our retail store i love that we get to talk to the customers and see what they need
6096764 we plan to open more retail shops in the berkshire and the cape
6096765 i discovered their line in other shops in hanover but they dont carry it consistently so im happy to find that they open a retail store i first stopped by here in last march
6096766 i dealt with warren the other half of the business and he was fabulous he made a personal appointment with me and has taken a very good care of me they tailor the cloth to fit me perfectly i mean how can you find someone who does that these days
6096767 then when we got everything ready to get back in business again but all the trade shows were canceled after 9 11
6096768 when 9 11 happened i had absolutely no idea what to do with myself so i decided to make the most complicated dress i could ever do thats when i first designed the flag dress
6096769 its started as a self therapy for me i have been sewing since i was in third grade its my passion
6096770 from 9 11 we realized how deeply we felt about this great country this renewed our desire to have all our designs made in the u s a

6096778 one of the reasons why the education given by our schools is so frothy and vapid is that the american people generally the parent even more than the teacher wish childhood to be unspoiled by pain childhood must be a period of delight of gay indulgence in impulses it must be given every avenue for unimpeded expression which of course is pleasant and it must not be made to suffer the impositions of discipline or the exactions of duty which of course are painful childhood must be filled with as much play and as little work as possible what cannot be accomplished educationally through elaborate schemes devised to make learning an exciting game must of necessity be forgone heaven forbid that learning should ever take on the character of a serious occupation just as serious as earning money and perhaps much more laborious and painful
6096779 the trouble also lies in the fact that agencies of adult education baby the public even more than the schools coddle the children they have turned the whole nation so far as education is concerned into a kindergarten it must all be fun it must all be entertaining adult learning must be made as effortless as possible painless devoid of oppressive burdens and of irksome tasks
6096780 we try to make adult education as exciting as a football game as relaxing as a motion picture and as easy on the mind as a quiz program otherwise we will not be able to draw the big crowds and the important thing is to draw large numbers of people into this educational game even if after we get them there we leave them untransformed
6096781 not only must we honestly announce that pain and work are the irremovable and irreducible accompaniments of genuine learning not only must we leave entertainment to the entertainers and make education a task and not a game but we must have no fears about what is
6096782 if standardization of the nutrition practice is left in the hands of a single professional organization the potential bias caused by financial arrangements raises important questions it is a dangerous mistake to establish in law a monopoly on nutritional counseling

6097095 this is product extension at its best where the new products ipod and iphone are helping bring new customers to existing computer products
6097096 my first computer purchased by my parents after nearly a year of begging was an apple ii that was 1982 i was a windows user for the next 20 years but went back to mac when they switched to intel chips a couple of years ago since then ive bought seven macs for myself as well as at least one of every ipod and both iphones a lot of these were test devices that ive passed on to friends and family
6097097 my obvious enthusiasm for apple products is fairly evident to readers of this blog but recently ive had a string of bad apples come my way so to speak its time for apple to stop screwing around and start paying attention to product quality

6097121 rock band 2 yesterday im speculating without any insider info but it seems that this same system could work on the ps3 but not necessarily on the hard drive free wii
6097122 rb2 owners who rented a copy of the game would be able to perform this transfer as long as they pay the fee drake noted they probably could
6097123 we did i think a good job with the wii last year but were doing a great job this year because this is where the casual audience is the mass audience is here its a great control system but youve got to learn to use it
6097124 i think the biggest learning we had this year is that you port your controls up as opposed to down
6097125 we lived where somehow l2 means hit someone on the head
6097126 that makes zero sense to a casual player but if i asked how do you do it on the wii performs a simple motion gesture that makes sense
6097127 im really proud of how it looks it does not look like a wii game to me
6097128 theres no excuse to not having the wii version looking great
6097129 this is a stand alone model and not simply a wagon version of the sedan in fact all the bodywork aft of the b pillar is unique to the sports tourer weve also ensured that its design combines the sculptural artistry and technical precision found in the notch and hatchback models

6097152 they shouldt change they should make another iowa im sure the next album will sound like the old ones
6097153 every album we have made is a statement about that space in time i think this era is the most mature most beautiful and the most powerful we have made an album that will show the road behind the road ahead and where we are as men i think its the best thing ive ever made and i challenge anyone to prove me wrong
6097154 what i want to know is can you watch something that can change you
6097155 for the last three years i vowed to get to the center of what i know im a part of which is one of the greatest bands in the world today
6097156 my intent was to make you sick to your stomach
6097157 it was said to me very early in my career that rock n roll is 23 hours of hell and one hour of god
6097158 thats what i want you to hear because thats what hes going through
6097159 the band is 10 years old and i felt that we needed to talk for real
6097160 were going into our places of choice individually and youre being invited all the way in hopefully youll be able to stomach what is real
6097161 im not worried about going anywhere because were only getting better
6097162 we constantly remind all of you that we dont push the envelope because we are the envelope
6097163 every album we have made is a statement about that space in time i think this era is the most mature most beautiful and the most powerful we have made an album that will show the road behind the road ahead and where we are as men i think its the best thing ive ever made and i challenge anyone to prove me wrong
6097164 i cant imagine that its possible for someone to do better within the program we have
6097165 if they want to add a couple of days then maybe but that was a very special accomplishment and were not looking to replicate it
6097166 were just going to try and move forward and set some other goals i think this is a high watermark in terms of the total number of medals
6097167 i think it will only help his 200 to have a faster 100 so that fits in well with what were trying to do it but theres no chance of going up
6097168 i think that he has goals to work towards and things that are exciting to us and that will mean doing something thats new
6097169 i thought about phelpsy for the australians but probably not
6097170 i just think thats a lot of pressure to put on a horse
6097171 he was so fast he had to swim with older swimmers and because i was a new coach and i wanted to impress them and think i was tough i gave them an extremely difficult training program
6097172 because michael was the youngest he would go to the back of the line but by the end of the practice and at the most difficult part of the training session i saw a little cap moving up forward to the front of the line with each repeat swim
6097173 it was so remarkable id never seen anything like it and when i went home that night i couldnt sleep i was so excited but of course i didnt tell him that
6097174 when i disciplined him and tried to get him to stop playing around i said you should be very tired thats the hardest practice youve ever done
6097175 ill never forget he looked me straight in the eye and said i dont get tired so i made that my life goal to see if i could accomplish that
6097176 he was just 11 but six months later he swam those exact times to the one hundredth of a second
6097177 he always had a very good sense of finding where he wants to go and how to go there
6097178 i saw them sitting in our team area i could have taken the goggles to him but i decided to keep them and see what he could do
6097179 so he swam and won the race without the goggles just like he did here in the 200 butterfly when his goggles filled with water
6097180 ive always tried to find ways to give him adversity in either meets or practice and have him overcome it

6097187 because its a public health and an environmental bill its of even more concern
6097188 a major shot across the bow from beijing to burlington
6097189 this is about china but its also about to what degree do these international agreements intrude on normal state lawmaking powers
6097190 we gave up some sovereignty when we joined the wto no one disputes that but what exactly did we give up
6097191 we cant say in hindsight that they should have done more
6097192 they do the best they can under the circumstances i think this case worker worked off the best information available
6097193 its naive to think that we can solve the problem of sexual violence by banishing sex criminals from our communities
6097194 they have to live somewhere theyre going to live somewhere and i think that collectively as a society we have a responsibility to deal with this social problem in a way that is most likely to achieve our goal of improving public safety
6097195 would seemingly be one of the best strategies to deal with this issue

6097216 you watch michael phelps kick butt in the swimming pool you watch our mens basketball team dominate i would hope the ioc wants the olympics to be about giving everything that you possibly have and if you happen to win by a lot thats what makes the game so beautiful
6097217 i had so much emotion so much want to go out on top
6097218 if that is the reason who wants to play in a sport where winning is bad

6097231 obama believes that upon being elected president of the united states he could sign an executive order that would overturn the bush position on stem cell research and open up the avenues considerably
6097232 hope is that we may reach the day when we no longer need to use embryonic stem cells as the foundation of this particular line of research where we can move to the more recent advances and take away the tough decisions about life versus science
6097233 regardless of the parties there is a certain political intercourse that is thrown in with other broader benefits of future access and gratitude when you become a financier of the conventions
6097234 while we recognize that the steps we have taken are not perfect or even a perfect symbol they do reflect the fact that barack obama shares the urgent desire of the american people to change the way washington operates
6097235 the idea is to give our leadership a chance to be with these folks to talk about our issues and make sure that our issues are out there

6097239 what obama is creating is this army of individuals these grass roots activists who are out there trying to change the world in 160 characters or less
6097240 if were successful there will be language in that plank or elsewhere that mccain wants to take a different track in dealing with abortion
6097241 in a close election pro life voters make the difference
6097242 if john mccain is to win in november he must keep faith with the pro life and pro family base of the party
6097243 expects to do it again this year despite ms stones press releases
6097244 as a country we must keep our pledge to the first guarantee of the declaration of independence that is why we say the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed
6097245 the entrenched political and cultural norms that perpetuate male dominated decision making bodies and constrain women
6097246 transitioning government structures which afford particular opportunity for repositioning womens role in public life and decision making
6097247 a lot of laws have not been interpreted or defined in a new country and you can assume that whatever you want the law to be it is unless it is proven otherwise so of course we put the most progressive spin on it
6097248 the more we say it the more people get to believing it were changing the norm first they laugh and then they start repeating it
6097249 it would be very difficult to pull this information together
6097250 brendas last published study using this data set was released in 2000 after she moved to her present facility in 1995
6097251 immediately after that publication one of my colleagues requested a break down of details which had only been superficially summarized in one her tables one of her grad students replied on her behalf with the additional summary statistics we had requested within 48 hours so it clearly wasnt at all difficult for her team to access the data plus with modern electronic data bases and multiple backup procedures in place at universities like hers it is nearly impossible to lose such data
6097252 i know of a number of experts in the field who have requested the data even within the last six months but she simply doesnt respond to their calls emails or letters
6097253 this is very troubling on two counts first it the apas own ethics rule 8 14 requires research psychologists to share their data for verification of findings secondly she is the chair of the apa abortion task force which is at least in theory supposed to bring full and clear light to this issue but how can we trust the objectivity of a report prepared by a task force composed exclusively of pro choice psychologists especially when the chair and lead author has a history of withholding data and findings which may undermine her ideological preferences
6097254 there is no doubt that she has selectively reported her findings
6097255 we have seen in the unpublished tables details about specific negative reactions which were obscured in her published report by combining them with three to eight other reactions to create watered down composite scores
6097256 in my view it is irresponsible not to report the significant findings associated with individual symptoms for example she found that a number of women reported that they tried to cope with negative feelings about their abortions by drinking more or taking drugs but she has never not fully shared the details on these reactions in any of her published studies and by refusing to share her data for reanalysis by others she has prevented anyone else from reporting these findings either
6097257 there is no credible evidence that a single elective abortion of an unwanted pregnancy in and of itself causes mental health problems for adult women
6097258 even the modifier that there is no credible evidence of mental health risks in the ideal case of a low risk abortion patient is an admission that there is indeed some evidence that a single abortion can pose a risk to the mental health of a emotionally stable adult woman
6097259 in fact the report itself identifies a whole host of studies providing such evidence but it mutes a clear presentation of the findings of these studies by focusing on the limitations of each studys methodology which all studies have in order to justify ignoring their clear implications
6097260 by failing to call on therapists to be alert and sensitive to the negative emotional experiences women attribute to their abortions the task force has allowed ideology to trump sensitivity
6097261 instead they are ignoring the reality of how and why abortions take place and are instead focused on drawing conclusions regarding the safety of abortion for an emotionally stable pro choice adult woman who is freely choosing a wanted abortion without any moral qualms but that doesnt reflect the reality of most abortion situations
6097262 the fact is that coerced abortions are more common than wanted abortions
6097263 studies show that over 60 of american women are having abortions often against their moral beliefs because they feel pressured into it by third parties these women need therapist and family members to be open to and responsive to their pain not dismissive of it as an anomaly
6097264 you contain your infrastructure but you also contain the heat thats generated from the servers
6097265 we are working incredibly hard to improve the energy efficiency of our data centers

6097267 search was a very large portion of our demand in fiscal year 2008

6097272 perhaps companies will want to put windfarms atop our bridges and skyscrapers or use the enormous potential of powerful off shore winds miles out in the atlantic ocean where turbines could generate roughly twice the energy that land based windfarms can
6097273 we want their best ideas for creating both small and large scale projects serving new yorkers
6097274 if rooftop wind can make it anywhere this is a great city
6097275 in the coming quarters we have a unique opportunity to advance our strategy and take on the most important competitors in the market this is where we can and must move the mark
6097276 india remains poised to grow at a near double digit rate for several years now even if the growth is punctuated from time to time by brief pauses
6097277 in 2007 we re established stock brokerage operations and local investment banking coverage in 2008 we established a wealth management business
6097278 when we look at markets in india the growth prospects over the near medium and longer terms are excellent and there are going to be great opportunities as a result with regard to the opportunities that we see in india our global capabilities match very well with the business here
6097279 the diversity of our activities in pune underscores the strength and diversity of talent that has made india such a center of new industry and innovation
6097280 global institutions that have already made the investment in a flexible scaleable operating platform and have the ability to tap high quality talent to serve local regional and global needs will be those that succeed
6097281 india is facing some significant challenges in terms of inflation and oil prices but while there will be some slowdown in growth we dont see it as anywhere near as severe as one might expect to see in the us or europe
6097282 given asias importance in driving economic growth globally the strides we take today to advance our asian businesses will pay long term dividends

6097465 so i will carry on trying to beg borrow and steal to get one or two bodies who might do well for us
6097466 clubs like manchester united and chelsea dont have to do that good luck to them
6097467 this is really some disaster insurance is what these options are
6097468 the treasury and fed have basically said theyre there if they need help but with cost and that will be nearly 100 dilution in my view of current shareholders

6097473 if andrei could have tempered his financial appetite it was quite possible he would be playing at the emirates right now
6097474 arsene wenger is indeed a cunning fox who always says one thing and does the other he wanted andrei but arsenal are the only top english club who do not pay large salaries
6097475 but arsenal are the only top english club who do not pay large salaries
6097476 this was gabes decision totally but it was a smart decision on his part being a team guy and wanting to be on the field and wanting to play im proud of him
6097477 i think it gives him an opportunity at both after next year hes a junior one more year and give him a chance to get a look at the next level at both of them
6097478 today was his first time in full pads and did very good
6097479 hes just got a lot to learn i think as the year goes on he can really give us a lot of help there hes very athletic and he was a very good defensive player in high school

6097525 we see there is a role for technology but we have reservations about the role of this technology
6097526 it has been trialled in finland and portugal but the passenger traffic going through manchester is much greater
6097527 we have anecdotal evidence that the machines have had to be recalibrated because they were denying too many people entry
6097528 the government needs to make sure this technology is foolproof the last thing we need is another transport hub grinding to a halt
6097529 before we trialled it we consulted the portuguese who said they were satisfied with how it was working the uk borders agency interrogator and other experts have tested it for performance
6097530 in addition before it went live it was tested again by the uk border agency interrogator for accuracy and security during the pilot the border force will run its own tests on the system
6097531 as the minister of unity culture arts and heritage we should be instilling good culture in the young but here we are allowing other parties to organise things

6097542 w e plan to provide the hosted flash video files only to select affiliates who contact us regarding this promotion and who are willing to explain how and where they will be using the hosted files
6097543 we definitely wanted to hook up our affiliates with the promo content they were requesting
6097544 the legislative leaders understand we will not support a tax increase
6097545 i dont think the governor understands that it is so frustrating to sit through these meetings in his office how many times can we say no to taxes
6097546 i dont know if people realize what a big deal this is and how fortunate we are to be the cflcc headquarters in such an important international exercise
6097547 its a great opportunity for us to practice working with partner nations and their officers
6097548 panamax helps this division immensely not only with events in this exercise but it also helps us to prepare for future deployments
6097549 this pretty much keeps me going its the only thing that does
6097550 without it id just be hanging out in my room somewhere
6097551 this is one of the best things the armed forces could have done because its just therapy for these guys who feel like i lost this
6097552 jacob is a prime example hes really trying were thankful for the army for doing everything it can for him
6097553 im not back to where i was by any means
6097554 i just keep practicing and hope it eventually comes back
6097555 i have been roping with jacob since he was knee high to a grasshopper
6097556 i just dont have words to explain the love that we have for jacob and how much we enjoy ourselves doing what we do
6097557 when hes on horseback or working out hes a normal guy
6097558 but well be sitting at the house watching tv or something and it aint the same guy we drove six or seven hundred miles to the world finals 14 hours of drive time and he probably said three words but you stick him on a horse or in the gym where his comfort zone is and hes fine
6097559 we have response mechanisms in place for each and every one of those systems
6097560 they receive priority medical care and they live in the best and newest billets that this installation has to offer
6097561 i would like to stress that in both cases the mold found was as a result of a command directed inspection in accordance with programs that are designed to be proactive and identify problems that may impact on soldiers
6097562 there isnt mold in these rooms but we need to be proactive
6097563 were doing this recovery training so our new personnel can get ready for combat scenarios
6097564 we need to show them how to get in and out very quickly especially when bullets are flying
6097565 we have to just in case something goes down its good to have everybody out there to do one anothers job so we can do the mission
6097566 you always have to keep in mind things such as wench cable snapping pinch points getting crushed between vehicles this is pretty realistic when you get around fort hood in november
6097567 every situation is going to be different and it depends on the terrain too
6097568 i had no idea id be doing this i just expected to weld
6097569 im actually having a lot of fun out here im happy about getting to learn more than just my job
6097570 they do it all these guys do a lot of work
6097571 the c ram initiative at jrtc has made significant strides in improving the force protection training for army brigade combat teams bcts as they prepare for eventual deployments to iraq and afghanistan
6097572 the great training that jrtc and the c ram program office provides here will continue to lay the foundation for success this training provides the maneuver commander with another tool to defeat the perimeter threat that we see today in theater
6097573 ibdsos provides the fob commander with an integrated set of capabilities that is designed to protect against and defeat perimeter threats
6097574 ibdsos is an integral part of c ram and provides the ground commander with additional capabilities to help defeat the insurgent threat and prevent loss of life
6097575 the ibdsos training that weve received here has been outstanding
6097576 our ability to immediately get eyes on a potential threat allows us to provide immediate early warning of a potential attack to personnel on the fob and that helps us save lives
6097577 fully incorporating all the joint assets into ibdsos training also means improving the ability to provide early warning to personnel located on the fobs and give forces time to take appropriate actions and defeat this type of irregular warfare threat eventually we will digitally integrate ibdsos and c ram system information with joint fires and command and control systems that will greatly improve shared situational awareness among coalition forces and make it easier to defeat fob threats
6097578 our ability to integrate joint assets with our own fires capabilities cuts down on the time to gain a positive identification on a threat and that helps us to respond quickly and appropriately
6097579 ibdsos provides us with a mission essential capability that will give our unit an unprecedented level of force protection once we deploy in theater
6097580 as the database of mendeley web grows you will be able to view statistics about emerging research topics in every academic discipline and readership statistics for each individual paper
6097581 soon we will also include a recommendation engine basically its like a last fm for research
6097582 there are plenty of websites that want to become the facebook for researchers
6097583 mendeley however is not just another social network its a truly valuable integration of software and web technologies that solves some of researchers day to day problems which is why we decided to invest
6097584 youre talking less than a point of being in the final which makes it even more difficult to take
6097585 i was nervous which is kind of typical at least for me at the beginning of the match i was kind of tight i was probably being more careful than what i normally am i was a little bit leery of trying to shade
6097586 i wanted to shoot in a condition but it was just coming and going the condition wouldnt stay there
6097587 because i was being a little too careful that may have cost me a couple of points
6097588 it wasnt until about halfway through the match that i loosened up a little bit and started to shade more often
6097589 if i had done that in the beginning i might have fared a little better but shading is kind of risky theres no science to it or formula that you can figure out its just an instinct type kind of shooting
6097590 that hurt thats just tough to take ive been training hard i think i performed pretty decently today maybe i was a little too tentative and a little too careful and i probably shouldve been shading from the very start
6097591 ill never forget the experience in 04 but this has been a great experience too what more can you ask for than another chance to represent the united states and the u s army you cant ask for anything more than that
6097592 i love doing this i love representing the united states and representing the u s army theres not a better feeling than to do that
6097593 we did all the tourist stuff then the great wall the silk market and all the shopping
6097594 this time ive been trying to stay focused we have our apartment where were all staying in the olympic village and between there the dining facility and the range thats where ive been this whole shooting complex is just a beautiful facility they really did a great job of putting it together
6097595 theres so much emotion going on right now that its a tough decision to make but this will probably be my last olympics ive been doing this for a long time now its time to do something else maybe something still within the sport of shooting a coaching job or something like that
6097596 i dont even want to say because i hate to be one of those who comes out of retirement
6097597 its tough to do especially in this sport where you can do it as long as you have the desire to compete and i still have the desire to compete i just dont know
6097598 to put four years of your life into an hour and 15 minutes thats hard to do
6097599 we do a lot of family stuff but maybe its time to start focusing on them more and what they want to do in life
6097600 the youngest one loves to shoot and i want to be able to give him the time that my dad was able to give me which you have to start at a young age i think its time to give back a little not only to my own kids but to other shooters
6097601 i plan on retiring from the army probably this time next year
6097602 if there is a coaching job available at the u s army marksmanship unit i will definitely apply for that position with my military background i think it would be a good fit and there are probably a couple other opportunities that will be available when i retire
6097603 ive been with the amu off and on my whole career
6097604 ive done tours in korea for 14 months and four years in fort hood texas i also went to airborne school ranger school and all the other army officer schools
6097605 the world class athlete program is just a superb program its just an amazing opportunity that the army provides and a lot of people dont know that opportunity exists
6097606 it just exemplifies what the military is all about it wants soldiers to be successful and thats one of the ways it provides an opportunity for a soldier to be successful in something that he loves to do

6097609 firefighters continue to be called upon to respond to many types of incidents disasters and situations in all kinds of weather day and night
6097610 our coun trys fire service is an amazing cadre of specially trained individuals whom the public relies on during emergencies including extreme weather and natural disasters this requires all firefighters to be prepared to respond in the most challenging conditions
6097611 the usfa is pleased to provide this critical information in support of not only this important department of homeland security initiative but also to continue our mission of ensuring the fire service is capable of responding to any and all emergencies regardless of scope
6097612 we are preparing defensive postures we checked the barangays on the drills when there would be attacks
6097613 we have to protect ourselves we dont want to be at the mercy of these armed elements and then the military could not warrant our safety they come late
6097614 they could not carry these guns with them wherever they go only in the areas where they are confined
6097615 i have as much authority as the pope i just dont have as many people who believe it
6097616 im completely in favor of the separation of church and state my idea is that these two institutions screw us up enough on their own so both of them together is certain death

6097620 the long distance heart to heart actually began when jen desperate for a sympathetic ear called her former mother in law jane pitt on aug 13 at ch teau miraval where shes staying with brad angelina jolie and their brood
6097621 jen still calls jane all the time and she really needed someone to talk to
6097622 and she started telling jane about her split with john
6097623 but he listened very intently and tried to comfort her he was very patient and attentive
6097624 she is so intent on getting married and having children he felt hemmed in
6097625 in the same way that fogs or electrical storms can sometimes impact on airport operations now some flights to and from sydney airport may be delayed or aircraft may need to divert to other airports
6097626 in the worst case scenario it could last for hours and put a delay into the system which has an obvious knock on effect
6097627 he sprayed something briefly on the surface of my leg and i experienced what felt like an incision deep into the flesh i let out a cry of pain he looked at me for a moment and without saying a word he went on with his work
6097628 again he cut into my leg the pain was so excruciating that i asked have you got ether or something again he said nothing i could feel the implement being dragged through my flesh
6097629 well your mum shouldnt have been in the sun all her life otherwise she wouldnt be in this mess
6097630 a conspiracy on the part of medical regulators his competitors people from his past whom he has displeased and the many people who have complained about him
6097631 i offered him a beer and he had a drink with me
6097632 i pushed him back in the chest area he took one or two steps back but he kept taking it as a joke
6097633 then he came at me a bit fast then went to tackle me like in a bear hug around my waist i was trying to struggle and shake him out of it
6097634 i had the knife in my right pocket i opened it in my pocket and i just quickly pulled it out and stabbed him it happened really fast
6097635 its small and compact but a very very capable device with great battery life

6097641 one of the men ran towards the third security guard who was positioned across the road adjacent to the getaway car raised his firearm at the guard and the guard in self defence fired one shot
6097642 i heard the first shot then after one second i heard a second shot i went to the front of the shop and saw the security guard with the gun out
6097643 he was good man he was the best guy in the world
6097644 everybody is so upset its a shock to all of us but thats part of life
6097645 i understand the department of defence has some specialist equipment at its disposal namely a fuel bladder which could be used to transport the orphaned whale calf in sydneys pittwater

6097649 die spekulationen der vp entbehren jeder grundlage die wiener wasserwerke investieren j hrlich mehr als 20 millionen euro in die erhaltung des rohrnetzes die rohrstr nge werden laufende erneuert

6097651 eine gleichzeitige erneuerung wie stiftner das offenbar will w rde nicht nur die trinkwasserversorgung der wiener haushalte unm glich machen sondern den verkehr in wien auf jahre hinaus lahmlegen

6097659 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6097660 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6097661 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6097662 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6097663 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6097664 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6097665 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6097666 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6097667 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6097668 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6097669 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6097670 dna evidence and photo evidence of the creature will be presented

6097673 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6097674 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6097675 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6097676 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6097677 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6097678 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6097679 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6097680 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6097681 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6097682 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6097683 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6097684 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6097685 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6097686 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
6097687 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6097688 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6097689 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6097690 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6097691 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6097692 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6097693 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6097694 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6097695 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6097696 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6097697 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6097698 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest

6097700 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6097701 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6097702 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6097703 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration

6097709 we warned these whores but they did not stop their business said the note left with the bodies of the women one of whom was in her 20s
6097710 umar said verily allah sent muhammad with truth and revealed the book to him out of the verses the almighty allah revealed there was the verse of stoning to death the messenger of allah stoned to death sahih muslim page 920 and after him we also stoned to death and in the book of god stoning to death is a truth against one who commits adultery the verse was thus the old man and the old woman if they have committed adultery they stoned them both assuredly
6097711 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6097712 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6097713 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6097714 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6097715 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6097716 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6097717 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6097718 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6097719 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6097720 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6097721 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6097722 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6097723 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6097724 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6097725 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6097726 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6097727 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6097728 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6097729 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6097730 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6097731 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6097732 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6097733 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6097734 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6097735 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6097736 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6097737 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6097738 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6097739 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6097740 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6097741 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6097742 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6097743 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6097744 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6097745 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6097746 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6097747 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did

6097749 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today

6097767 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6097768 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6097769 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6097770 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6097771 this is a planning took where all things are going
6097772 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6097773 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6097774 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6097775 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6097776 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6097777 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6097778 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6097779 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6097780 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6097781 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6097782 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6097783 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6097784 oh no its not 20 yuan its 20 yuan per person
6097785 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6097786 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6097787 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6097788 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6097789 sapp has not been invited the past few bn supreme councils and management meetings so the position of sapp in bn better be answered by the prime minister whom we have no confidence in the deputy prime minister or the secretary general of bn

6097813 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6097814 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6097815 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6097816 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6097817 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6097818 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6097819 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6097820 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6097821 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6097822 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6097823 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6097824 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6097825 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6097826 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6097827 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6097828 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

6097830 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6097831 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6097832 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6097833 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

6097838 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6097839 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6097840 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

6097842 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6097843 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6097844 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6097845 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6097846 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6097847 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6097848 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6097849 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6097850 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6097851 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6097852 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6097853 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6097854 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6097855 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6097856 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

6097865 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6097866 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6097867 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6097868 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6097869 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6097870 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6097871 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6097872 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6097873 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6097874 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6097875 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6097876 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6097877 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything

6097886 the georgia russia military clash over the breakaway region of ossetia is being viewed in washington intelligence circles as a failure of u s policy toward russia a policy that has relied on the personal diplomacy of president bush rather than on u s national interest bush has stated repeatedly in the past that he believes world problems can be worked out when leaders have good personal relations and he specifically stated that his contact with former russian president vladimir putin was the key to keeping moscow from becoming a hostile anti democratic power however russia over the past eight years has moved steadily away from democracy and toward anti democratic authoritarianism the attacks by russian strategic bombers and missiles on georgia represent the first real post soviet threats from moscow the russian military attacks on georgia in the aftermath of georgias military incursion into ossetia where russia was covertly backing separatist rebels are the most visible failure of u s policy toward russia that has been marked by damaging neglect on the part of the white house national security council staff the state department and to a lesser extent the pentagon state department officials in particular ignored russias slide toward neo sovietism claiming in internal policy papers that moscow remained committed to pro u s pro democratic reform policies these officials failed to recognize that moscow based on its opposition to a u s missile defense site in central europe had shifted dramatically against the united states senior bush aides including secretary of state condoleezza rice and defense secretary robert gates have expressed publicly that they did not understand russian opposition to the missile defense site in poland and czech republic

6098128 contrary to expectations there hasnt been any dramatic move to downbeat macro economic factors on compensation instead companies are looking at innovative ways to cut other costs like travel and recreation without compromising on employee salaries or learning and development this is a healthy sign of a growing and mature economy the war for talent is not over and the current blip is transient hence organizations realize that they have to manage the talent supply for the long term and not the downturn
6098129 organizations need to set new performance agenda and reassess if their compensation strategy is driving organizational and employee performance
6098130 the job market has slowed down considerably across sectors and the irrational salary offers being given to hire talent in the past will now be restricted to a much smaller population companies should focus on grooming internal talent and build from within to manage their future talent needs

6098141 we often discover that students figs led them into their current major and that they thoroughly enjoyed courses they otherwise wouldnt have thought about
6098142 i usually tell students about my experience which was phenomenal and how it actually shaped my major i have today
6098143 its an incredible advantage to work with a small group of students at a school thats so massive we easily organized study groups and discovered that across the board we generally did better on exams than non fig sections
6098144 i felt like i got so much more out of the course material than my classmates who werent in figs

6098146 the program is designed to create a beneficial experience for students but faculty members say its changed the way they view freshmen and the way they teach
6098147 its the most rewarding teaching experience ive had at this university
6098148 the close personal working relationship with the students makes it very easy to generate discussion and first semester freshmen have a natural enthusiasm when beginning college
6098149 i can count on my students having read certain plays by shakespeare or tragedies by sophocles and i can expect them to bring those to our discussion

6098170 we dont have to start ordaining women but can we at least invite women in and just listen can we shut up long enough to hear their stories their experiences of being marginalized in the church can we hear the pain they feel
6098171 what do we say to janice and other women who say they are called by god to be priests

6098184 mortgage rates held relatively steady for the second week in a row amid offsetting economic data releases
6098185 for instance consumer credit grew by 14 billion in june more than twice the market consensus but retail sales were weaker in july
6098186 news was mixed for the housing market as well pending existing home sales unexpectedly rose in june signaling a possible increase in home sales in july and august according to the national association of realtors offsetting that information was the news that commercial banks tightened lending standards even more for prime nontraditional and subprime mortgages in july according to the federal reserve an action that may dampen further home sales activity going forward
6098187 the pace of decline has intensified due to job cuts and very sluggish economic activity since the beginning of the year particularly in those industries requiring commercial building spaces
6098188 we anticipate the weakest commercial brokerage activity in nearly three years as a result
6098189 uc researchers have found that more than 30 percent of american public schools are within 400 meters or a quarter mile of major highways that consistently serve as main truck and traffic routes
6098190 research has shown that proximity to major highways and thus environmental pollutants such as aerosolizing diesel exhaust particles can leave school age children more susceptible to respiratory diseases later in life

6098193 in the present case the mdc has not consented to the convening of the parliament
6098194 any decision to convene parliament will be a clear repudiation of the mou and an indication beyond reasonable doubt of unwillingness to continue to be part of the talks
6098195 it is their choice provided they will not participate in parliament business chosing of the speaker and the deputy speaker before they have taken the oath of loyalty

6098224 we are well positioned for the downturn delivering the staple brand of choice for customers and consumers
6098225 our focus during the period will be on growing market share we are well placed to capitalise on the opportunities that will arise as conditions eventually improve

6098230 proportionate ebitda growth of 9 6 per cent in the face of the external environment represents an excellent achievement
6098231 it demonstrates the significant value which has been generated by the aeronautical and commercial initiatives map has underway at our airports
6098232 despite the strong performance and excellent positioning of our airports security price performance has been disappointing so far in 2008
6098233 whilst this is primarily a consequence of external factors beyond maps control action has nonetheless been taken to address this security price underperformance
6098234 boards and management are also seeking to address the gap between the current security price and the security value implied by directors valuations reaffirm the quality and sustainability of distributions and reinforce maps commitment to its traditional investment discipline

6098246 when i learned the symbol of the islamic faith will appear on coca cola packaging during ramadan 2008 i found myself wondering whether or not the atlanta based soft drink maker will soon include the christian cross and jewish star of david in future holiday packaging designs targeting people of those faiths
6098247 in a globalizing world ramadan presents an opportunity to showcase the true values of islam and what it stands for
6098248 because no other brand is as inclusive as and no other company is as diverse as coca cola we have a unique opportunity to play a valued role as an international bridge builder and facilitator of dialogue during ramadan
6098249 in addition to the focus on ramadan and eid the coca cola system has also implemented policies and programs to meet the needs of muslim employees such as providing halal food in cafeterias and organizing special prayer rooms at company facilities
6098250 we have always lived in a brutally difficult product landscape in the late 1990s netscape had gone from a position of having enormous market share for the browsers probably as high as in the 90s i think before microsoft got involved to a steadily declining market share partly because microsoft is a great competitor and theyve built some good products and partly because they engaged in a campaign of illegal activities and then you combine those and the netscape market share had been dropping steadily for quite some time so its clear that the way of producing a browser and how we were trying to keep choice and alternatives alive had to be done differently thus open source

6098331 ze zijn sneller kleiner en ze hebben minder stroom nodig ssds zijn niet mechanisch dus ze zijn betrouwbaarder dan harde schijven
6098332 met verloop van tijd zal de prijs dalen maar ik ben ervan overtuigd dat de meeste gebruikers systemen zullen hebben waarin zowel ssd als een traditionele harde schijf worden gebruikt een ssd geeft een computer een flinke snelheidsboost terwijl een normale harde schijf het grootste gedeelte van de data opslaat

6098373 though there is evidence both for and against the existence of a detectable anthropogenic signal in the tropical cyclone climate record to date no firm conclusion can be made on this point no individual tropical cyclone can be directly attributed to climate change
6098374 numerous hurricane meteorologists agree that the historical data has not produced any evidence of changes due to climate change in the number or intensity of hurricanes particularly in the atlantic basin and even globally
6098375 there are some who have done studies that do claim a link but virtually all those studies have been heavily rebutted by others in the hurricane community
6098376 in my opinion the flaw in those studies is an improper utilization of historical databases i have been a specialist in hurricane climate data for close to three decades and others who know the databases well agree with what i am saying
6098377 the biggest fallacy is that people think that a hurricane feeds off a warm ocean and if the ocean gets warmer we will have more intense hurricanes
6098378 but there are other factors involved such as vertical wind shear which is the difference between the upper and lower layers of the atmosphere you could also have drier air these are far more critical factors than the ocean being warmer
6098379 everything else being equal if you warm the ocean under a storm you might get a stronger storm but everything else is not equal
6098380 warming may increase vertical shear and therefore inhibit storms the ocean itself warming is such a little effect
6098381 we cant even reliably forecast el ni o when you look 50 years into the future youre getting a picture but could you be totally wrong yes
6098382 i am skeptical of those who would state those results as something like an undeniable fact for the future
6098383 it is a possible guide for the future but certainly the models are not pointing to increased activity
6098384 i did not say if there is global warming it would be man made
6098385 not all scientists agree that the warming weve seen is necessarily anthropogenic it is a blatant lie put forth in the media that makes it seem there is only a fringe of scientists who dont buy into anthropogenic global warming
6098386 there is now a near consensus that global air temperatures are increasing however there is no consensus on how this has affected the temperature of the worlds oceans and in particular in the atlantic ocean or how much of the recent warming trend is attributable to mans activities
6098387 recent scientific research indicates that in a future warming world the atlantic may experience two primary effects related to hurricane development
6098388 first a warmer environment may continue to elevate sea surface temperatures ssts thereby providing more fuel for tropical cyclones to develop and intensify
6098389 so while it is true that warmer ssts may lead to more frequent hurricane activity elevated wind shear may counteract or possibly even overturn this effect
6098390 which of these factors critical to the development of tropical cyclones will ultimately win out is the subject of lively debate within the scientific community and beyond
6098391 for example simulations of tropical cyclone activity carried out at the gfdl using climate conditions projected for the 21st century indicate the potential for decreased hurricane activity under more pronounced global warming conditions and cautions against a reliance on statistical extrapolations of recently elevated activity levels through the end of the century
6098392 it is not clear what effect global warming is having and will have on the frequency intensity and geographical distribution of hurricanes in the atlantic basin
6098393 however models are less clear about hurricane activity in individual ocean basins
6098394 for instance in the atlantic some models suggest a long term increase in frequency with others suggesting a decrease
6098395 the evidence shows that there has been an increase in the average intensity of hurricanes in the atlantic since the 1970s and an increase in frequency since 1995 but it is not clear what contribution if any global warming has made to these changes
6098396 professor gray is absolutely correct that hurricane formation and development depend on factors such as sea surface temperature
6098397 however it would be wrong to suggest that these factors could only be affected by natural changes in climate and not by man made global warming
6098398 both natural climate variability and man made global warming influence hurricane formation and development
6098399 the real question is to what extent they contribute over the time scale of interest this is still an open scientific question
6098400 for the layman there is sometimes a tendency to regard every new discovery or scientific finding from the latest published paper as an inviolate fact
6098401 in reality rarely is there ever a last and final word in studies of complex systems such as earths environment rather science is a dynamic process based on the scientific method in which researchers test hypotheses leading to new discoveries but also reexamine earlier theories and try to improve build upon or extend them

6098444 i took this in a park in madrid kurt had no energy no interest in anything it was funny because dave grohl and krist novoselic were the nicest guys you could ever hope to meet but kurt just seemed frustrated courtney love his wife had come to meet him on tour and she loved being the centre of attention it was a nightmare to take the picture i had to wait around for hours and the pr kept ringing up to say kurt and courtney were still holed up in their hotel room id spent days on the road with nirvana in the us when the first album came out in 1989 back then kurt had been much more engaging none of them was doing drugs as much i guess he became disenchanted with the music industry the tours all the promotional stuff he just wanted to be in a little punk rock band
6098445 the rolling stones were the first big band i ever photographed this is the first time they were on television in july 1963 when they were plugging their first record i was 22 and had been working for tatler taking pictures of debutantes which i was delighted to be away from brian had his little gang of groupies and hes signing autographs for them here in those days when they were building the group they were nice to everybody we used to go out after gigs and id buy them chickens from the barbecue on the kings road as there wasnt any mcdonalds back then it was only later that they really started doing drugs i reckoned brian only did them because he was miserable with what was going on in the group he was the leader really but there was so much infighting to get rid of him particularly from mick and keith without him though the stones would never have existed
6098446 in this picture janis is reading a comic on the plane to a gig in detroit she didnt always read comics though she was very literate she was one of the few performers i got to know personally while i was photographing in new york i found her to be loving considerate and lonely she seemed to experience pain even when she was having pleasure that she couldnt get as high in real life as she did from her performances saddened and depressed her one night after a big show in new york i shared a cab with her and a few other members of the band she directed the cab to drive to the home of a casual friend who she hoped was there when she got out she shook her head and with a sad smile said man what a drag here i am a big star and i cant find anyone to be with

6098639 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
6098640 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
6098641 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

6098646 if a child has been diagnosed with adhd a teacher may think they should be put in a special class they could be disadvantaged
6098647 the semifinals are designed to get rid of the weaker runners and obviously i wasnt going to get a medal on the back of that performance even if id made the final
6098648 it hurts because i believe im a good distance runner and to finish fifth in that race if i did that in europe id be a bit disappointed but ill press on unfortunately its the semi final of the olympics and they take only four
6098649 nothing was wrong id trained perfectly the preparation was great i did the race i wanted too i was relaxed and watching the screen to know what was going on when the pressure came on i wasnt good enough simple
6098650 i felt good believe it or not for 11 laps it was actually my turn to break out but the qatari beat me to it and i thought that was ok ill just follow him
6098651 after about 50 or 60 metres of that i couldnt go anymore i dont know why it just wasnt good enough ive got no excuses every heat was just as hard as the other
6098652 if i was concerned about not being in the top four id have taken the pace up myself i backed my ability and it bit me on the ar e
6098653 the olympics is where everyones at their best and i believed i was its not as easy as it looks you can be comfortable running 66s or 67s which i was then the injection of pace it stung me ive got no excuses i just didnt have it
6098654 with about 600m to go the gap really opened up it was tough
6098655 im disappointed i wanted to make the final but ill look at it tomorrow before deciding how bad it was it certaibly didnt seem to go to plan
6098656 i sweat like this after most 5ks so its hard to tell if the heat was a factor i didnt notice it during the race it wasnt overpowering
6098657 i drew a bit of a short straw with the heats with an olympic champion and multiple world championship medallist so i had to go out and give it a go as one of the fastest qualifiers
6098658 but like the rest of the team i got a virus a few days ago ive been in bed for three days until yesterday that just hit me with 300m to go i was feeling good but couldnt finish it off
6098659 youre not going to chase those guys down if you give them a 10m start so i had to be able to hit the front its prettyy devastating but you can only deal with the cards youre dealt
6098660 after our last talk with him he agreed to go to another country in asia

6098667 its diverse its like no other programme i have ever worked on it encompasses everything from the middle east peace process to the latest jilly cooper novel
6098668 apart from the early starts which are tough i cannot think of anything else i would rather do
6098669 i did well today i felt some pressure during the performance but i tried to tell myself that it was a training not a competition
6098670 theres no question we did the right thing in holding the opening ceremony to air in prime time on nbc that night the excitement that built out of word of mouth that the opening ceremony was the most spectacular thing that people had seen that china had wanted to make a statement and they made a statement and people wanted to see that
6098671 no matter how much you score it doesnt change the outcome we lost by 30 points but it was a great feeling to be out there
6098672 personally it is just a great feeling to be involved in the greatest basketball tournament in the world
6098673 at the start of second half we wanted to come out and we had a particular set we wanted to run i had a lot of good looks and knocked them down
6098674 we know they are a good team they execute very well but our biggest strength is our depth we are going to wear you down
6098675 standing on the sideline you are 25 down and it is late in the game and you look at the scorers table and they are bringing in kobe and carmelo it was too much for us
6098676 defensively they are playing great together and everyone is making contributions they will be tough to beat
6098677 the most difficult things is going to bed my body wants to go to sleep at 7ish but my mind wants to stay up and watch tv until late
6098678 its going to be a constant battle waking up in the dark isnt much fun rob bonnet did warn me
6098679 i want the viewer to get involved i want them to meet the major players whether its the olympic gold medallist an international striker or the head of the governing body

6098681 i used to play sport at quite a high level i played first class cricket and football for charlton reserves a few years ago 10 in fact and my father john was a footballer for chelsea arsenal and england
6098682 so sport is in the blood when you are a sport presenter you can still get involved you can enjoy the highs and lows and you dont have to get muddy breakfast is brilliant for that we travel to the major events we can part of the whole experience and also involve the viewers
6098683 ive always been inspired by those events or people who compel us to look at the bigger picture and question our ethics my heroes at home were martin bell kate adie and sir ranulph fiennes
6098684 its taken me a while to get to report from abroad but i have loved the path in between
6098685 its the variety the diversity of subjects im called upon to cover and of course broadcasting live for three hours a day is the biggest buzz and keeps me mentally agile
6098686 clearly cable remains very strong even in an environment of fierce competition
6098687 firstly telenet has significantly lowered the customers entry threshold by making the rental fee of digiboxes as low as possible

6098689 flexview also contributes significantly to idtvs enormous success flexview allows digital viewers to pause live broadcasts or rewind television programmes this allows viewers to compile their own television evening fully independent of the existing programming
6098690 michael probably wont be fit and mark viduka certainly wont be
6098691 i probably could rush michael back and then knock him back five or six weeks
6098692 we are probably strong enough to do without the two of them but when they come back it will give us a massive boost
6098693 i dont think his training has been geared to that part yet
6098694 but in a few years it will be and then i will be ready to kiss my record goodbye
6098695 my preparation is going well we have to wait and see what happens in the final

6098711 passage of licensing and or registration in the next congress
6098712 we have found 133 victims but there are mass burial places which we cannot open
6098713 hebron is a breakthrough agreement for the province and this is a day that all newfoundlanders and labradorians can take pride in and celebrate
6098714 the signing of this agreement reflects a bold new era of partnership between government and our industry partners we have real and meaningful ownership of our resources in the form of an equity stake in this project and a new super royalty regime we have achieved significant commitments for local benefits for fabrication and engineering and are now embarking on a major industrial project that will fill our fabrication yards and employ thousands of newfoundlanders and labradorians this marks our emergence as a full participant on the global energy stage and we are pleased to join with our industry co venturers in the commencement of this project
6098715 we are soon to become a have province and finally newfoundland and labrador is being recognized for the long standing contributions we have made to the canadian federation
6098716 these contributions will continue and expand as the hebron project comes on stream
6098717 the co venturers look forward to progressing the project through the various stages of front end engineering to sanction and execution
6098718 during construction and throughout the production phase the hebron project will deliver significant benefits to the people of newfoundland and labrador generate a competitive rate of return for chevron and our co venture companies including the provinces energy corporation and provide additional energy supplies for the north american marketplace
6098719 the hebron project will provide the opportunity for as much work as our fabrication facilities including bull arm and marystown can handle
6098720 the gravity base structure gbs will be constructed in the province and is expected to generate over four million person hours of construction employment alone the hebron project commits more fabrication work within the province than the terra nova or white rose projects as a result of the world class expertise and capacity that we have developed here

6098725 we have found the best partner to accelerate our progress in greater china and asia i am delighted at the prospect of working with eric yim and his talented team as we extend our reach together
6098726 we are very excited to be partnering with john portlock and the herman miller team
6098727 this alliance will not only provide broader capacity and capability in distribution and servicing our customers but also improve the value proposition for our combined high design product portfolios in the asia pacific region
6098728 thanks very much stick around for caribou which you will of course do as they are the ones you are here to see
6098729 most u s households use mass market insurance companies which may not provide the breadth of coverage they need
6098730 this quality comes without the high price tag you might expect aig private client group programs feature competitive pricing without sacrificing quality of service or breadth of coverage
6098731 the global economic downturn has caused a slowdown in the construction industry and the company must respond to this change in market conditions to protect the long term future of welsh slate and its employees
6098732 we will do everything possible to ensure that the necessary reduction in staffing numbers can be achieved through a voluntary redundancy programme and offer whatever support and assistance we can to staff during this difficult period
6098733 the polyketal microparticles we developed are simply a vehicle to get the drugs inside the body to the diseased area as quickly as possible
6098734 the major advantage to using these polyketals to deliver drugs is that they degrade into biocompatible compounds that dont accumulate in a patients tissue or cause additional inflammation
6098735 we think these microparticles are going to be fantastic for oral drug delivery because they can survive the stomach conditions before they release their contents in the intestines
6098736 patients with acute liver failure need drugs as soon as possible or else theyll die
6098737 weve tailored the polyketals hydrolysis rates to deliver the drug in one or two days
6098738 delivering proteins inside microparticles has been limited because getting the protein into the microparticles required organic solvents that frequently destroyed the proteins
6098739 to overcome this problem we developed a method of simply immobilizing the protein on the surface of the microparticles
6098740 in the past few years we have developed methods to tailor the polyketals properties which have already allowed us to target many different medical conditions but our end goal is to test these treatments in humans
6098741 to our fans it is with huge regret and disappointment that we have been forced to cancel our imminent european festival appearances at leeds reading 2 days a week area 4 as well as exclusive performances for mtv europe and virgin tv
6098742 contrary to expectations there hasnt been any dramatic move to downbeat macro economic factors on compensation instead companies are looking at innovative ways to cut other costs like travel and recreation without compromising on employee salaries or learning and development this is a healthy sign of a growing and mature economy the war for talent is not over and the current blip is transient hence organizations realize that they have to manage the talent supply for the long term and not the downturn
6098743 organizations need to set new performance agenda and reassess if their compensation strategy is driving organizational and employee performance
6098744 the job market has slowed down considerably across sectors and the irrational salary offers being given to hire talent in the past will now be restricted to a much smaller population companies should focus on grooming internal talent and build from within to manage their future talent needs
6098745 india is currently mirroring the global macroeconomic scenario however indias domestic consumption story remains intact while salary increases in india have been between 14 15 since 2004 a slightly lowered projection is not a sign of worry this is a good time for organizations to consolidate their hr strategies towards a high performance orientation and also look at removing redundancies from their organization structures
6098746 we are happy to offer networking and connectivity product line

6098750 this is fantastic news for our clients and for the future of cfds in canada
6098751 what this means is that contracts for difference cfds now come under ida oversight clients also receive enhanced protection through the canadian investor protection fund which is another major benefit of ida membership
6098752 being recognized by the ida is another important milestone in our canadian growth strategy as we continue to solidify our position as one of the countrys premier trading firms
6098753 for more than 250 years timelines have been a useful tool for the temporal visualization of events
6098754 my timeline originally published in 1994 is unique in its use of quantitative and qualitative data across a variety of domains as well as historical and futures perspectives
6098755 the next two to three decades will see deep fundamental changes occurring across multiple technological social political economic and environmental domains this timeline was developed as a tool to provide insights that will help us understand these changes
6098756 timelines can be a powerfully effective tool for analyzing events both in the past and the future providing insights into long term changes and provoking thought and discussion about the future
6098757 we feel that our timeline offers greater insight than many others with its uniquely rich overlays of events trends drivers and archetypal patterns of change spanning america and the world
6098758 peter von stacklebergs development of the strategy of timelining the visual representation of the events of history by kind in parallel and correlated tiers represents a major qualitative breakthrough in providing a more systematic understanding of the past explanation of the present and grounded forecasting of the future
6098759 corporate librarians are faced with many challenges today they are not only asked to be knowledge experts they also need to be information providers technology consultants and project managers
6098760 building an elibrary involves more than simply assembling a collection of resources this paper looks at the full picture and equips librarians with the tools to write a compelling business case for their elibrary projects
6098761 our representations to government have been about trying to decouple the idea of having channel a originally mooted for narrowcast tv services and channel b planned for mobile tv as the one package and move ahead of the allocation of the mobile licence
6098762 i think theres opportunities for mobile tv in australia considering there are more mobile telephones in australia than there are people
6098763 nearly 17 million australians have watched all or part of our coverage over the past 10 days a figure very close to the audience reach achieved in the coverage of the games in sydney
6098764 it is the same broadcast production model as undertaken during the olympic games in sydney given the timezone similarities indeed we are probably exceeding live or near live on these games more than other games
6098765 viewers are probably more aware of the games as our record breaking audiences underline given it is happening in our time and not overnight
6098766 were television covering an olympic games were not a wire service or online
6098767 we are producing television coverage that engages our audience of true sports fans and the millions of australians who follow the olympic games once every four years
6098768 our broadcast reflects the news and human interest and competition of the games
6098769 i look after all the businesses that are frankly not an advertising agency
6098770 currently the biggest unit in the group which was formed last week is creative activation
6098771 until last week it was called csmg deeply unsexy and it consisted of a whole bunch of brands that operated under three businesses which in turn had worked with a range of partners around the country
6098772 we have brought those partners into the group and have diluted our shareholding in order to give all these people a majority and we have called it creative activation
6098773 so if you go into a store and speak to the sony guy in the sony shirt he actually works for us
6098774 it means we now have the ultimate end to end in all these new companies including mystery shopping and all
6098775 the new company will be the first integrated group in australasia to create execute and measure brand strategies under one roof
6098776 i think that is a real tribute to the people in the group
6098777 nothing could be further away from what bbdo does and yet when you look at bbdo clients every one of them is in the retail environment so hopefully more and more we will be able to say to those clients you can talk to us about your retail environment talk to us about how you train and that sort of stuff and we can do it with an informed point of view rather than an adman who pretends he knows what a gondola is which historically has been a bit the case
6098778 wenn die m glichkeit bestehen sollte mal zwei drei spiele am st ck zu machen ist das die chance die man nutzen muss
6098779 seit jahren zeige ich in der bundesliga und champions league konstant topleistungen stattdessen wird ein hildebrand nominiert der auf der bank sitzt oder enke der mit hannover im mittelfeld spielt
6098780 einige aussagen von timo nach der em haben uns berhaupt nicht gefallen
6098781 the product finder is the biggest search engine optimisation party you can have to bring people to your site this thing is going to grow so fast
6098782 the magazine websites in no way can cover beauty to the same extent we do
6098783 the niche content model is really powerful you will see a lot more of these sort of pure play destination sites being carved out online
6098784 it will be a very competitive couple of months until the end of the year
6098785 thats the year regardless of what events are broadcast and we must remind ourselves that nine this year has had a lot of unusual cricket scheduling across the first four weeks of the survey year and will have a rugby league world cup across the final four weeks of the year
6098786 the people who stump up as partners or sponsors get the pick and take all the good inventory
6098787 all the gold medal events were pre ordered in a workshop run by seven in the lead up to beijing
6098788 if there are no aussies in a final the audience drops by between 10 per cent and 15 per cent
6098789 in the second week the audience is always lower by about 10 per cent
6098790 it wasnt an issue until the beginning of this year when the networks started broadcasting different hd content
6098791 people are now understanding more about what they are missing out on so the issue will just become bigger
6098792 seven and ten did a great job of advertising them their hd channels but we failed as a group to tell consumers that if you invested in an sd product you wont get all the hd channels
6098793 ten did the masters golf only on its hd channel so we had consumers bringing their tvs back because they couldnt see the golf
6098794 we were giving away hd boxes to consumers to appease their perception at the point of sale
6098795 so our concern about education is not the analogue to digital issue but the clarification of what digital tv you buy
6098796 the confusion needs to be eliminated so in terms of labelling not only do we need to state that this product is digital but that if you get hd you get all the channels
6098797 the secret about my business is the broadcasters offering content
6098798 in particular attention will be paid to the ability of fairfaxs newly diversified asset base to withstand a 2009 economic slowdown
6098799 we note from recent commentary from pmp that nz earnings from printing and distribution could decline by as much as 10 per cent in local currency terms
6098800 unlike some paper shuffling chiefs of staff david was very hands on
6098801 he had an excellent grasp of policy and he was very loyal
6098802 we havent had any problems with him either in opposition or since we came into office
6098803 optuss mounting litany of embarrassing failures shows it is not fit to be considered a builder of such an important network for this countrys future
6098804 we remove pbl media from our base case valuation for consmedia
6098805 we have valued pbl media at nil as we consider there is limited value in the equity held by the joint venture partners cvc and consmedia in light of the marginal interest cover
6098806 the protection of children from sexual abuse is of vital importance to society
6098807 it can have untold damaging effects on the lives of the persons affected
6098808 in this case i am satisfied that only a term of custody is appropriate
6098809 at the commission of these offences he was a child
6098810 most u s households use mass market insurance companies which may not provide the breadth of coverage they need
6098811 this quality comes without the high price tag you might expect aig private client group programs feature competitive pricing without sacrificing quality of service or breadth of coverage
6098812 jumbo salary increase for legislators what is good for political office holders is good for workers
6098813 the fresh 100 increase in the emoluments of legislators and local government chairpersons and councilors is worrisome we are concerned by the rather high margins of this frequent increases in the emoluments of political office holders
6098814 this increase will invariably add to the already bloated cost of maintaining public office holders which now constitute a huge drain on the development process
6098815 in advanced and emerging democracies selfless service is the operative philosophy in the compensation of parliamentarians and other political office holders
6098816 the reverse is unfortunately the case in nigeria as political office holders insist on living lavish lifestyles and in magnificent opulence at the expense of the resources that should have been invested in improving the lives of the people
6098817 we strongly believe that political office holders should appreciate the imperative of sacrifice and altruistic service rather than continue to make huge financial demands which undermine the development process this fresh increase has hideously distorted the reasonable relativity that had historically existed between the salaries of elected office holders and public employees
6098818 30 day ultimatum to constitute the boards of bayelsa and rivers states oil and gas commissions for the host communities
6098819 as early as 2004 when our employee base consisted of just 15 associates we made the decision not to develop an internal hr administrative department
6098820 about the time we reached 600 associates we started to evaluate alternatives mostly around hr systems we quickly eliminated the option of purchasing software and building an hr and it operations staff because again that option did not fit our corporate philosophy instead we decided on an approach in which the provider was responsible for managing and hosting a comprehensive fully integrated hr information system that met our unique needs this narrowed our search to just a few providers immediately
6098821 then as we got deeper into the evaluation of hr systems it became clear that the solution we really desired was broader than just access to good technology first we needed hr professionals with high competencies in the hr systems they used who would form a dedicated services team that was familiar with our business and who would manage our administrative workload and answer our associates calls using a devoted services center approach next we needed technologies that did more than the basics we needed technology that integrated the business processes between our management team our associates and the providers client team finally the solution had to fit within our budget constraints
6098822 going back to our corporate philosophy i mentioned that we are directed by our board to search out and implement any business solution that will free up time and capital our hr solution from platformone does both compared to the most conservative industry standards we would need 4 to 6 full time internal hr staff to administer our hr function for over 600 associates we require no it operating expense or personnel to run this solution best of all we avoided a huge capital outlay for hr software and technology infrastructure when you consider that the platformone solution meets our needs allows us to manage a single source provider relationship has been successfully implemented within our tight timeframes provides us superior day to day service response and costs 10 below the market price what more is there to ask a provider to do
6098823 girls can wear jeans and cut their hair short wear shirts and boots because its ok to be a boy but for a boy to look like a girl is degrading because you think that being a girl is degrading but secretly youd love to know what its like wouldnt you what it feels like for a girl

6098836 about interest groups struggling against other groups and finally making deals through politicians and agencies and courts
6098837 the only way to defeat one set of interests is with another set of interests
6098838 in the wake of hitler and stalin big ideas about the collective good had come to seem scary the prelude to mass murder
6098839 small bore struggle for advantage among constantly shifting coalitions of interest groups
6098840 you cant talk about morality as a force in politics because such talk is almost always a cover for somebodys interest
6098841 political passions represent something other than the promptings of pure justice one has to get over the habit of assuming that interests and worse lobbying and corruption are the province only of ones political opponents and not ones allies
6098842 to an unusual extent our presidential candidates this year got where they are by presenting themselves as reformers as champions of the transcendent public interest as the enemies of washington deal making as usual
6098843 it is permissible to use the word interests in a positive way only in the realm of foreign policy
6098844 were inclined to think that the wheedling of interest groups distorts politics
6098845 for bentley the working of interest groups in interaction with one another constitutes politics
6098846 the flaw in the pluralist heaven is that the heavenly chorus sings with a strong upper class accent
6098847 the lobbyists with the greatest power represent corporations followed by trade groups and then professional groups voluntary citizen groups who attract the bulk of attention from political science scholars amount to only a small sliver of the activity
6098848 if all organizations having representation in washington are considered the proportion representing the interests of business rose from 57 percent in 1960 to 72 percent in 1986

6098882 google is great for general searching but when you want to find very specific information on video surveillance topics it can be challenging

6098974 our experience tells us that young people rarely attend safety events such as open days
6098975 this campaign aims to take road safety education right to the places where they are already gathered for example car parks schools and night spots

6098977 we have spent a fair amount of time looking at this site already and we believe it is a very good site to erect a small wind farm
6098978 the problem is our society just accepts female violence it accepts violence in general
6098979 but there are always campaigns aimed at stopping male violence we need to accept no violence

6098993 a woman had called 911 complaining her fianc had been drinking and pushed her onto their bed

6099025 obama still has work to do on his base at this point mccain seems to be doing a better job with his
6099026 there were no wild swings there isnt one group that is radically different than last month or even two months ago it was just a steady decline for obama across the board

6099335 i have enjoyed my time at penyrheol studying for gcses although the pressure at some points was very high
6099336 i have also enjoyed the role of chairing the school council alongside fran roberts head girl of penyrheol comprehensive
6099337 the role of head boy developed not only my practical skills such as organisational public speaking and leadership skills but also allowed me to develop my personal skills as i am required to deal with personal issues in confidence

6099362 receiving the body and blood of christ unworthily is a sacrilege
6099363 if it is done deliberately in mortal sin it is a sacrilege
6099364 public officials who with knowledge and consent uphold actions that are against the divine and eternal moral law for example if they support abortion which entails the taking of innocent and defenseless human lives a person who commits sin in this way should be publicly admonished in such a way as to not receive communion until he or she has reformed his life
6099365 if a person who has been admonished persists in public mortal sin and attempts to receive communion the minister of the eucharist has the obligation to deny it to him

6099388 asus has managed add a few nice little tweaks to the card to make it stand out compared to other 9600 gt cards that weve looked at over the past few months the cooler does a good job of keeping the card cool and its also nice to see that the promise of less power comes true with the asus matrix using less power than the reference designed 9600 gt furthermore even with the same clocks the asus card is able to outperform the reference 9600 gt consistently under a number of tests if that wasnt enough for you the fact that asus have then thrown on an optical out port alongside the hdmi one makes the card a perfect choice for people who want something that can do a bit of gaming while giving you the best possible image quality on your home theater pc all in all there isnt a whole lot to complain about with the particular card it would have been nice to see it come to the market a little earlier but like they say better late than never now hopefully we see more graphics cards come in under the republic of gamers naming scheme it will be also interesting to see if we see the matrix naming scheme pop up again in future releases be it from amd or nvidia

6099390 grew concerned about the variation of scriptures from one bible to the next
6099391 flabbergasted to find out this christian publisher had imposed its own opinions upon religious sectors by fraudulently implementing the terminology homosexual to its bible then removed the term from its 1994 holy bible without informing the general public
6099392 know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of god
6099393 do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of god
6099394 surely you know that the people who do wrong will not inherit gods kingdom do not be fooled those who sin sexually worship idols take part in adultery those who are male prostitutes or men who have sexual relations with other men those who steal are greedy get drunk lie about others or rob these people will not inherit gods kingdom

6099406 their median age is about 20 years younger than our median age
6099407 so i dont think we can party as hard as they are now but 20 years ago we could
6099408 we came from a situation where we produced 5 000 kg of corn by hectare while today it is 10 to 12 000 kg per hectare of corn
6099409 we have more chinese people eating we have more indians eating we have more africans eating and we have a lot more brazilians eating
6099410 all this which is treated by the press as if it were a crisis and is sold to the world as if it were a crisis
6099411 without any arrogance or self importance we brazilians need to confront what for others is a crisis as an extraordinary opportunity to truly transform ourselves into the granary of the world as many people have long predicted
6099412 without any doubt there is potential to produce if the government doesnt get in the way
6099413 we are not even going to say help if they dont get in the way a lot year by year the producer is generally increasing production
6099414 if you talk about central brazil there are still a lot of areas to be exploited so i dont have much doubt
6099415 what we have seen in the last 10 years is a quiet revolution happening in our country mostly in agribusiness production
6099416 we came from being an irrelevant international market participant to be one of the worlds major food and biofuel suppliers today
6099417 so if you look at what happened to our agriculture in terms of beef exports poultry exports again we were irrelevant and now we have the position of largest exporter in the world in major food crops
6099418 the impact will start to emerge with more intensity within 20 to 30 years and until then we should be preparing for this
6099419 the perspective for the moment for future harvests is highly productive so brazil has the potential to continue growing around 5 to 6 a year in terms of increasing harvests we are going to effectively maintain this rhythm in the coming years without any problem
6099420 we are not against expanding the brazilian capacity for producing food and helping brazil to develop this country
6099421 you can increase the food capacity through technology through better practices through occupying areas that are already degraded to investing in better crops
6099422 but you can not increase your productivity at the expense of the environment because the global market doesnt accept this price any more
6099423 if we have the right investments coming on for logistics for infrastructure and for technology and land development the country can multiply by two and a half three times the actual production in the next 10 years
6099424 of course we have increases that could come from europe from the usa from canada from argentina
6099425 but where you see the best conditions in order to give the world society the best rate of return in terms of investment is in brazil
6099426 if you talk about the next five years we are now producing 130 million tonnes of grains we can easily go to 250 million tonnes
6099427 we are now producing seven million hectares of sugar cane this can go to 20 million hectares helping to supply ethanol to the world we are only exporting 400m of fruits we can go to 3bn of fruits
6099428 next up is africa i think for africa this could be a redemption in terms of inclusion of people in production systems and making africa produce food and biofuels for the world
6099429 world demand for food today is one billion tonnes and brazil produces 150 million tonnes
6099430 brazil produces 150 million tonnes and the plan launched by the government for more food will produce six million more which is going to leave one million for export how is brazil going to be the granary of food production
6099431 oh my g d that is the coolest person alive

6099436 the way the girls played throughout the tournament gave us a belief that we could have come away with some more wins
6099437 the harsh reality is that its only our second major tournament in four years its a process that we need to go through and were going to be better from this olympics
6099438 trying to get more goals on the board is probably the key in this level of competition
6099439 we were successful at the olympic qualifier against our level of competition where it really counts we need to step up
6099440 you wouldnt believe the e mails weve been getting from young kids at home this has inspired a lot of the younger players
6099441 this team has taken a lot of punches along the way and we continue to get up we have nothing to be ashamed of continuing to play the top teams in the world on a consistent basis is whats going to really continue to develop this team
6099442 you come to the olympics in a big game you need to learn how to win

6099500 in these stories we read about the same events we see in real life and which we ignore and are electrified
6099501 i am not sure if there is an equivalent term in telugu for the word point for the present i would call it lakshyam a story must convey a truth a moral a principle or a hypothesis in the previous century when the story was born its point was either a truth or a moral that means it is only a concept in the mind of the writer then there is the question what about feeling the reader continues to experience the emotions of the characters while reading a story then the question we must ask is whether a story can be written to either invoke a feeling or convey a message exclusively
6099502 i may search her entire life and still find not a single incident worth writing about how can i write a story without anything special in her life or lifestyle
6099503 peddamma has a husband children and the usual events such as childrens weddings and the little tribulations in life the same as everybody else that is a common denominator for almost all people other than that there are no events nothing unusual in her life she has not experienced intense pleasures or unbearable hardships she believes that life is the same for everybody her understanding of life is so narrow
6099504 others may react to her in any number of ways some may be sympathetic to her others may resent her apathy or even be aggravated by it and become philosophical if i could depict all these responses effectively it could turn into a good story
6099505 somebody commented that i did not give a name to the old woman to imply that she is a very ordinary person insignificant in a way i did not think so in fact i did not give names to the other two characters in the story either i agree that names do carry weight in stories but i did not find the need to do so in this story

6099619 major sports media personality tuesday morning at its manhattan headquarters
6099620 when you consider dara torres silver has never shown so brightly at 41 she was older than the combined ages of the gold and bronze medalists in the 50 free and though she couldnt quite catch her she then outswam australias libby trickett in the final leg of the medley relay a true performance for the ages meanwhile regarding her teammate michael phelps the numbers do not lie its beyond dispute hes the most prolific olympic champion ever is he the greatest thats subjective and there are cases to be made for other olympians across eras and across sports suffice it to say its difficult now to put anyone ahead of the 23 year old from baltimore in an age of specialization he swims all four strokes mark spitz as great as he was swam only the butterfly and the freestyle and phelps takes on all comers in a deep international field each one gunning straight for him hes not done yet as he figures to add to his medal haul four years from now in london and in doing so perhaps end the debate all together about this however there is no debate what phelps provided in beijing was more than just sustained excellence he provided the kind of theater that none of us will soon if ever will forget

6099649 showing no fear of the americans the australians delivered hard fouls and attacked the basket instead of settling for jump shots they trailed by just a point after a quarter and five more than halfway through the second and would have been closer if not for missing four easy shots in the half
6099650 i think theyre going to be very very very tough to beat
6099651 im really happy but also a little sad about our result
6099652 we were determined to fight but were limited by our capabilities

6099668 of course i am interested in the future of the club and in helping out if i can
6099669 i am very interested and prepared to listen to any approach
6099670 it is essential the deal went through in hurry because we needed the money
6099671 the directors agreed the transfer fee and manager alan mathews was not consulted
6099672 we needed to bolster the squad particularly with our european aspirations as well as our domestic hopes this season
6099673 we want to do well in all competitions if we went into the campaign with only five recognised defenders in myself zat knight martin laursen nicky shorey and luke young then it would have looked a bit light
6099674 if one got injured theres not much cover carlos has come in and that makes the whole set up look more secure it also provides competition for places which is what any footballer wants it keeps you on your toes
6099675 i know he is scottish player of the year and did well for rangers when they got to the final of the uefa cup you know if the manager pays that sort of money for someone that he will be a good player

6099678 i am just trying to defend properly at the moment doing the bread and butter things getting my head onto things and if the ball needs kicking it goes
6099679 with the railroad came a rough element bringing an alarming increase in drunkenness disorderly behavior and crime ranging from petty thefts to murder and riots a shacktown developed between the tracks and the columbia river dance halls and saloons flourished in 1908 mayor john gellatly issued an ineffective order that all prostitutes leave the city or reform
6099680 more successful was an anti saloon movement that had been building for years among the more respectable citizenry in 1909 the state legislature had approved a local option law whereby communities could decide whether to go dry or wet no one championed the anti saloon position more ardently than rufus woods and his newspaper wenatchee went dry in august 1909 but the saloonkeepers and their customers challenged the decision in 1910 and 1912 they lost both times wenatchees dry crusade was so successful that committees from other communities sought the advice of mayor gellatly on how to achieve a dry local option
6099681 in 1915 the john a gellatly residence along okanogan avenue was acquired by the methodist episcopal church and became the first deaconess hospital a 50 bed three story addition was dedicated in 1923 and the former gellatly residence became a nurses home and training school additional wings were added in 1948 and 1963 the hospital closed in 1978
6099682 the more cynical observers attributed the large field of prominent names in this contest to the historic fact that no washington governor had yet lived to complete a second term
6099683 while lieutenant governor mr gellatly aided by senator jake miller saved the wenatchee areas reclamation districts such as manson wenatchee heights and stemilt hill and others stevens pass was included in the states highway system principally through the efforts of gellatly and miller
6099684 was complicated by the fact that he was afraid to leave the state lest gellatly as acting governor should marshal the forces of opposition and do him in in his absence
6099685 i am not disturbed by his fulminations they prove that hartley fears me and is making desperate efforts to weaken my candidacy before the primary what hartley says has no effect it is the same old stuff the people have heard for eight years he merely shows that he is frightened
6099686 as a result of the primary election last week the next executive of this state is sure to be a man of dignity and integrity
6099687 roland h hartley republican governor for the last eight years was defeated for renomination by easygoing colorless lieut governor john a gellatly
6099688 many of hartleys appointees turned to martin after the primary because they were convinced that gellatly would replace them whereas martin might retain them if they supported him in the general election gellatly was caught between two fires on one hand he could not boldly declare that he would dismiss all the employees who owed their jobs to hartley for fear of losing their votes on the other hand nothing less than wholesale removals would satisfy anti hartley republicans gellatly was not able to solve the problem and even hartley went out of his way to encourage people to vote for martin republicans who supported the governor in the primary afterward retained control of some county central committees and forced gellatly to work outside the party structure in conducting his campaign during the general election
6099689 but if your friend should withdraw from the race may i not then count on your support
6099690 have just perused your editorial entitled mccarthy cries again and while we may have to admit that mccarthy has been somewhat lacking in tact in his effort to rid our government of reds and pinks he obviously would have gotten nowhere had he not used some glass breaking methods the fact is indisputable that he has done more to arouse the american people about the subversive influences extant in the very core of our government and to scare the very devil out of scores of questionable risks than all the halfhearted investigations conducted by sundry congressional committees put together

6099733 theres an old saying that if your neighbors are losing their jobs its a recession if yu are losing yours its a depression its therefore unfortunate that such a large fraction of prominent forecasters hails from the financial community their views are colored by the turmoil suffered in their industry in an earlier generation many of the best known forecasters ran economics departments in nonfinancial companies today these are a dying breed thanks to the past decades of corporate cost cutting we are not a nation of whiners but we do have a lot of alarmists it is becoming politically incorrect to suggest that the economy is basically sound we shouldnt expect forecasters to shrug off the depressing effects of whats happening in their own back yards this is human nature we just need to keep things in perspective when we listen to them a more objective diagnosis is especially needed during an election year in which many unfounded fears are broadcast and amplified by the media
6099734 the most painful and frustrating economic policy blunder of the past 50 years was the great inflation of the 1970s painful because it was the catalyst for three damaging recessions 1973 75 1980 1981 82 all the while eroding living standards and seriously undermining confidence in america it was also deeply frustrating despite the teaching of milton friedman which clearly explained that inflation was caused by too much money chasing too few goods a combination of bad economic models denial and political expediency allowed it to happen president reagan meets with paul volcker chairman of the federal reserve board 1981 one would think that the odds of a repeat were low and for 20 years after ronald reagan and his fed chairman paul volcker had the courage to get inflation under control with tight money and tax cuts this was true unfortunately the lessons seem to be fading today the u s and through it the world faces its greatest threat from inflation in 30 years and as in the past this threat is being met with denial and political expediency
6099735 as is so often the case after the fed has acted but before the typical lag in monetary policy has fully played out conventional wisdom argues that the fed has become impotent
6099736 with the real or inflation adjusted federal funds rate now negative the signals are clear the fed is still adding more money to the system than is demanded and this suggests that the general increase in inflationary pressures will continue the only question is whether policy makers will get the courage to fight inflation before it gets out of control and this is the rub much like the 1970s there is a widespread denial that inflation is a problem today some argue that fed policy is not easy either because the money supply is not growing or that banks are deleveraging which counteracts any attempt by the fed to inject money the first argument hits at the root of friedmans monetary theory if money is not growing then how can inflation be a problem but money is growing no measure of money is declining despite bank deleveraging and reserve bank credit the feds balance sheet has expanded at a 14 4 annual rate in the past three months another sign of easy money is that every country that pegs to the dollar including china and the united arab emirates is experiencing a rapid acceleration in its inflation rates as it imports inflationary u s monetary policy the second argument is belied by history between 1983 and 1994 exactly 2 747 u s banks and s amp ls failed representing total assets of 894 billion during that period of deleveraging real gdp in the u s expanded at an annual average of 3 5 the great depression is the only period of sharp economic contraction in the u s correlated with bank failures but that was clearly related to a deflationary mistake in fed policy real interest rates were outrageously high in the late 1920s and much of the 30s which is not true today
6099737 one of the reasons that monetary policy is so loose today is that our economy is addicted once again to easy money and low interest rates we hear over and over that the fed cannot tighten because the housing market and the economy are vulnerable this was the same argument made in the pre volcker 1970s when the u s bounced from one economic crisis to the next but a look back at the past 40 years clearly shows that the economy was much healthier in the 1980s and 90s when real interest rates were high rather than low as they were in the 1960s and 70s
6099738 democracy won today the integrity of the vote was upheld the separation of powers stands for something the city council cant be prosecutor judge and jury

6099740 we needed to bolster the squad particularly with our european aspirations as well as our domestic hopes this season
6099741 we want to do well in all competitions if we went into the campaign with only five recognised defenders in myself zat knight martin laursen nicky shorey and luke young then it would have looked a bit light
6099742 if one got injured theres not much cover carlos has come in and that makes the whole set up look more secure it also provides competition for places which is what any footballer wants it keeps you on your toes
6099743 i know he is scottish player of the year and did well for rangers when they got to the final of the uefa cup you know if the manager pays that sort of money for someone that he will be a good player

6099745 theres more to come from curtis davies in essence i am still finding my feet a bit
6099746 i am just trying to defend properly at the moment doing the bread and butter things getting my head onto things and if the ball needs kicking it goes

6099755 this is the first picture of a clay sized particle on mars and the size agrees with predictions from the colors seen in sunsets on the red planet
6099756 taking this image required the highest resolution microscope operated off earth and a specially designed substrate to hold the martian dust
6099757 we always knew it was going to be technically very challenging to image particles this small
6099758 im delighted that this microscope is producing images that will help us understand mars at the highest detail ever
6099759 this is proof of the microscopes potential we are now ready to start doing scientific experiments that will add a new dimension to measurements being made by other phoenix lander instruments
6099760 after this first success were now working on building up a portrait gallery of the dust on mars

6099827 its not reasonable to teach our girls that they have to take care to make sure men dont interpret any sexual signal from them what does that do i mean thats crazy some men need very little just being a woman is enough for some guys and then what they dress modestly act appropriately and some guy still hits on them then theyre thinking its their fault thats really a terrible message and its not at all the angle and approach i want to take here i want them to think that they can have their own style and be safe and if for some reason some man cant respect that then its his problem i want them to know they have the right to say no and the right to move on i pray mothers and fathers of sons are out there teaching their boys the same thing but a big part of that is language and that means being thoughtful about how we speak about other people how theyre dressed in front of and to our kids

6099885 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6099886 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6099887 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6099888 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
6099889 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6099890 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6099891 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6099892 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6099893 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6099894 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6099895 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6099896 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6099897 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6099898 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6099899 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6099900 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6099901 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6099902 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6099903 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6099904 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6099905 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6099906 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6099907 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6099908 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6099909 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6099910 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6099911 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6099912 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6099913 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6099914 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6099915 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6099916 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6099917 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6099918 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6099919 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6099920 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6099921 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6099922 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6099923 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6099924 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6099925 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6099926 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6099927 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6099928 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6099929 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6099930 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6099931 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6099932 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6099933 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6099934 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6099935 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6099936 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6099937 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6099938 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6099939 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6099940 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6099941 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6099942 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6099943 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6099944 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6099945 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6099946 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6099947 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6099948 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6099949 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6099950 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6099951 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6099952 this is a great result for the company given the current global market conditions it is testimony to our business model and the continued uptake by leading global companies who recognize that best practice succession planning and talent management has changed for ever
6099953 companies need to be on the front foot when it comes to managing the various components of leadership risk to achieve true competitive advantage and not take a just in time reactive approach
6099954 we would like to think of our new website as an extension of what we started nearly 15 years ago at ebi we have always been about solid performance meticulous client service industry education and a shared commitment to the highest level of integrity in everything we do we believe that our new website is a reflection of our core values and it will provide our clients with everything that they will need to make their life easier

6099956 the nations highest recognition of the art of humor writing
6099957 with tax and tip it slightly breaks the ml price cap but the burger was pretty big and delicious and the beer was checker cab blond ale which is at the very least better than bud light they sneakily charged another 1 50 for cheese but its still a damn good deal and they have pepper jack
6099958 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6099959 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6099960 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6099961 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6099962 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6099963 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6099964 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6099965 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6099966 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6099967 who are open to doing something on the production side
6099968 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6099969 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6099970 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6099971 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6099972 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6099973 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6099974 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6099975 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

6099986 the models tested here confirmed that the health of individual employees and in particular their mental health is a key contributor to productivity loss
6099987 but these models also attest to how other factors measured by a comprehensive hra like the wellness checkpoint contribute to both impaired performance while at work and time away from work these factors exert their influence on productivity loss that are both independent of health and are considerable in their magnitude above and beyond the contribution of health
6099988 the result in this study is a wealth of information that can be used for shaping and guiding efforts to reduce productivity loss this information can help to build the rationale and consensus for taking action
6099989 health is not the only accessible and measurable candidate for intervention efforts
6099990 the models presented in the joem article provide an important framework for our clients to consider group data for their employee and business groups in developing strategies for managing disability return to work programs identifying risk exposures and making informed program decisions that can impact the health of their employees and their organizations
