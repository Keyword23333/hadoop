2870007 there certainly is a level of isi complicity in the militant areas in pakistan and organisations such as the taliban
2870008 i cant say to what level of leadership that goes to but there are indications of complicity on the part of isi to the extent that they are facilitating these militant groups that come out of the tribal areas in pakistan
2870009 unfortunately we see a higher number of non pashtun non afghanistan fighters this year than this time last year
2870010 they are really from a variety of ethnic groupings some are from areas in pakistan some are from places like uzbekistan or chechnya some are from europe and some are from other arab countries
2870011 but when you have a problem of porous borders and fighters and weapons and resources and command and control and logistics being brought in from outside of afghanistan that adds a complicating context to the insurgency
2870012 we come with militaries that have advantages in command and control in speed in lethality in logistics in intelligence in all those things
2870013 if nations provide forces with restrictions what it does is it decreases those advantages
2870014 how fast we can get there i dont know but it is important that the international community remain committed to afghanistan

2870034 we can only bring the ideal of how sport can bring people together it is a very complex issue and it is not for the ioc to give a perspective on what has been happening
2870035 it is not what the world wants to see it is contrary to what the olympic ideal stands for the sad reality is that there are a number of countries at the olympics that are in conflict
2870036 given the current uncertainties caused by the global credit crisis and the unknown of when confidence will re emerge in the some sections of the financial market we are not going to provide specific guidance at this time
2870037 however the board and management are confident we will see further solid improvement in profit and shareholder return in 2009 even if the current market conditions prevail
2870038 that is we have opportunities that are quite compelling for us to put our energy and efforts into to make sure we can generate value just as we have in the last ten months
2870039 we are also taking the opportunity afforded by the current disruption to wholesale markets to reshape those businesses for growth and improved margins once funding begins to flow again

2870050 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2870051 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2870052 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2870053 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2870054 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2870055 this is positive to the market in the short term but westill have to keep an eye on how this story will end finally
2870056 it will jump at the openning trade but it might not gofar beyond 705 points
2870057 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2870058 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2870059 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2870065 my recruitment has gone really well so far i have a lot of options but i want to get out and see a few more schools before i make my final decision
2870066 he told me that they really want me to play middle linebacker in his system
2870067 after the trip alabama is on the top of my list right now and wisconsin is probably second i still have to check out ohio state and see what it is like
2870068 what intrigues me most about alabama is the fact that everyone on the entire staff has a winning attitude and i feel very comfortable around them
2870069 im really looking for a program and a place that i feel comfortable with however the most important thing is to be at a place that i think is going to win a national championship
2870070 right now i am just taking things one step at a time i am really thinking about everything and going over it with my parents to see what they think i dont think i will be deciding in the near future i would say the early fall would be more likely
2870071 of course christ is the truth and only he has words of eternal life
2870072 so far i have offers southern california miami alabama maryland unc nc state clemson and south carolina
2870073 as it stands right now i do not have any favorites im wide open
2870074 to tell you the truth the thing i really want is to go to a school with great academics
2870075 i also want to go to a school where there is a brotherhood amongst the players the coaches and the people all around you i want it go to a place that is like one big family i think this is important because when their are hard times along the way they will go by easier and we will all be working hard towards one main goal a championship
2870076 i think that alabama has a really solid program to be attracting so many people to a spring game
2870077 montgomery received an offer over the past month from coach saban and has continued to receive interest from alabama and other schools as well
2870078 my coach tells me that alabama has a really strong program
2870079 with those two things being said if you have the respect of coach saban and you see they had the top recruiting class in the nation i think it is worth taking a good look and seeing what they have to offer
2870080 ive picked up some recent offers i got an offer from georgia oklahoma miami and west virginia recently all of these schools have offered me within the past few weeks
2870081 the recruiting class as a whole really doesnt have a big effect on me at all
2870082 im happy for alabama especially coach saban and coach thompson likewise im happy for alabama fans hopefully alabama will get back on track to winning national championships like they used to do
2870083 im not focusing on one thing really my main focus is to help my other teams out i play three sports and i really dont take a day off the entire year
2870084 when coaches come down and talk i will talk to them but other than that i am so busy that i leave a lot of that up to my parents and my coaches right now
2870085 the dedication of the fans and their turnout for the a day game is great for the program
2870086 i like oklahoma alabama lsu miami and georgia they are my five favorites right now
2870087 i love the coaching staff to me i think they have the best assistants in the nation they have the best mix with a couple older coaches and a few younger ones that you could possibly have on your staff coach pendry is really fun to be around because of his sense of humor and coach thompson is awesome hes an older guy but hes just like a younger guy he reminds me a lot of my father i have a blast when i go up there
2870088 alabama has not given me an offer yet but i can only imagine what it would be like to play for alabama it would be awesome
2870089 i am looking for a school that fits me best not anyone else i want to attend a school that knows how to win and can get me to be the best i can be in the classroom and on the field as well unlike many other early playing time is not something i see as a necessity but i do want to play as soon as i can it just depends on what plays out
2870090 i said wait a minute the community doesnt even know anything about it
2870091 we were sold down the river before anybody even knew what this thing was
2870092 it appears that the undersecretary responsible for this program may have corrupted the site selection process by putting his thumb on the scale in favor of a particular site and its contractor in violation of his own rules and over the objections of his own advisers

2870099 youve heard it said in days of old thou shalt not commit adultery but i say to you whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart
2870100 by your own admission youre a lying theif and an adulterer at heart and weve only looked at 3 of the 10 commandments so far
2870101 i call on the authorities of azerbaijan to stop fabricating cases against journalists criticizing them
2870102 campaign held by azerbaijani tv channels against azadlyg newspaper correspondent is inadmissible in civilian countries
2870103 i call on the authorities of azerbaijan to stop fabricating cases against journalists criticizing them
2870104 i call on the azerbaijani authorities to stop fabricating cases against journalists criticizing them
2870105 in fact the police and prosecutors office must protect journalists moreover i ask president of azerbaijan ilham aliyev to pardon the imprisoned reporters regardless of whether they addressed to him or no i would also like to thank the president for pardoning most imprisoned journalists
2870106 we armenians are not very good at showing our grief to the world
2870107 as of april 10 1992 there were more than 3 000 people living in maragha currently only 300 people who have survived the massacres live in the nor maragha village in other words more than 2 and a half thousand people are living abroad and dont have the opportunity to come back to their homeland the maragha village is currently under the control of azerbaijani armed forces as well as the villages of margushavan karmiravan seysula etc the karabagh authorities have stated that the karabagh conflict resolution must include karabaghs territorial integrity especially the northern section of the martakert region which has been the region with the most agriculture and one of the most developed substructures of the republic as a result of the tragic events in maragha and the war in progress five wine factories nearly 30 000 vineyards have been destroyed and the mother water route of karabagh has also been ruined
2870108 we must be ready to present the facts to the international community not as a counterattack to azerbaijans anti propaganda but so that the international community will know who when and how were the people massacred and who was it that decided to took advantage of the war in order to organize ethnic cleansing azerbaijan has led this kind of politics for years through peace when karabagh was still located in azerbaijan as an autonomous region this politics reached the climax in 1991 when azerbaijan let go of the opportunity to solve matters peacefully with the people of karabagh and declared a war on karabagh so the attacks on the border shouldnt be looked at as the result of the politics led by the karabagh authorities but rather as the result of azerbaijans aggression and keeping the people of karabagh under foreign control as a means of defending the country if we have the studies conducted by the national assembly temporary committee we can then present them to the international community and start the propaganda so that the international community also knows about karabaghs national liberation struggle basically the fact that the karabagh conflict may be an honor for azerbaijan while it is a question of survival on the homeland for the people of karabagh
2870109 i dont think that we have the chance today to bring the perpetrators to justice but if we are going towards international recognition of karabaghs independence then we must start raising the issue by announcing the names of the perpetrators one by one especially since its no secret to anyone
2870110 i call on the authorities of azerbaijan to stop fabricating cases against journalists criticizing them
2870111 campaign held by azerbaijani tv channels against azadlyg newspaper correspondent is inadmissible in civilian countries
2870112 the tv channels not only agreed to demonstrate a film worked out by a single center but they did not just checked the facts did not present the opinion of the opposite side i call on these tv channels to stop the campaign this is illegal and nothing of the kind can occur in the countries where law is supreme during my meeting with general prosecutor zakir garalov he said that the film was demonstrated upon his demand and the criminal admitted his guilt
2870113 after that halil was pursued by civilians and several days after it he was attacked i met with halils parents and they announced that senior inspector ali guliyev met them and put three provisions halil was to announce that he was stabbed by one of his colleagues in the zadlyg newspaper or by himself or withdraw his claim for a definite amount otherwise the inspector noted that tv channels will demonstrate video about his relations with queer people
2870114 i call on zakir garalov to undertake measures for the resolution of this problem for instituting criminal investigation regarding the principle of immunity of personal life and investigate the case of inspector who put forward the provisions to halils family
2870115 head of presidential administration ramiz mehtiyev and foreign minister elmar mamedyarov expressed their understanding during the meeting with me regarding the negative situation however i did not see the same understanding during the meeting with zakir garalov
2870116 campaign held by azerbaijani tv channels against azadlyg newspaper correspondent is inadmissible in civilian countries
2870117 i was unable to feed my family with the measly pay i was getting as a chemistry teacher
2870118 my wife is a music teacher i have two school age children and my old mother also depends on me so i had to find some kind of construction work even though i graduated with honours from a teaching college
2870119 but the work is really hard such as digging ground at someones dacha or hauling heavy things
2870120 the odd job market picks up in spring when the dacha season begins and people need a lot of cheap labour
2870121 it goes into recession in autumn and dies in winter
2870122 there are nine of us here all with university degrees
2870123 there are hordes of people looking for odd jobs and clients are few and far between sometimes you hang around for a whole day and still bring nothing home
2870124 there are worse things than an empty wallet to lose your hope of a better life is far more terrible
2870125 my school friend was once a successful biologist he couldnt find work for seven years and was forced to live off his wife and elder brother until i got him a job as a gardener for a businessmans family he hanged himself two years ago his note said i cant live like this anymore he was 39 years old
2870126 actually there is one thing i remember after all these years
2870127 when we rolled into motherfucking we could not find our motel because we were too shitfaced so we just parked our bikes in a parking lot and passed out until the cops woke us up the next morning
2870128 hey i do remember that too we passed out half a block from the cop shop the fucking cops were asking us if we had rolled into their redneck town to meet up with the grim reapers at the bike show they figured our packs were full of dope but they could not think of a good reason to search us that morning
2870129 when you expect the worst out of people it is surprising how often you are right on the fucking money
2870130 i think they were ready to roust us anyway until one of the fat fuckers spotted the portrait of anne murray you had painted on your tank he scratched his head so hard after he saw that his skull started bleeding
2870131 some people put their faith in the virgin mary i put mine in canadas sweetheart
2870132 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
2870133 we really felt the loss as one of our own
2870134 maybe thats why it hurts so much it hit so close
2870135 in volleyball if you let up the other team takes advantage
2870136 the best we can honor them is to go out and play hard
2870137 the toll of asbestos related cancer first noticed in the 1950s and 1960s is likely to continue for several more decades even though usage reduced rapidly some 25 years ago while there are reasons to suppose that nanotubes can be used safely this will depend on appropriate steps being taken to prevent them from being inhaled in the places they are manufactured used and ultimately disposed of such steps should be based on research into exposure and risk prevention leading to regulation of their use following this study the results of which were foreseen by the royal society in the u k in 2004 we can no longer delay investing in such research
2870138 the results were clear long thin carbon nanotubes showed the same effects as long thin asbestos fibers short or curly carbon nanotubes did not behave like asbestos and by knowing the possible dangers of long thin carbon nanotubes we can work to control them its a good news story not a bad one it shows that carbon nanotubes and their products could be made to be safe

2870140 by our mockeries and our attacks upon them we shall make their priests ridiculous then odious and then their religion as ridiculous and as odious as their clergy
2870141 there must be no let up in the war against religion because as long as religions exist communism cannot prevail we must intensify the destruction of all religions wherever they are being practised and taught

2870153 i tried to put a good solid swing to the middle of the 16th green and hopefully it goes there if it drifts a little bit perfect but i came out of the swing just a touch and just went in the water
2870154 but then i hit a great putt on 17 i dont know why it didnt break i feel like i hit a good putt i hit it left edge and it just didnt break and it lipped out on the left and then 18s just a tough hole
2870155 i felt like i responded well and padraig harrington was obviously very good on the back nine and things just happened his way
2870156 ive said it before there are guys that get a little bit fortunate they get in contention in a major and manage to get things going their way either because they play well or because somebody else comes back
2870157 and unfortunately it hasnt happened to me i feel like i played well enough to win probably more than two majors throughout my career
2870158 lets put the past behind us and build the future that was a political issue and we took responsibility by paying compensation for the burning of the embassy
2870159 now we provide a guarantee to thai investors in order to make them more confident
2870160 yes investing in cambodia is risky and we knew that before we even decided to put our money in the country the first time around
2870161 all i want to say is if the country wants to see funds flow into the country it will have to avoid look at ways to avoid creating a situation where investors start to fear
2870162 the impact we have had is very minimal as the business size that we have there is very small and it is our firms policy to not invest too much in any single country that is new to us
2870163 i must say that we are used to these kinds of downturns as we have experienced them in burma too what we do is we wait and see how things shape up and then make a decision
2870164 they usually last for a short period and things go back to normal
2870165 yes there are risks and we knew it after the 2003 incident but cambodia is a market where everything is basically imported and how many markets in this part of the world can you find where there is such a huge potential
2870166 what we have to look at long term potential and overlook the short term issues
2870167 today despite all the perceived problems we are not experiencing anything there but then our project is not for mass consumption either and it would take years before we start to realise our returns
2870168 truk mbok ya jangan dipindah pindah gitu pilh salah satu dan kita tonton rame rame

2870180 there are times when a single project in china can equal the entire size of the indian carbon trade market
2870181 developers probably got more projects launch ready by end june encouraged by the recent response at show flats
2870182 for the next one to two quarters we could see the stock coming down if take up remains encouraging in turn the encouraging sales may also spur other developers to get projects launch ready and that could again add to the pool of yet to be launched units
2870183 no consistent pattern of a downward adjustment in prices of new launches
2870184 the differential between the prices contracted in june and in may or april could be attributed to adjustments for floor height and orientation however in line with the flash estimates we expect only a marginal upside in residential prices in the second quarter
2870185 as developers are increasingly forgoing aggressive pricing strategy in favour of competitive pricing strategy cumulatively this will result in a softening in price level for the general market
2870186 we are looking forward to this seminar and we hope to have a strong presence of the business community to strengthen the trade relationship between both countries

2870267 our nation has undergone more than 80 years of this humiliation
2870268 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2870269 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2870270 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2870271 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2870272 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2870273 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2870274 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2870275 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2870290 our assessment is that the rba is likely to indicate increasing downside risks to its growth forecasts and increased confidence that inflation will fall which will help reinforce expectations for interest rate cuts in the months ahead albeit maybe not to the same degree as that already priced into the money markets
2870291 all sectors including resources which have been hit by rising costs are likely to report soft results for 2007 08
2870292 however while the results are unlikely to be the disaster the market is currently priced for after its 30 slump from last years high the focus is likely to be on the outlook statements from companies and these are likely to be disappointing
2870293 while market expectations for 60 growth from resources in 2008 09 are reasonable given the latest surge in coal and iron ore prices consensus expectations for 5 to 10 growth in the rest of the market are likely way too strong and will be revised down
2870294 the commonwealth banks result will likely be a key focus given the increase in debt provisioning at nab and anz recently

2870306 i am pleased that the hard work and commitment of our global team is being reflected in our financial results
2870307 lower than expected sales in both north america and europe driven by softness in non residential construction and general economic weakness and rising raw material and fuel costs have caused us to reduce our outlook for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2008
2870308 during the quarter we also lowered our outlook for geesink due to a slower and more difficult than expected return to profitability coupled with expectations of a weaker european economy and higher raw materials costs this revised outlook has caused us to believe that the value of geesink no longer supports the goodwill recorded for this business resulting in the impairment charge we are announcing today
2870309 arvinmeritors favorable product customer and geographic mix combined with a dedicated focus across the company to implement and maintain cost reduction initiatives drove strong results this quarter

2870313 democrats will win elections when they figure out how to talk to those families

2870319 the truth or falsity of moral judgments or their justification is not absolute or universal but is relative to the traditions convictions or practices of a group of persons
2870320 however much we dislike it we are again and again forced to recognise that there are no truly absolute values whatever not even human life itself
2870321 the conservative is generally happy to cling to his belief in absolute values while i envy him i cannot share his beliefs
2870322 a hallmark of a genuinely liberal non utopian cast of mind

2870357 standing alone an american womans struggle for the soul of islam
2870358 disturbs us that we feel we cannot publish it right now
2870359 from credible and unrelated sources cautionary advice not only that the publication of this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
2870360 this saga upsets me as a muslim and as a writer who believes that fiction can bring islamic history to life in a uniquely captivating and humanizing way
2870361 mint has a handful of american citizens in its newsroom including me
2870362 india is a fascinating country where history is being made in many respects so it is a fertile place for good journalism hopefully some of the non indian journalists will have a better understanding of india when they do go back
2870363 after spending several months in dharamsala teaching children with special needs i realized the lack of formal education available to this population not only in dharamsala but throughout india and the developing world
2870364 we already have a waiting list at the dharamsala school and are working hard to ensure we can accommodate of all the special needs students in the area in the near future
2870365 you are a union that is proud of achieving a muslim holiday and prayer room
2870366 a union in the u s a a country based on christianity you call yourselves americans have you forgotten 9 11
2870367 you had no right to drop labor day muslim employees must integrate labor day into their lives if they are going to live in america

2870376 both mccain and obama are making very scary statements obama for one sometimes hes even more hawkish than mccain about pakistan he feels all the terrorism is based in the tribal areas and saying hes going to increase troops in pakistan and mccain is scary because he feels bushs policies were fine neither one of them make us comfortable
2870377 there was an interesting survey that recently came out from the rand corporation it said in the last 40 years of terrorism only 8 was solved by military action so i hope he obama realizes that pakistan could become another cambodia it could face a similar situation if they push the pakistani army into the tribal areas and if they go pakistan could face destabilization
2870378 its a much larger role who runs pakistan is it a small ruling elite or is it the 160 million people of pakistan the head of the isi who conducted the 2002 elections who was actually distributing seats asked me and it was simple if you are on musharrafs side then you get this many seats so this is the biggest problem preventing pakistan from moving past corruption
2870379 in the 1980s 4 of the gdp was spent on education now its down to 1 7 we are among the five countries which have spent the least on education the rest are in africa no one asks why are you sending your kids to madrassas you have a proliferation of madraassas because its the only schooling kids get they have no other option therefore im trying to change that im trying to set up the first ever knowledge city the idea is to invite people from the private sector to make a future oxford
2870380 i get asked all the time why did you need to be in politics and i say i think what we need are people who dont need politics we need people who are going to bring about a change
2870381 a great leader is never controlled by anyone only their vision they lead by example mobilize the people and lead them to believe in that same vision which is a common vision for the people

2870484 we must continually emphasize the fact that the way we shall live in the spiritual world after death will depend entirely on the manner in which we have lived here on upon earth social life with other human beings in the spiritual world will also depend on the kind of relationship we have tried to form with them here in the other world we cannot without more ado make a connection with a person with whom we had no connection here the possibility of being brought to him of being with him in the spiritual world is acquired as a rule through the connections made here on earth not however merely through those made in the last incarnation but also in former ones in short actual and personal relationships which we have had on earth determine our life between death and rebirth
2870485 in the spiritual world between death and rebirth we are among purely spiritual beings partly with those whose whole existence is in the spiritual world and partly with the souls of men who have cast off their earthly bodies and taken on spiritual ones or with those souls who are awaiting their coming redescent to earth this depends somehwat on whether we have formed a bond with such souls in earthly life

2870494 coming through turns 3 and 4 and watching helio run out of fuel with a few hundred feet to go was pretty special i must say its nice to be in that position
2870495 obviously a 78 point lead is pretty healthy but were going to have to still try to gain points on helio

2870542 i did not say anything i was always embarassed by the words sacred glorious and sacrifice and the expression in vain we had heard them sometimes standing in the rain almost out of earshot so that only the shouted words came through and had read them on proclamations that were slapped up by billposters over other proclamations now for a long time and i had seen nothing sacred and the things that were glorious had no glory and the sacrifices were like the stockyards at chicago if nothing was done with the meat except to bury it there were many words that you could not stand to hear and finally only the names of places had dignity certain numbers were the same way and certain dates and these with the names of the places were all you could say and have them mean anything abstract words such as glory honor courage or hallow were obscene beside the concrete names of villages the numbers of roads the names of rivers the numbers of regiments and the dates gino was a patriot so he said things that seperated us sometimes but he was also a fine boy and i understood his being a patriot he was born one he left with peduzzi in the car to go back to gorizia

2870606 id like to see more welsh groups there but maybe we are too ready to stand back and not put our case forward
2870607 what is needed in this area is proper year round jobs to keep people here
2870608 i think its a pity more events arent put on which are based on the welsh language
2870609 we should be concentrating on being positive and making the most of what we have
2870610 there has been a lack of marketing in the past but we should get together and do it ourselves
2870611 there is no way heavy industry would be allowed to come here as its a conservation area
2870612 i get comments from people saying things like i could be anywhere and i havent heard any welsh being spoken
2870613 yoga offers a combination of physical exercise with mental focus that may make it a suitable therapy for the treatment of low back pain
2870614 if the trial shows yoga to be effective then this low cost treatment will have a considerable impact in the quality of life of patients with back pain
2870615 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful
2870616 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it
2870617 its a little bit ugly i started in december to try and improve my flexibility in preparation for the australian open
2870618 it has helped me a lot with my fitness and my mental strength because its tough being in that kind of heat for that length of time
2870619 in the heat your body is able to go that little bit further because the muscles get so warm
2870620 many of the welsh people i have taught have told me that although yoga is important to them so is their own language and culture
2870621 ive always felt very close to dragons and the dragon mythology so i used a story in the abergavenny festival about a dragon in a routine similar to the salutation to the sun a traditional yoga sequence which one of my pupils translated for me
2870622 i asked the class to imagine being asleep in a cave then becoming aware of talons nostrils and scales
2870623 warming up we got our wings stretched and flapping then we went on a flight
2870624 i was over the moon with the reaction one woman who has been doing yoga for 30 years and has recently returned to wales said she felt reconnected with her welshness
2870625 ive been a tutor for 20 years and am entrenched in eastern culture hindu and buddhist thought but its not my culture
2870626 compared to the rest of the country in the national league tables leicester is in the bottom quartile
2870627 we have to bring this level down because of the cost the effect its having on those staff who are working hard and to improve the services for the citizens of leicester
2870628 the last few years have been quite traumatic within the council with so many reviews so many changes and savings that have been made on frontline services its not surprising that the morale and the stress levels are high
2870629 et maintenant si vous avez un tout ptit peu de c ur vous me mettez des photos dossier sur vos blogs pour me remonter le moral mon tour parce que a va pas fort depuis que jai percut que jaurai pas de vacances avant septembre 2009

2870631 were talking about kids pretending to be animals and doing exercise routines to rhymes there is nothing that could damage their minds
2870632 i thought the church hall would be ideal and i told them i wanted to use it for a childrens activity
2870633 but when i came to book it i told the woman from the church office it was for baby yoga and she went all strange
2870634 i got a letter from the minister a few days later saying i couldnt have the hall with no reasons given
2870635 i rang the church office and the woman said it was because yoga was related to a spirituality unrelated to christian spirituality which is ridiculous
2870636 un jour quelquun a tent de mexpliquer la pourriture noble en passant dans les vignes de monbazillac vin que jaime la folie mais javoue ne pas avoir tout bien retenu
2870637 they are not concerned with the mind they are only going to shown you the jumping up and down
2870638 with the greatest respect to swami ive taken something from it because its improved my posture
2870639 yoga is for those people who can live away from the world

2870646 our family has been through a lot some caused by nature some caused by human weakness and some most recently caused by the desire for sensationalism and profit without any regard for the human consequences none of these has been easy but we have stood with one another through them all although john believes he should stand alone and take the consequences of his action now when the door closes behind him he has his family waiting for him john made a terrible mistake in 2006 the fact that it is a mistake that many others have made before him did not make it any easier for me to hear when he told me what he had done but he did tell me and we began a long and painful process in 2006 a process oddly made somewhat easier with my diagnosis in march of 2007 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private the pain of the long journey since 2006 was about to be renewed john has spoken in a long on camera interview admitting ones mistakes is a hard thing for anyone to do i am proud of the courage john showed by his honesty in the face of shame the toll on our family of news helicopters over our house and reporters in our driveway is yet unknown but now the truth is out and the repair work that began in 2006 will continue i ask that the public who expressed concern about the harm johns conduct has done to us think also about the real harm that the present voyeurism does and give me and my family the privacy we need at this time
2870647 we have developed and adopted a strategic plan on national reproductive health a national health promotion policy and five year plan including a national orphanage guidelines in improving infrastructure we aim at operationalizing some 550 health facilities as compared with the current 354 however more needs to be done as we continue to face challenges in reversing the high maternal mortality and morbidity in liberia our human resource development goals seek to train doctors and nurses and health care workers at improved national training institutions we ask them to make the sacrifice of service but we know that we need to compensate them commensurate with the sacrifice we require of them
2870648 our citizens should not have to choose between dying and receiving medical care
2870649 commit ourselves to create the environment at all levels of our national health system to support and promote maternal and neonatal health provide professionals for all of our rural health services at all levels of our health delivery system make quality health care services available and accessible to all pregnant women build relationships across our national health system to enhance networking among communities throughout the country and improve healthcare delivery to all women
2870650 we must match our works and enthusiasm with concrete actions improving maternal health and achieving the rest of the millenniums development goals may elude us if we both weak and strong nations do not collaborate to rescue the most important pillars of our human society our mothers our sisters our daughters our nieces in the developing world their very survival is threatened and we need to take action to save them
2870651 my boyfriend and i were walking along singapore river this evening and while trying to take a nice picture of alkaff bridge we noticed someone swimming or what seemed like a nice bath in the river
2870652 there was another guy holding a towel waiting for the swimming guy to finish
2870653 the guy caucasian came out of the water and started to parade naked while the other guy tried frantically to cover his private parts with the towel and he started to wear his jeans in the open without his underwear apparently
2870654 45 minutes later when walking back to robertson quay we saw two policemen questioning the said caucasian hes now wearing jeans and a red t shirt with no shoes and the other guy who was with him
2870655 i wont go to rangiora now people have only heard one side of the story they dont know what ive put into it i wont even go and do my grocery shopping

2870667 shredded newspaper business models that had held sway for decades
2870668 the decision to explore a sale was painful but a sale may be the best opportunity for the long term survival of our newspapers in washington and those in maine
2870669 we have been proud to be the stewards of these newspapers for the last 10 years they provide their community with high quality independent journalism that is in keeping with the best traditions of the seattle times company
2870670 we wish our stewardship could continue indefinitely but the difficult business environment and continuing uncertainties require we consider other options
2870671 workers here are stunned by the news we can understand why the blethen family is selling its maine properties but the news was still unexpected a lot of employees are apprehensive right now
2870672 theyve been hit hard financially and have had to take some strategic and tactical measures in recent years to keep the ships afloat
2870673 now theyve made the decision apparently to cut back on the number of ships they have in the water
2870674 no other industry kicks itself in the rear end more than newspapers nobody else even comes close tv and radio would never do that newspapers magnify their own problems to their audience we dont talk about the good things the conversion from print to online at newspapers is the envy of radio and tv
2870675 giving ourselves a bad image is a problem readers dont care what is going on in the newsroom we over report it if we need to downsize newsrooms we maybe should start with the media reporters
2870676 the news business is something worse than horrible if thats the future we dont have much of a future
2870677 im an optimist but it is very hard to be positive about whats going on
2870678 the near term and medium term at the paper is more negative than what we expected
2870679 you already were looking at more of the same which has not been good and now with the potential of a recession you are looking at the possibility of double digit declines in earnings and revenues
2870680 this is a year when some of the newer players may be hard pressed to pay the bankers
2870681 the transactions by financial buyers have been disasters so there has to be a strategic aspect for any newspaper deal to make sense
2870682 the painful realities of newspaper economics which are tough to discern from the outside become very obvious to the buyers after the fact
2870683 the industry is meeting these challenges by cutting by reducing the news hole and the people who fill it
2870684 newspapers have lived through recessions before and come back strong
2870685 my worry is that when things do turn around they will be coming back in an environment that is more competitive than ever because of the internet and that after all these cuts they will have less stature less product quality and less talent all of the things that they need to compete
2870686 oh no theres going to be a ding dong row on the deck

2870730 of course you can no problem as long as your hook ups reach we dont care how you pull in
2870731 we lost probably about 15 seconds on that probably 20 total because there were guys coming in to pit earlier and we needed to pit
2870732 crew chief steve letarte was trying to tell me to pit and i had no idea we just had a loose connection and finally they black flagged me but even while i was out there i was trying to fix it and i lost even more time doing that and so we finally got in there and shoot we came out and we were like 30th you know the car was a struggle already and the last thing we needed was to lose that much track position
2870733 its about as frustrating as you can get as a team as a driver its not any one persons fault were all in it together we have some work to do you know we had this same issue at the beginning of the sonoma race but we got some cautions to work on it we didnt have the cautions to work on it early enough here and it bit us
2870734 i cant believe we are where we are in the points to be honest with you
2870735 if it werent for us having such an awesome team we wouldnt be where we are as a team we know weve got to get the cars running better too at indianapolis it was exciting and it was great to be running up front but it was one of those weird crazy races
2870736 of course you can no problem as long as your hook ups reach we dont care how you pull in
2870737 i was behind tony and in front of all those other great drivers you dont get many chances in life to do something special like this and today im going to look back at very fondly
2870738 marcos has done one heck of a job for his first time here in a cup car and all that we needed this so badly
2870739 he was all pumped up and ready to race it definitely gives us a little bit of momentum going into next week
2870740 it made a big impact on us to finish third the wood brothers needed this
2870741 some guys just through the cycle of pit stops i did pass three or four times out there we passed quite a few on the track we passed quite a few in the pits too just with our fuel strategy i wasnt overtaken all day which im proud of and we did a lot of passing
2870742 of course you can no problem as long as your hook ups reach we dont care how you pull in
2870743 they just kind of got into each other and neither one of them said it was anything more than just hard racing both guys
2870744 it was a shame that it had the outcome for so many cars that were right there behind them at the time thats all we were checking making sure it was hard racing that we dont mind but we dont like it when it takes out a lot of cars the way it did
2870745 i had a run and i went underneath him and he just didnt give me a whole lot of room
2870746 maybe i shouldnt have been in there but were racing hard to stay in the top 35 in owner points and try to get back into the top 35 its unfortunate and im sorry for the fans and all the cars that got wrecked there and then they had to wait through that red flag
2870747 him and i were racing hard and i got underneath him going in there and he pretty much came down like i wasnt there
2870748 i tried to back out of it not to get into him he went wide so i checked the momentum up and it almost seemed like he was trying to get back at me after watching it it looked like it was racing deal and it wasnt anything blatant it just turned into a big mess with all the other cars that got into it davids all right and everybody can walk away and im sorry to all the teams that have tore up race cars i was just racing hard and trying to get the car back in the top 35 and youre racing for your job every weekend
2870749 i just hated that it ruined our day and a bunch of other innocent peoples days
2870750 our ford was running pretty good we had a good solid consistent day going and got into it there a little with the 00 car of mcdowell too bad it ended our day early but well come back and get them next week
2870751 he said he didnt really realize i was there on the outside of him and just kind of came up and kind of put us in the wall
2870752 so its a disappointing ending to a decent day we had going but well get them next week
2870753 not on my own youre gonna have to help me on this one
2870754 fat machinery is unconscious automatic or inappropriate eating that is activated by external or internal stimuli what this means is that much of our eating is done for the wrong reasons social pressure anxiety frustration and a variety of emotional stimuli that have nothing to do with our bodys need for nourishment our eating is activated by these stimuli and we move through life like robots or automatons reaching for food unconsciously when something or someone activates our eat button

2870758 everywhere it is the same the deliberate avoidance of simple literal obedience how is such a reversal possible what has happened that the word of jesus has to endure this game anywhere else in the world where commands are given the situation is clear a father says to his child go to bed the child knows exactly what to do but a child drilled in pseudo theology would have to argue thus father says go to bed he means you are tired he does not want me to be tired but i can also overcome my tiredness by going to play so although father says go to bed what he really means is go play

2870769 we have some choices at all positions how much these young kids will have an opportunity i think its just too early to tell yet
2870770 i just needed some rest for my knee after that first practice my knee just wasnt used to those long practices as soon as i get a few two a days under my belt and get used to all the running and pounding my knee is going to take i hope by next week ill be all right

2870800 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2870801 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2870802 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2870803 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2870804 que quieren sanar el mundo para ti y para todos tus amigos y que lo nico que exigen de vuelta es que compres sus poleras y hables de ellos en todas partes
2870805 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2870806 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2870807 i am leaving for personal and family reasons i want to thank ken lay for his understanding of this purely personal decision and i want to thank the board and all of my colleagues at enron
2870808 we regret jeffs decision to leave enron as he has been a big part of our success for over eleven years
2870809 but we have the strongest and deepest talent we have ever had in the organization our business is extremely strong and our growth prospects have never been better
2870810 we remain confident that we will meet the recurring earnings estimates of 44 and 1 81 per share respectively for both the third quarter and fill year 2001 and remain confident of our recent projected increased earnings for 2002 of 2 16 per share
2870811 the pacific has lost a leader who had the region at heart he was a very humble person and very sensitive to many cultures that make up the membership of the pacific islands forum family
2870812 during his time as the secretary general he was at the forefront of the implementation of the pacific plan since endorsed by forum leaders in 2005
2870813 he advocated the needs of the smaller island states within the forum and started a process for recognitions of non government organisations within the activities of the forum
2870814 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
2870815 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
2870816 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters know is who uses that language for what purpose
2870817 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
2870818 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
2870819 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
2870820 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
2870821 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
2870822 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
2870823 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
2870824 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
2870825 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
2870826 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
2870827 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
2870828 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
2870829 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
2870830 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
2870831 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
2870832 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
2870833 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
2870834 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
2870835 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
2870836 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
2870837 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
2870838 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
2870839 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
2870840 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
2870841 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
2870842 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
2870843 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
2870844 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
2870845 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
2870846 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make
2870847 there is virtually no slack in the international potash market
2870848 i need to go and rest and get plenty of calories to prepare for my next race
2870849 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2870850 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community

2870879 in my memory i dont recall 10 consecutive days of rain for the event

2870887 we should immediately call a meeting of the north atlantic council to assess georgias security and review measures nato can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation
2870888 the us should immediately convene an emergency session of the united nations security council to call on russia to reverse course
2870889 turn your attention to whos listening do you feel a presence thats your soul
2870890 in that presence is meaning and context but also there are mythical stories
2870891 the highest level of imagination we are capable of these inspire us to do what we would otherwise think is impossible
2870892 the superhero is rising in the consciousness particularly in the west
2870893 recently our culture has been telling us a really dark bleak stories and that story has brought us to the brink of disaster
2870894 of western cultures death lock its really important that we start telling new stories
2870895 we could still be launching toward disaster but i think something is actually happening were fed up
2870896 the symbolic expression of the infinite is what we call a superhero the superhero has dormant potentials that we all have
2870897 we are conditioned by the hypnosis of our culture and by the hypnosis of what other people tell us
2870898 the influence over the elements and forces of the universe
2870899 what the hell are we doing building bombs when we could be building the starship enterprise right now
2870900 supermans a secular sci fi attempt to create a picture of the higher being
2870901 we have made something that is capable of saving us

2870903 in order to get yourself to a higher level of existence
2870904 if you had only creativity and evolution you would have no universe
2870905 if you had only destructive forces the universe would dissipate into a black hole

2870907 the same divine spark that was in jesus is in you

2870909 im coming from a very different perspective and hopefully it will re illuminate it
2870910 adapted it into western forms and transformed the culture for a couple years
2870911 you have to be audacious because unless you look at this from an outsiders imagination you stay in the same mythology
2870912 we need a new identity a new identity that goes beyond race beyond ethnocentrism beyond nationalism
2870913 when we create these superheroes that are cross cultural we are all redefining our identity we are saying we are citizens of the universe
2870914 theres one organism on this planet everything thats in this room has been here for billions of years imagine all the bad stuff youve been not all here fighting one all part of the same organism
2870915 imagine an arm with fingers painted different colors fighting each other
2870916 were the cortex of this creature and every part of it is experiencing its own existence
2870917 a caterpillar seems to be destroying the leaf just like we seem to be destroying the planet
2870918 powering its metamorphosis imagine youre living on a planet thats about to give birth to a hyper entity the organisms here and it feeds on the planet earth
2870919 stop being the hand thats trying to grasp itself and fight itself
2870920 you are now staring at the field of pure potential
2870921 they exactly map onto the type of superheroes we have now
2870922 we can use 2012 as a marker for a shift in collective unconsciousness

2870945 we had all been wondering what we were going to do to mark the twenty year milestone in the biohazard history and it seemed like it was long overdue even though we are all busy with many different projects as well as other careers and music projects it has been surprisingly painless to get everyone together we had our first real jam three weeks ago and it was really amazingly tight considering it had been such a long time the longest we had ever gone without playing together our former manager scott suggested to me that i hook up with bobby hambel guitar and we do a reunion he was definitely integral in getting us all together we think that since biohazard sold nearly four million albums worldwide and has performed in virtually every corner of the earth lots of fans will come out to relive the even more famous live show get a t shirt stage dive or just reminisce

2870950 both of these political decks of cards have a little fun with the presidential candidates and also highlight some of the top political issues of our time
2870951 i could have never imagined making political figures in to wild animals could be so much fun and entertaining
2870952 they immediately made you feel so at ease as it if was your home too
2870953 we were selling the bachmans on ucla but they truly wanted to get to know us
2870954 you knew 30 40 minutes before the game they would be there smiling and cheering
2870955 the first thing she would do is apologize to the player for hitting somebody
2870956 and it wasnt sarcastic it was a genuine remark a reflection of wizs parents
2870957 they had just as much fun watching wiz play volleyball as wiz had playing volleyball
2870958 she was so happy that her parents were going to be there and she was going to get to spend some time with them
2870959 i want to stop everything right now and find the recipe for the bachman bars
2870960 sometimes we feel were better supported here than back at home
2870961 we could have the fans behind us china has always been so supportive of us
2870962 in the states when you go into someone elses house they dont usually cheer for you
2870963 i dont think that happened it just goes to show you how globally the game is getting better its fun to see
2870964 were not looking to have an advantage but i think the fans here showed us a lot of respect
2870965 in the olympic games you have to be ready to swim at any time

2870972 its really nice because it affords a corporation for instance or a gigantic wedding to have access to the carousel their own gigantic barbeque pit the play gym the skate park
2870973 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2870974 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2870975 georgia expresses its readiness to immediately start negotiations with the russian federation on a cease fire and termination of hostilities
2870976 not withdrawing but regrouping including heavy armor and increased attacks on tskhinvali
2870977 who has stood out for me in all the games so far i say burdisso he played three perfect games without making a mistake
2870978 i think the whole team would agree with me on that score
2870979 i admit it the bianconeri impressed me against manchester united
2870980 i saw a solid side one capable of demanding respect from the champions of europe their attitude really does remind me of my juventus
2870981 i walked out of old trafford convinced that ranieris team can compete with anyone in serie a and the champions league
2870982 what he has at his disposal looks like a side built to withstand the pressures of both competitions
2870983 that is a very important characteristic equal to that of experience to go far in the champions league i dont doubt that the so called old guard will do very well in europe
2870984 their hunger and rage after a year in serie b is clear in every move they make on that pitch
2870985 the current situation on the ground is very fluid and very volatile
2870986 the milf rebels have defied their own leadership and have refused to leave the area
2870987 everything looks good to me for next weeks confederation cup at flamboro

2870989 this is the beginning of a new chapter for the dollar as ecb president jean claude trichet and other central banks are paying more attention to the downside risk to growth
2870990 the decline of oil prices is a significant driver behind this dollar rally because it enables other central banks to turn their eyes away from inflation and focus on growth
2870991 likely to remain well above levels consistent with price stability for a protracted period of time
2870992 the dollar is in my view in a genuine recovery
2870993 conditions for a major development in great britain are not met to date
2870994 we thought it was a good deal and we were ready to accept it would have been a sensible way to take forward new nuclear plans in the u k

2871285 meeting my girlfriend at the olympic games eight years ago was obviously a highlight of my career carrying the flag was different ive been with my girlfriend for eight years carrying the flag took ten minutes
2871286 i grew up watching the likes of carl lewis and in 1992 seeing mark rose win a swiss tennis gold it is great to be part of it
2871287 were are all chasing the same thing olympic gold not money
2871288 ninety five percent of the high level tennis players are here were proud that tennis is part of the olympic games
2871289 at every tournament there are a handful of players who are the favorites and i am one of them
2871290 there is too much attention including from other athletes i want to prepare perfectly so that means getting away from it
2871291 there are so many things to see and do it is a dream come true to be here
2871292 forty four million americans carry in their wallet or purse something that makes them needlessly more vulnerable to identity theft its their medicare card
2871293 seniors have spent a lifetime building their financial security their savings and credit should not be put at risk if someone steals their medicare card
2871294 the epa no matter who the next administration is is going to have a huge number of issues to deal with right at the beginning
2871295 explanation deploys the logic of the queen of hearts substituting epas desires for the plain text
2871296 we have an opportunity in time and i think dealing with them all at once would facilitate industry planning
2871297 its worth a try to try to solve all these problems
2871298 if they could get a reasonable bill through congress that would be a good result
2871299 people would really like to have certainty on the other hand it depends a bit on what the price would be for that certainty
2871300 theres only so much political capital out there to do environmental stuff
2871301 i dont know that we should wait if we can come to consensus on a three p bill
2871302 now were left with a laundry list of uncertainty very costly uncertainty
2871303 in the time it took me to write this post i could have earned 4 38
2871304 it looked like i didnt have to worry about the score group and i was right they treated me like a movie star id come back any time they said i also had a nice butt so they asked me to pose for their booty magazine
2871305 i will not tolerate a single patient at oregon state hospital living in fear of assault
2871306 this was a serious incident that occurred within a vulnerable population and calls for far reaching investigation to safeguard the well being of all our patients
2871307 this regulator has been of interest to researchers and clinicians for many years now because its controller or receptor found on the surface of blood cells is critical in regulating their many functions
2871308 because our discovery shows precisely what the receptor looks like and also how it works we can now begin to design new drugs to rein in the deadly abnormal blood cells
2871309 abnormal gm csf signalling is pivotal to a variety of serious and difficult to treat diseases
2871310 with this discovery rational design of targeted therapies can now be accelerated greatly
2871311 i hasten to express to you once more my deep gratitude for the affectionate reception which i received from you and all your fellow citizens
2871312 i was honoured by the official welcoming ceremony at government house and most appreciative of the personal welcome which you extended to me at your sydney residence admiralty house
2871313 please also accept my heartfelt thanks for the many courtesies afforded me throughout my visit
2871314 i am grateful to the various civil and military authorities of australia as well as the residents and business people of sydney whose spirit of collaboration helped to ensure the warm welcome of the pilgrims and the smooth progress of my visit
2871315 may the lord bless all of you abundantly for your kindness and hospitality
2871316 inflation has reached 4 5 per cent yet paramedics are being offered annual increases of 3 25 per cent basically theyre being offered a pay cut how can they accept that
2871317 hoped to see a considerable amount of progress in the next four weeks
2871318 certainly i would think in the next four to five weeks if there has been little progress i think were left with no choice but to go to the industrial relations commission and mount a case for putting industrial action to a ballot of our members
2871319 the ultimate action would be stop work action if it got to a serious point
2871320 but unless we get fair pay increases and issues like fatigue are dealt with who will want to work as a paramedic
2871321 the biggest threat to the eight is the french in the relay they have posted the best times coming into beijing and it will be a fierce battle
2871322 i heard the crowd obviously we had offers but they were not enough so we decided he needed to stay with us
2871323 it is not positive that we may not have the players we want here before the champions league game
2871324 the situation has been very difficult for us we have had a lot of players returning to training late after international games in the summer and now we have players at the olympics
2871325 i believe we are ready for the champions league tie the experienced players are ready but we know that we have quality from the young players
2871326 i think fate deals you certain cards and it has dealt us this draw
2871327 from a personal point of view it is disappointing but we have to concentrate on kaunas and not rangers
2871328 in the case of invisibility cloaks or shields the material would need to curve light waves completely around the object like a river flowing around a rock
2871329 an observer looking at the cloaked object would then see light from behind it making it seem to disappear
2871330 i have been thinking that i would make a proposition to my republican friends that if they will stop telling lies about the democrats we will stop telling the truth about them
2871331 i think every single candidate for president republican and democratic have lives personal lives that indicate something about what kind of human being they are and i think it is a fair evaluation for america to engage in to look at what kind of human beings each of us are and what kind of president wed make

2871373 anakku aku sudah berkeliling mencari suara hati yang berdoa buatmu tapi sampai saat ini baru 3 orang yang berdoa buatmu sementara waktumu tinggal 60 menit lagi rasanya mustahil kalau dalam waktu dekat ini ada 50 orang yang berdoa buat kesembuhanmu
2871374 aku akan memberitahukanmu kenapa tuhan rindu memberikanmu kesempatan kedua itu karena doa istrimu yang tidak putus putus berharap akan kesembuhanmu
2871375 tuhan aku tahu kalau selama hidupnya suamiku bukanlah suami atau ayah yang baik aku tahu dia sudah mengkhianati pernikahan kami aku tahu dia tidak jujur dalam bisnisnya dan kalaupun dia memberikan sumbangan itu hanya untuk popularitas saja untuk menutupi perbuatannya yang tidak benar dihadapanmu tapi tuhan tolong pandang anak anak yang telah engkau titipkan pada kami mereka masih membutuhkan seorang ayah hamba tidak mampu membesarkan mereka seorang diri
2871376 ada beberapa yang berdoa buatmu tapi mereka tidak tulus bahkan ada yang mensyukuri penyakit yang kau derita saat ini itu semua karena selama ini kamu arogan egois dan bukanlah atasan yang baik bahkan kau tega memecat karyawan yang tidak bersalah
2871377 benar anakku kau pernah memberi bantuan bagi mereka beberapa bulan yang lalu walau aku tahu tujuanmu saat itu hanya untuk mencari popularitas saja dan untuk menarik perhatian pemerintah dan investor luar negeri
2871378 ya tuhan saya mencintai mu dan membutuhkan mu datang dan terangilah hati kami sekarang

2871407 we had a better quarter when compared to the same period last year with sales up 3 5 and earnings before items increasing 23 million despite a 5 9 drop in paper shipments clearly the synergies are starting to show in our results and the projected benefits from new initiatives have led us to increase our synergy target to 250 million
2871408 having said that the announced price increases for papers in june are necessary to adjust to this new business environment of structurally higher input costs
2871409 while trade publications have painted a fairly negative demand picture for the paper industry so far in 2008 domtars core business has weathered the storm quite well with no lack of order downtime shipments to production close to 100 and paper inventories virtually flat from march end levels the closure of the port edwards mill in june further tightened our manufacturing system the u s economy remains challenging and we will be closely tracking our order books and will make adjustments to production where needed to respond to customer demand
2871410 the financial results in our wood business improved significantly in the second quarter better than what we had expected and this is due to higher prices but also to the concerted efforts made by our employees to reduce costs and improve the efficiency of our operations

2871413 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2871414 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2871415 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2871416 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2871417 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2871418 i bought my grand piano before id even bought any furniture
2871419 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2871420 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2871421 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2871440 as of today most of the city tskhinvali is controlled by russian peacekeeping forces
2871441 our troops are in good shape there has been a very organised relocation and russia has lost 20 aircraft
2871442 they our forces have been withdrawn completely because of the heavy casualties georgia has suffered
2871443 the humanitarian situation is horrifying we have no cameras and cannot document what we can see but the morgues are busy receiving streams of dead bodies
2871444 we have fulfilled our side of the initiative the russians have not but on the contrary have increased their military presence
2871445 the russians despite the size of the forces that have entered georgia have failed to defeat our troops but we have to be realistic it is going to be very difficult to face up to them
2871446 they are state criminals who must be tried for the crimes committed in south ossetia the genocide of the ossetian people
2871447 we have received proposals for some sort of contact from the georgian side but we see yet again that they fail to grasp the meaning of what happened in the early 1990s when abkhazia and south ossetia broke away and they do not understand or do not want to understand what is going on now
2871448 the crews are assigned the task to not allow arms and military hardware supplies to reach georgia by sea
2871449 ukraine reserves the right to bar warships and vessels which could take part in the action from returning to ukrainian territory until the conflict is solved

2871453 its probably the biggest impact in the shortest time that i can think of
2871454 if i can use some of that heat energy and convert it to electricity you can improve the overall efficiency
2871455 there are several other steps that are required to commercialize the material but were cautiously optimistic that these steps can be carried out successfully
2871456 we think we can make people feel cooler more quickly feel comfortable more quickly and that will translate into less power in the central ac system
2871457 i cant say whether dimitar is happy or not i just know that i would be very happy to keep him here
2871458 i would be absolutely delighted if berbatov was still at the club after the end of the transfer window and i really hope that is the case
2871459 he is a magnificent player and we want to enjoy another season

2871489 there was not one disappointment its turned into quite a tourism draw and an anchor event for the area
2871490 people have come from all over boston texas british columbia europe about 75 per cent of people here are from away
2871491 it is catching on in the community but i think some people here dont yet realize the high calibre of talent we have
2871492 raitt is in a league of her own our reputation has built and shell tell other artists about us
2871493 surprised if we did not break even or make money from it
2871494 last year we had an 800 profit and ive been told it takes six years or more to really make money
2871495 it needs continuous attention we need to spend more time on it because theres just so much to do people have no idea how much work goes into it
2871496 sometimes we get a slow period and then we get a rush right now its a rush but id rather be busy than not
2871497 the president used to receive regular reports on the political situation in the country from the isi and the mi these reports in sealed envelopes marked eyes only were usually handed over to the president by the c in c on a few occasions the president gave me these reports and it seemed to me that the agencies were keeping the politicians particularly the east pakistanis under close surveillance i rarely found anything insightful in these reports the dib had direct access to the president and his weekly reports used to be fairly exhaustive it was during the presidential election in l964 that the isi and the mi became extremely active emphasis added
2871498 dont just tell me were losing clarke tell me what the expletive deleted to do about it
2871499 bin laden is safe and no damage has been done to any of his companions

2871505 my sincere prayer is that his family will be comforted by the warmth of love from all of us who knew and respected this man
2871506 another milestone in chinas rising international status and a historical event in the great renaissance of the chinese nation
2871507 with the host city it does not become involved in politics
2871508 for example the wind industry it was nothing in the 1970s today one third of all terrestrial wind turbines in the world come from denmark
2871509 we got 99 percent of our energy from the middle east today it is zero
2871510 i have observed that in all other countries including in america people are complaining about how prices of gasoline are going up
2871511 the cure is not to reduce the price but on the contrary to raise it even higher to break our addiction to oil we are going to introduce a new tax reform in the direction of even higher taxation on energy and the revenue generated on that will be used to cut taxes on personal income so we will improve incentives to work and improve incentives to save energy and develop renewable energy
2871512 weve had 35 new competitors coming out of china in the last 18 months
2871513 they have to be restored otherwise the case that the president has acted unconstitutionally is not convincing
2871514 its the start of something that can be great weve been waiting for years for this moment
2871515 i dont know how many people were watching the game but it was an honour to play in it
2871516 we were all excited and anxious this game was over the top
2871517 but we have a saying back home that when youre good you play for the name on the front of your jersey instead of the name on the back our guys all play for the name on the front of their jersey
2871518 i would have hoped to have an easier flow into a guy like that
2871519 he only knows one way to come moving forward but hes tricky hes not coming straight forward and im hoping hell walk into some of my shots
2871520 once i fell behind i knew i needed to go for that one gusto i started keeping my hands down trying to draw him in it worked against me but if you want to win youve got to take that chance trupish said

2871524 what was wrong with me that you couldnt love me like i love my daughter
2871525 our tax gdp ratio is lower than any other country in the world
2871526 but our population is still increasing at a rapid pace with it comes the rapidly increasing demand for gas power road communications and other infrastructure
2871527 in the present situation the government alone cannot meet these demands the problem has to be solved through united efforts of the government and the private sector
2871528 the gdp growth of bangladesh can reach two digits if the problems of gas power and ports can be solved
2871529 so far expected developments have not taken place with the countrys infrastructure due to political causes red tape mismanagement and other reasons
2871530 but without development in this sector the country cannot progress economically the development of the private sector itself is hindered
2871531 the government will formulate friendly policy improve law and order and ensure a favourable investment climate
2871532 the private sector will have to take advantage of these and come forward to meet infrastructure needs
2871533 the major portion of total investments now comes through the private sector the private sectors contribution is key in gdp growth and creation of employment and plays an important role in poverty elimination
2871534 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted

2871537 het gaat gewoon niet zo goed ik ben niet zo in vorm
2871538 door die gouden plak is een groot deel van mijn toernooi al geslaagd
2871539 het valt me tegen op trainingskamp ging het heel goed maar ik zwem niet hard in de wedstrijden ergens gaat het mis maar waar het precies aan ligt weet ik niet maar daar komen we nog wel achter
2871540 het lijkt erop alsof wij de enige ploeg zijn die hier moe worden
2871541 ik heb inderdaad betere wedstrijden op het middenveld gespeeld in het begin van de wedstrijd haddeen we een man over op het middenveld en kregen we ruimte op de zijkanten
2871542 heel verrassend ik had verwacht mijn record kwijt te raken
2871543 trickett zwom heel lang onder het wereldrecord maar in de laatste meters ging het mis
2871544 ze kwam slecht uit en tikte ze daarom slecht aan
2871545 dit is altijd mijn doel geweest dus het is fantastisch dat het nu lukt het record van de bruijn blijkt uitzonderlijk moeilijk te breken maar over vier jaar heb ik weer een kans
2871546 dia nyaris identik dengan saya dia adalah pemegang rekor dunia di semua event dia mendominasi cabang renang seperti yang saya lakukan dulu
2871547 tidak ada yang bisa saya katakan atau perbuat untuk mencegah ini patahnya rekor terjadi
2871548 saya pikir apa yang telah saya lakukan menginspirasinya dia terinspirasi untuk mengikuti jejak saya
2871549 saya memenangi tujuh nomor jika saya mereka dulu mempunyai nomor 50 meter gaya bebas saya mungkin bisa memenanginya juga
2871550 anda tak bisa bilang cesc ada dalam kondisi terbaiknya tapi dia nanti akan cukup bugar
2871551 hes a man with a plan got a counterfeit dollar in his hand hes misstra know it all
2871552 hes a man with a plan got a counterfeit dollar in his hand hes misstra know it all
2871553 a fat balding pasty faced white man whos a conservative lemming of drug addict lying criminal rush limbaugh
2871554 i love your blog you must be an outstanding person
2871555 hes a man with a plan got a counterfeit dollar in his hand hes misstra know it all
2871556 the child was alive when he got to the hospital but we dont know the extent of his injuries
2871557 its really early to tell at this point his condition is grave
2871558 it could have a significant chilling effect on the reporting of the private lives of celebrities
2871559 the most significant changes to the privacy act in the 20 years of its existence
2871560 there is a strong expectation that special minister of state senator john faulkner will commit the government to act on the alrcs recommendations and that he will introduce relevant legislative amendments in the foreseeable future
2871561 protection of privacy needs to be balanced against the public interest in allowing the free flow of information and upholding freedom of speech
2871562 it has not been demonstrated that existing privacy protections fail to achieve this balance
2871563 the alrc has failed to demonstrate a breach of privacy by the media is not already dealt with by existing laws such as defamation and surveillance laws or self regulation by the media
2871564 the law would be irrelevant to ordinary citizens in whom the media has no interest
2871565 such a law would simply allow rich people to employ lawyers in a bid to avoid scrutiny of their wrongdoing
2871566 it allows the rich powerful and celebrities to manipulate their images in the way they want them manipulated rather than having some transparency
2871567 they said privacy laws would be ok on the whole if anyone with a pr agent was exempt from taking an action
2871568 i think it may be a sensible development for the media as it would mean the defamation laws dont get stretched to be used as a substitute for proper protection against invasion of privacy
2871569 yep i like the idea of a right to privacy and yep i like the idea of a right to freedom of expression
2871570 there would be very few observers in the marketplace that would say to you coles and woolworths are not vigorously competing against each other
2871571 the grocery market is workably competitive that term is used to describe a market in which competition exists but it is definitely not as competitive as it should be
2871572 when i use a word it means just what i choose it to mean neither more nor less
2871573 a significant number of consumers do use the prices of specific items to choose the grocery store they will visit
2871574 the majority of consumers either compare prices on a limited range of products shortly before visiting the store or compare prices over a longer period of time
2871575 cdep is one hell of a weapon to take aboriginal peoples rights
2871576 i would like to take every dollar of cdep and build a training school and give skills to our people for their future
2871577 almost everything that westerners eat is packaged and its the total opposite for most other people
2871578 i no longer entertain any doubt that homosexuality is compatible with perfect mental and physical health
2871579 compatible with perfect mental and physical health but he did have a few things to say about the then current state of the art
2871580 see this is yet another example that goes to prove the authority of scripture
2871581 given the stakes the united states has called for a moratorium on all armed hostilities in a statement issued by secretary of state condoleezza rice the
2871582 an immediate ceasefire to the armed conflict in georgias region of south ossetia
2871583 georgias status as a u s ally further complicates matters approximately 130 american military trainers are presently stationed in the country and upwards of 1000 marines and soldiers had billeted at the vaziani military base in july to train georgian troops meanwhile a contingent from georgia is currently serving alongside allied forces in iraq
2871584 the whole world is on fire and where exactly is our congressional leadership eating ribs at an election bbq fundraiser or partying in beijing
2871585 historically russia has been and will continue to be a guarantor of security for peoples of the caucasus
2871586 the summer of mayhem 2008 is now available for free in windows streaming media or via podcast the mnm on itunes
2871587 the people who stand behind the arenas are the ones paying our bills god bless each amp every person that stands out there
2871588 if it was not for the king there would not be no downtown bruno he really set a lot of people on their way god bless him
2871589 how can you put a pricetag on that just like the credit card commercial it was priceless
2871590 i dont see why not as vince mcmahon is fond of saying stay tuned you never know
2871591 was full of bull sh t i had nothing to do with it i dont even know if there was a letter there might have been and i wont say there wasnt but i certainly did not do it
2871592 some of these real credible websites that put up this crap do not know their ss from their elbows i certainly did not have anything to do with that
2871593 its going to be electric every year it gets better amp better this coming years wrestlemania is going to knock your socks off i wish it was tomorrow
2871594 summer of mayhem 2008 bonus interview bruno gives his uncensored thoughts amp takes on why there are no pictures of jerry lawler in his new book why he feels the right decision was made to have william shatner induct
2871595 so what is this small batch stuff is this just more marketing crap dreamed up by distillers
2871596 i will de popcorn every new venue i acquire it has a disproportionate influence on the space in terms of its overwhelming smell the cultural idea of it and the operational problems created by the mess it produces
2871597 but i am saying there is no way in which it fits with the culturally sophisticated brand i wish to sell
2871598 as a town were just over thirty years old we encompass a number of small cottage communities that have grown together along highway 26 and moseley street
2871599 around that we have a water park go carts mini golf outside the town we have the rounds ranch with horseback riding and of course there are boating opportunities and fishing as well
2871600 we have a lot of trails miles of them for biking hiking cross country skiing snowshoeing and snowmobiling
2871601 most of this is part of the ganaraska trail and is maintained by the wasaga beach provincial park which occupies a third of our town
2871602 after recreation and tourism construction comes next in terms of our biggest industries
2871603 we are the fastest growing area in the province a lot of people move here most of them either retired semi retired or young families a number of people commute to the honda factory in allison or to jobs in barrie people are moving here because of the lifestyle
2871604 you will see a lot of the old cottages coming down and a lot of huge homes going up
2871605 there are also new subdivisions to the south of the river and a number of gated retirement communities weve started serving the town with water and sewer and thats supported a lot of growth though there are still issues for us to deal with
2871606 we used to be the railhead of ontario and the harbour was the shipping point for goods destined to western canada there were drydocks and repair facilities they are no longer in operation but our manufacturing sector is still one of our strongest employers
2871607 its one of the first municipalities designated by the federal government as a heritage area
2871608 so there are strict guidelines for development were retaining the look and feel of the downtown it all has to be really eye appealing and complementing foot traffic
2871609 were working closely for the intensification of that sector to bring in more residential and professional offices we have a strong downtown business improvement association weve also expanded the downtowns boundaries so it can grow
2871610 like any other municipality weve had to work to ensure there were adequate services available at the hospital that serves the region
2871611 one of our biggest challenges has been retaining our rail infrastructure we worked with canadian pacific for almost a decade to ensure we could retain rail service and we finally partnered with the city of barrie to buy the rail line destined for abandonment creating the barrie collingwood railway or bcry
2871612 hume street is expanding into a commercial area the hospital is located there and it extends the commercial area to the east it supports not just commercial development but a strong industrial sector as well you need to ensure in any sustainable community that you have a variety of homes a good retail pull employment and a good strong labour force
2871613 so what is this small batch stuff is this just more marketing crap dreamed up by distillers
2871614 people start taking vacations before school starts and high school people have sports practice so it gets tough
2871615 nous avons triomph gaza a gagn son ind pendance de la cisjordanie un seul peuple a d sormais deux etats deux prisons qui ne se saluent pas nous sommes des victimes habill es en bourreaux
2871616 the reason half the world feels lonely is because the other half is pretending to be perfect
2871617 several contestants showed up in a surprise appearance trying to snag the title away from katie but they were no match for the beautiful and talented former beauty queen
2871618 im going there and well make something beautiful happen out of what was a totally unfair mess for me but thats in the past im not looking back im going forward and well try to have the success i wanted originally
2871619 i go with my best friend summer who is also in the show with me we go to places like bebe bebe sport charlotte rouse and guess we just like to go try on clothes and sometimes buy matching stuff we usually go get something to eat too
2871620 the first stop is at the candy shop and i buy enough to last me all day long and especially gummy fish
2871621 i usually end up spending too much money i always buy clothes and especially shoes i like the fashion show mall the best
2871622 its total chaos i like to buy clothes makeup and accessories like shoes i like to shop at boca park and stay within my budget
2871623 i like to go to the fashion show mall and pretty much buy whatever catches my eye i like bebe and abercrombie im usually never looking for anything in particular
2871624 i buy shoes at bee bee sport at the fashion show mall i may spend a half a day to a whole day

2871635 caesars has set new standards of excellence in the past few years now were raising the bar in the salon spa industry and i am thrilled to be part of it
2871636 i love vegas i come for the shows the sports the restaurants and the shopping and now im coming for the spa this was the perfect mini vacation squeezed in between miss america and returning to canada for a christmas movie for disney
2871637 i use luxe ingredients but i dont take myself seriously i respect the food i work with i simply fell in love with the kitchen this is a fun adventure where my goal is to engage all the sense i decided to abandon the traditional approach to food and incorporate all kinds of crazy twists but in the end it has to taste fantastic and it does i simply wanted to awe my guests and make dining with me the most joyful experience of their day
2871638 our performances are more about the art of burlesque we try to stay true to what burlesque was back in its heyday the sometimes frilly sometimes shiny and always sexy burlesque costumes help turn back the clock and bring back the pin up era if only during the performances whether its a fan dance a snake charmer skit a holiday inspired routine or the classic shimmy vintage burlesque groups like babes in sin are the intelligent alternative to the modern girls gone wild burlesque has more visual foreplay and as cha cha pictured right notes
2871639 for me its been great being part of this troupe has really done a lot for me i have an outlet to be creative though my choreography and costume design i really have fun with my numbers i try to add a little humor or a trick to my performances i am also know to twirl my tassel like no other
2871640 without the departure of saakashvili it is impossible to stop the conflict in south ossetia
2871641 muchos directivos presumen de mantener a sus equipos bajo una presi n permanente asumiendo err neamente que la capacidad de resistencia de los trabajadores es ilimitada llega un momento en que no pueden m s y se rompen esa ruptura se produce en forma de enfermedad de estr s o de baja laboral
2871642 para sacar el m ximo nivel de los trabajadores lo mejor es tratarlos bien y evaluar realista y racionalmente las cargas de trabajo
2871643 algunos exprimen la plantilla hasta que sufre de raquitismo organizativo
2871644 que guarda la cerca y mantiene a raya a los d scolos
2871645 algunos directivos t xicos neomanagers parten del principio de que el conflicto entre personas no s lo es inevitable sino que es necesario fundamentar la tarea directiva en las oportunidades que ste ofrece al manager los psic patas organizativos son expertos en crear condiciones favorecedoras para ellos bas ndose en conflictos que ellos mismos generan
2871646 s ndrome de supervivencia organizativo cada cual se ve a s mismo como un n ufrago capaz de cualquier cosa con tal de sobrevivir las situaciones de precariedad mantenidas en el tiempo buscan a veces mantener a los trabajadores en un sometimiento cuasifeudal quien no sabe si se le va a renovar el mes que viene no s lo vive con ansiedad y estr s a adido sino que se vuelve un depredador de sus compa eros toda solidaridad desaparece por efecto del miedo a perder el medio de sustento
2871647 algo que hace sufrir a los trabajadores mucho m s de lo que parece
2871648 el reconocimiento por el trabajo bien hecho es una rara avis en las organizaciones actuales se asume que tener trabajo un d a m s ya es suficiente premio eso es desconocer que el ser humano necesita reconocimiento ste no ha de ser siempre de tipo econ mico pero ha de existir
2871649 much simas empresas han reconvertido sus trabajadores en falsos aut nomos lo que multiplica la precariedad de stos que pasan a ser proveedores de su propia
2871650 los abusos a los que se presta esta situaci n son inimaginables vivir cada mes con el miedo a no facturar es algo terrible de ah que en recientes estudios caso del cisneros vi sean los empleados aut nomos quienes hayan dado los niveles m ximos de estr s
2871651 con la crisis todos los se ores feudales ven maximizadas sus oportunidades de abusar de los que ven mayor dificultad en cambiar de trabajo esto lo saben muchos de nuestros maltratadotes habituales y lo explotan
2871652 es el lugar preferido del psic pata organizacional ya que lo que anhela es alcanzar el poder cuanto antes y el poder absoluto
2871653 organizaciones feudales impropias del siglo xxi en nuestro tiempo los trabajadores viven en la paradoja de ser ciudadanos y personas que tienen derechos reconocidos y al mismo tiempo de dejar colgados esos mismos derechos fundamentales junto con sus abrigos a la entrada de las empresas y organizaciones para las que trabajan
2871654 los mediocres necesitan maquinar mucho contra los brillantes como stos no necesitan politiquear para subir con el tiempo descuidan sus posiciones y son los otros los que triunfan una vez que un mediocre alcanza el poder se rodea de subordinados que no le amenacen es decir de personas a n m s torpes que l por eso los directivos narcisistas y mediocres extienden la mediocridad por toda la organizaci n

2871658 there was a widely held perception that the show would fail without ted koppel

2871661 my hope is that we are going to see nightline enter a new golden era

2871667 it will be an unimpeachable document supported by documentary evidence of all the acts of omission and commission committed by president musharraf that make him liable to impeachment several times
2871668 we are in the government now and have access to many previously confidential documents after going through these documents we are surprised over the horrendous nature of the crimes committed by president musharraf during his almost nine year rule
2871669 the man will have to go it is a political reality and impeachment is just a legal and constitutional procedure to realise it
2871670 if the charge sheet is put into river ravi it will come into flood as far as gross irregularities and constitutional violations are concerned
2871671 the revelation if true lends enormous credence to what was generally talked about in the streets of pakistan about the likely killers of ms bhutto it also lends dramatic significance to the last email she had sent to her lobbyist in the us pointing out dangers to her life and indicating also who she suspected could be involved if something happened to her

2871688 gee dear i dont have anything to do today lets take a stroll and peruse the condo notice board im sure well find something interesting
2871689 if we become part of russia i think that the way we live will in many ways be better than it is now
2871690 this is positive to the market in the short term but we still have to keep an eye on how this story will end finally
2871691 it will jump at the openning trade but it might not go far beyond 705 points
2871692 the shrimping industry took it on the chin more than any other commercial sector on the gulf coast
2871693 were very close to the point where we need to decide whether were going to keep going or not
2871694 if you have to keep scratching to make a living its not worth it
2871695 we started seeing fishermen abandoning the fisheries and were still seeing it
2871696 the better the year they have the lower the price we get
2871697 the whole issue was created by separatist leaders who would like to stop the hindu pilgrimage the real motive is a complete islamisation of the valley after having successfully forced kashmiri hindus to leave the valley
2871698 this is not a struggle merely for 100 acres of land this is the struggle for the identity of our motherland
2871699 i think you can preserve the integrity of the local library and still find a way to make the system fairer
2871700 yes money is a factor but you cant let money rule you
2871701 you take what you have and you do the best you can with it
2871702 he hadnt been chief minister very long and that in itself was a difficulty because his record in office was quite short
2871703 a lot of people were probably quite upset by the timing of the election they werent convinced by the reason the chief minister gave
2871704 its not their gig they like to be friendly with all the parties because they cant pick and chose whose going to be in national power
2871705 i think they would run a mile rather than get caught up in some local political shindig
2871706 we deliberately didnt touch on that out of respect for the moment and just acknowledged each others path and what happened on the weekend as member for nelson and member for blain
2871707 it was absolutely amazing within several days after that email being circulated a number of people came to our door and said we heard youre strapped for cash heres our cheque
2871708 their record on education and education is one of the big issues has been appalling through their whole government and basically the chicken has come home to roost
2871709 this swing againt labour would not have been so great if the party had kept clair martin as their leaded for this election

2871723 i clearly pointed out the human rights issues and made them aware of dutch concerns on the subjects of press freedom the position of human rights defenders and the rights of minorities
2871724 that is chinese for we dont allow you to be here when it comes to outer appearance the peoples republic is the country of unlimited possibilities but behind the fa ade is the harsh reality of limited personal freedom
2871725 the military institution says it is ok to kill and use the most horrible weapons and that killing the enemy is heroic
2871726 i respect dick for having humanity over his military obligations
2871727 the regular people and the government wanted to surrender but the military people didnt want to surrender
2871728 i believe it is the stubbornness of the military people that caused the bombing of japan
2871729 when he said no she apologized and assured him that she would find him later
2871730 i left the hospital today just after 12 noon memphis time

2871733 im in talks right now i think i found a really good space
2871734 we now know that our sun and its family of planets is not unusual
2871735 architecturally this new planetary system is reminiscent of ours albeit souped up all the planets in this new system are more massive by factors of 5 to 10
2871736 we havent found a twin of our solar system because the four planets close to the star are all the size of neptune or bigger
2871737 what we see in our solar system is that we are full up on planets there are very few tiny windows where you can drop even a moon sized object in and have it survive in a stable orbit
2871738 if there were a moon around this planet it would have a rocky surface
2871739 water on it could in principle puddle into lakes and oceans serving as the solvent for biochemistry
2871740 to go from the first detections of planets around sun like stars to finding a full fledged solar system with a planet in a habitable zone in just 12 years is an amazing accomplishment and a testament to the years of hard work put in by these investigators
2871741 it is amazing to see our ability to detect extrasolar planets growing
2871742 we are finding solar systems with a richness of planets and a variety of planetary types comparable to our own
2871743 finding five extrasolar planets orbiting a star is only one small step
2871744 i dont mind working out but weights make me look big and i only want to lose weight and tone up
2871745 i want to lose weight and all of this fat that i gained just tell me what to do and i will do it i swear
2871746 initially when he was hospitalized we expected him to come back home but as the weeks went on i kind of knew
2871747 he was a hard man and he made no apologies for that
2871748 when it came to me and my mother and my daughter he was the softest
2871749 i kind of figured he was going to get a lot of backlash
2871750 telling that joke at that time probably wasnt the best idea but thats him
2871751 im sad that my daughter will never know or be able to feel how much he loved her
2871752 i think he will always be remembered as one of the original kings of comedy
2871753 i think what made him so special to people was that even though he was a celebrity he just seemed so down to earth and so much like a part of your family

2871755 it is extremely important to maintain the security and integrity of the fare media systems

2871757 if you prevent legitimate researchers from talking about their findings its not going to stop people from finding vulnerabilities its going to stop the good guys from talking about them and from learning from each other

2871763 a thousand times more uv b radiation that do the oceans around antarctica during the height of the ozone hole yet many of the same species of phytoplankton thrive in both areas with little or no apparent damage
2871764 when you ask this gang overseeing ozone depletion and global warming how much two plus two is they first ask why do you want to know
2871765 with regard to global climate issues we are experiencing politically correct science
2871766 many atmospheric scientists are afraid for their funding which is why they dont challenge al gore and his colleagues they have a pretty clear idea of what the answer theyre supposed to get is the attitude in the administration is if you get a wrong result we dont want to hear about it
2871767 the overwhelming majority of scientist now agree climate change is being caused by man
2871768 its unfortunate that people read the media hype before they read the report
2871769 we say quite clearly that few scientists would say the attribution of global warming to human causes issue was a done deal
2871770 the balance of evidence suggests a human influence on global climate

2871782 and as the patriarch has authority to do all he wishes in a fitting manner in such things as are beneath his authority so the patriarch of rome has authority over all patriarchs like the blessed peter over all the community for he who is in rome also keeps the office of peter in all the church he who transgresses against these things the ecumenical synod places under anathema
2871783 with the changing face of computing someone needed to come up with a fast easy hot swappable method of docking hard drives to a desktop or laptop that doesnt involve seating it in an enclosure or case yet provide enough protection to read or write to the drive then move on to the next drive easily thermaltake decided to fill that need and designed their blacx line of docking stations we felt the need for this type of storage so when we got the chance to test the thermaltake blacx se we were ready to see if it would fit the bill
2871784 restoring unity among all branches of the church of the east bridging the theological gap with the protestants re establishing communion with other christians financially helping our needy people in the middle east and bringing unity to the chaldo assyrian community of iraq
2871785 in the past two years i have stated several times that our side would not establish a new independent branch of the church of the east nor would it abandon or replace church of the east tradition with another one we are and shall always remain faithful to the lord worshipping him within the church of the east patrimony practically speaking this means that we as a diocese i e a bishop priests deacons and faithful shall unite with one of the two remaining branches of the church of the east tradition either the ancient church of the east or the chaldean catholic church

2871792 in your mercifulness my lord you have deemed the vileness of our feeble nature worthy to be made recognized member in the great body of the holy catholic church to administer spiritual assistance to the souls of the faithful
2871793 to the great rome authority was given because the two pillars are laid in the grave there peter i say the head of the apostles and paul the teacher of the nations rome is the first see and the head of the patriarchs
2871794 and as the patriarch has authority to do all he wishes in a fitting manner in such things as are beneath his authority so the patriarch of rome has authority over all patriarchs like the blessed peter over all the community for he who is in rome also keeps the office of peter in all the church he who transgresses against these things the ecumenical synod places under anathema

2871831 is the goal of the russian federation to change the leadership of georgia

2871840 heres one for you lets say theres a sick person over here and you can cure him you can do it would you help him would you try
2871841 but why not say that youd help a sick and maimed person if you could most of us would if we could but god doesnt
2871842 he doesnt does he my brother was a catholic who died of cancer even though he prayed to jesus to heal him how is this jesus good hmmm can you answer that one
2871843 thats right god made satan didnt he tell me son is there evil in this world
2871844 evils everywhere isnt it and god did make everything correct
2871845 if god created everything then god created evil since evil exists and according to the principle that our works define who we are then god is evil
2871846 is there sickness immorality hatred ugliness all these terrible things do they exist in this world
2871847 science says you have five senses you use to identify and observe the world around you have you ever seen jesus
2871848 have you ever felt your jesus tasted your jesus or smelt your jesus have you ever had any sensory perception of jesus christ or god for that matter
2871849 according to the rules of empirical testable demonstrable protocol science says your god doesnt exist what do you say to that son
2871850 and that is the problem science has with god there is no evidence only faith
2871851 you can have lots of heat even more heat super heat mega heat unlimited heat white heat a little heat or no heat but we dont have anything called cold we can hit up to 458 degrees below zero which is no heat but we cant go any further after that there is no such thing as cold otherwise we would be able to go colder than the lowest 458 degrees
2871852 every body or object is susceptible to study when it has or transmits energy and heat is what makes a body or matter have or transmit energy absolute zero 458 f is the total absence of heat you see sir cold is only a word we use to describe the absence of heat we cannot measure cold heat we can measure in thermal units because heat is energy cold is not the opposite of heat sir just the absence of it
2871853 what about darkness professor is there such a thing as darkness
2871854 youre wrong again sir darkness is not something it is the absence of something you can have low light normal light bright light flashing light but if you have no light constantly you have nothing and its called darkness isnt it thats the meaning we use to define the word
2871855 in reality darkness isnt if it were you would be able to make darkness darker wouldnt you
2871856 yes professor my point is your philosophical premise is flawed to start with and so your conclusion must also be flawed
2871857 you argue that there is life and then theres death a good god and a bad god you are viewing the concept of god as something finite something we can measure sir science cant even explain a thought
2871858 it uses electricity and magnetism but has never seen much less fully understood either one to view death as the opposite of life is to be ignorant of the fact that death cannot exist as a substantive thing death is not the opposite of life just the absence of it
2871859 now tell me professor do you teach your students that they evolved from a monkey
2871860 if you are referring to the natural evolutionary process young man yes of course i do
2871861 have you ever observed evolution with your own eyes sir
2871862 since no one has ever observed the process of evolution at work and cannot even prove that this process is an on going endeavor are you not teaching your opinion sir are you now not a scientist but a preacher
2871863 to continue the point you were making earlier to the other student let me give you an example of what i mean
2871864 is there anyone in the class who has ever seen the professors brain
2871865 is there anyone here who has ever heard the professors brain felt the professors brain touched or smelt the professors brain no one appears to have done so so according to the established rules of empirical stable demonstrable protocol science says that you have no brain with all due respect sir
2871866 so if science says you have no brain how can we trust your lectures sir
2871867 now you accept that there is faith and in fact faith exists with life
2871868 of course there is we see it everyday it is in the daily example of mans inhumanity to man it is in the multitude of crime and violence everywhere in the world these manifestations are nothing else but evil

2871898 identificamos que a obesidade mesmo em idades precoces altera o controle metab lico do organismo e aumenta a possibilidade de desordens como a resist ncia insulina
2871899 o problema mais f cil de ser tratado quanto mais precocemente for verificado e envolve mudan a de modos de vida incluindo a pr tica de atividade f sica e a ado o de uma dieta equilibrada para redu o e controle do peso em alguns casos pode ser necess ria a inser o concomitante de terapia medicamentosa

2871907 certamente essa mol cula central no desenvolvimento de tumores e nossos resultados indicam que ela pode ser um marcador definitivo para o diagn stico de alguns tipos de c ncer
2871908 isso faz dessa enzima um marcador importante ela pode estar envolvida com o sistema imunol gico e com a fisiopatologia do c ncer
2871909 acreditamos que h mais formas de heparanases al m da 1 e da 2 poss vel que essas enzimas criem vias de sinaliza o espec ficas que resultam em uma regula o fina bastante espec fica da carcinog nese
2871910 a enzima pode ser um marcador interessante para permitir o diagn stico precoce dos tumores no caso do c ncer colo retal esses marcadores ainda n o existem
2871911 outro m todo o exame de sangue oculto nas fezes mas o grau de sensitividade desse exame baixo e a freq ncia de falsos positivos muito alta o ideal para realizar o diagn stico precoce com efic cia e sem procedimentos invasivos seria desenvolver um teste de sangue mas isso s ser poss vel com a descoberta de marcadores
2871912 a taxa de sobreviv ncia para pacientes com diagn stico precoce de 90 por outro lado ela diminui em 68 em pacientes com c ncer que j se espalhou para rg os adjacentes e para 10 em pacientes com met stase avan ada

2871920 beat this shit the fuck up and you get a new one with no rap
2871921 and worst of all i cant stop obsessing over david i thought i was over him but its all coming up again
2871922 then give it six more just keep throwin six months at it till it goes away stuff like this takes time
2871923 listen to me someday youre gonna look back on this moment of your life as such a sweet time of grieving youll see that you were in mourning and your heart was broken but your life was changing and you were in the best possible place in the world for it in a beautiful place of worship surrounded by grace take this time every minute of it let things work themselves out here in india
2871924 big deal so you fell in love with someone dont you see what happened the guy touched a place in your heart deeper than you thought you were capable of reaching i mean you got zapped kiddo but that love you felt thats just the beginning you just got a taste of love thats just limited little rinky dink mortal love wait till you see how much more deeply you can love than that heck groceries you have the capacity to someday love the whole world its your destiny dont laugh
2871925 and please dont laugh at me now but i think the reason its so hard for me to get over this guy is because i seriously believed david was my soul mate
2871926 he probably was your problem is you dont understand what that word means people think a soul mate is your perfect fit and thats what everyone wants but a true soul mate is a mirror the person who shows you everything thats holding you back the person who brings you to your own attention so you can change your life a true soul mate is probably the most important person youll ever meet because they tear down your walls and smack you awake but to live with a soul mate forever nah too painful soul mates they come into your life just to reveal another layer of yourself to you and then they leave and thank god for it your problem is you just cant let this one go its over groceries davids purpose was to shake you up drive you out of that marriage that you needed to leave tear apart your ego a little bit show you your obstacles and addictions break your heart open so new light could get in make you desperate and out of control that you had to transform your life then introduce you to your spiritual master and beat it that was his job and he did great but now its over problem is you cant accept that this relationship had a real short shelf life youre like a dog at the dump baby youre just lickin at an empty tin can trying to get more nutrition out of it and if youre not careful that cans gonna get stuck on your snout forever and make your life miserable so drop it
2871927 so miss him send him some love and light every time you think about him and then drop it youre afraid to let go of the last bits of david because then youll really be alone and liz gilbert is scared to eath of what will happen if shes really alone
2871928 us regulators are putting pressure on wall street banks to ensure they have enough liquid funds to withstand a financial shock as part of efforts to avoid a repeat of the

2871930 the usage scenario is evolving people use the iphone as a pc in your pocket its slightly mispositioned in the market
2871931 at christmas every teenager in america is going to want one
2871932 if anyone can turn this handset division around its sanjay jha
2871933 i think the engineering culture is a tremendous asset to motorola
2871934 i think the challenge is to make that culture stay in tune with the marketplace when its a problem is when it gets disconnected with the marketplace and my job is to keep it connected
2871935 he has strong carrier relationships and he knows the competition
2871936 he understands the wireless industry market and how to implement upcoming developments in hardware
2871937 hes going to have to get some top notch people
2871938 the guys there now are the same guys that have not produced product for several years
2871939 the most important thing they need is a sense of urgency
2871940 he may go to chicago and six months later decide that raising the level of urgency would come by moving at least part of the management team to the west coast
2871941 sanjay has very rigorous operational discipline and he knows the processes here that have been inconsistent
2871942 and i really feel that i can make a difference
2871943 whoever is the best guy will play i expect that to be me
2871944 i was still trying to play but it was like my shoulder didnt work right
2871945 my shoulder always worked great my entire life but after the injury the ball wouldnt go where i wanted it to
2871946 it was miserable coming to work it was a mess but you learn from it
2871947 im not sure anybody can go through all that turnover and not have it affect you
2871948 im sure its affecting him then you add shaun to it the maturation process for alex is over hes ready to go but all of a sudden its a battle
2871949 its good for alex to compete for this position hes never had to now he has a guy whos really pushing him how does he deal with it
2871950 your quarterback has to be your best competitor on the field
2871951 the way i look at it is the way its been presented to me the best quarterback is going to play
2871952 though its assumed matts the starter ive been told there are no other factors than who is the best player
2871953 im skeptical because ive heard that before and it hasnt come true
2871954 but at the same time im excited ill put my skills up against anybodys whoever is the best guy will play i expect that to be me
2871955 to have 64 quarterbacks start games last season is shocking
2871956 with the demise of nfl europa now how do you get guys ready to play with that position you have to play games to get better
2871957 its a preseason dilemma for coaches in terms of the competition part
2871958 i grew up in the school where you didnt have competition you tried to pick your guy and give him every possible snap tom brady dont share snaps in practice so how do you share snaps and find your quarterback ive never been involved with that
2871959 quarterback is the most difficult position to play in sports
2871960 with salary caps young top draft picks are forced to play sooner that can really hurt their confidence and set them back
2871961 with all the hirings and firings of head coaches and coordinators theres a lot of turnover
2871962 with all the blitzes and multiple coverages its all reactionary knowing where to go with the ball
2871963 as a coach for young quarterbacks you have to make it easy for them
2871964 arizona is the most fascinating quarterback situation in the league because i know kurt in his heart wants to be the guy and i know matt wants to win the job
2871965 its going to be interesting to see kurts approach is he going into it as a support system and a fan of matt leinart or is he approaching it that hell do anything to win it
2871966 theres a responsibility on kurt to be the best he can be and at the same time to help mentor matt
2871967 the joe montanas or steve youngs the good quarterbacks come all shapes sizes and arm strengths
2871968 the one thing that is common among the great ones is they find a way to get their team in the end zone
2871969 they think you can just dial 1 800 and get a quarterback
2871970 theres teams that have been trying to dial that number for 10 years
2871971 each year is a different year you go with whats going on at the time the year i stayed with rex he was our best option
2871972 we feel like we have a couple of options now were starting from scratch if rex ends up being our quarterback im going to support him the way i supported him before im supporting the best person for the job
2871973 i signed a contract knowing what the situation was going to be
2871974 it is what it is ill make the best of it theres nothing stopping me from having an unbelievable season i feel like if i go out there and do my job everything should take care of itself
2871975 they never came up with a solution for how to go about it when i signed my contract in march they said they were going to give us even reps whoever starts the first practice it didnt matter so they flipped a coin to show that they werent leaning one way or another
2871976 rex was our guy each year is a different year
2871977 if rex ends up being our quarterback im going to support him the way i supported him before im supporting the best person for the job
2871978 ive had a dramatic career so far whether its injury unbelievable games terrible games
2871979 ive been nfl player of the month ive won a playoff game in overtime at soldier field by completing a third and 10 pass ive been on the big stage the super bowl then three games later being benched
2871980 ive learned a lot to sum it up its more of a mind set
2871981 i just want to show everybody my teammates coaches and the people who picked me that i can play well at this level
2871982 i feel i play my best in an offense where i eliminate the gray being here with coach martz this offseason weve worked to do that
2871983 whether alex wins the job or shaun or even j t osullivan id like to think weve got three guys who can do the job
2871984 only once in 49ers history has this franchise had one quarterback play a whole season and that was alex two years ago thats from john brodie y a tittle joe montana steve young
2871985 it takes a special breed to be an elite quarterback
2871986 theres so much asked of you and the toughest thing to find in a quarterback is consistency and reliability
2871987 you dont find very many guys who can have the field awareness and play at a consistently high level
2871988 he just needs to be more consistent throwing the ball
2871989 from my first minicamp to otas organized team activities and the start of training camp ive seen growth with alex
2871990 mike martz took marc bulger one an undrafted guy and the other a sixth round pick and kurt was a two time mvp and marc a pro bowler and heres alex smith a former no 1 pick who i expect to outdo what both kurt and marc did in this offense
2871991 it has nothing to do with his talent its going to have to do with his maturity from what im hearing its happening
2871992 can that maturity sustain itself theres a huge gap in trust between the quarterbacks and vernon ill say it publicly i did not trust him
2871993 thats on vernon to earn the respect of the quarterbacks there if that happens he can be one of the better tight ends
2871994 vernon needs a coach like mike martz who will demand accountability
2871995 the best friend for a young quarterback is a good defense and a good run game
2871996 a young quarterback should be part of the success not the main ingredient
2871997 el puesto lo ganaron mal a mi me gusta ir a ganar de buena forma yo as no lo festejar a
2871998 la idea es tratar de comprenderlo como fruto de las transformaciones culturales y sociales en la argentina y no como la imposici n de alguien que viene de afuera o que les saca a otros

2872007 algunos herbicidas subieron de 300 a 700 pesos ante esta panorama ya no se puede mantener el valore fijado

2872010 unia tulkittaessa voidaan mietti miksi ihmisen uneen on tullut tiettyj mielikuvia ja n ytt m it tulkitsemista varten ei heti ensimm isen kaiveta esiin symbolisanakirjaa

2872012 v symyksen tilasta sek mahdollisista sairauksista tai l kinn st riippuen ihmiset katselevat unia tunnista kahteen joka y
2872013 yksi syy muistamattomuudelle on ettei ihminen l yd el myksille sanoja unet voivat olla pelkk v ri tai tunnelmaa joita ei voi muistaa eik kertoa
2872014 useammin syy on se ettei ihminen tule kysyneeksi heti her misen hetkell itselt n mit unia h n on n hnyt unia arvostava ihminen kysyy aamulla ensimm isen itselt n mit unia katselikaan y ll
2872015 p ivisin tiedostamme vain muutaman prosentin tapahtuvista asioista mutta unitasolla ihminen tunnistaa miksi on hermostunut suuttunut tai miksi mieli vaihtui kesken p iv n uni poimii k sittelyyn p iv n aikana mielt vaivaavia k sittelem tt j neit asioita
2872016 jos esimerkiksi p iv n aikana on tahtomattaan loukannut toista j asia painamaan mielt ja tulee uneen
2872017 ihminen k sittelee toisinaan unessa asioita maagisesti samaan tapaan entisaikojen ihmiset ovat tehneet kuvan ihmisest johon halusivat vaikuttaa ja pisteliv t t t neuloilla unessa ihminen pyrkii vaikuttamaan asioihin tekem ll asiasta kuvan ja vaikuttamalla siihen
2872018 halu tappaa tarkoittaa halua tappaa eli poistaa negatiivinen tunnetila unessa tehty tappo tarkoittaa usein tunteesta vapautumista
2872019 t m on unen ty skentelyn piilologiikkaa vaikkei uni loogista olekaan
2872020 jokainen painajainen on toki huolestuttava sill ne kuvaavat mielenrauhan menett mist sama asia saattaa vainota mielt ja tulla uudelleen mieleen p ivisinkin joka kerta kun ihminen hiljentyy
2872021 useimmat ihmiset tunnistavat mik asia painajaisen takana on unien tulkitsija voi omilla kysymyksill n auttaa l yt m n asiayhteyksi jossa ahdistus tulee esiin
2872022 uni saattaa piilotajuisesti koettaa auttaa oivaltamaan jonkin asian ihminen itse ei v ltt m tt ole saanut puettua sit sanoiksi joten uni saattaa tarjota oivaltamiseen lis h ystett
2872023 ihmisen olemisesta tunteista ja kokemuksista yli 95 prosenttia on piilotajuista unessa piilotajunta ty skentelee asioiden eteen ennen nukkumaanmenoa voi ruokkia unia ja tarjota niiden k sitelt v ksi ratkaisemattomia asioita
2872024 ihminen kulkee jatkuvasti edell itse n ja on huolissaan seuraavan viikon tai kuukauden tapahtumista
2872025 jos uni sattuu arvaamaan oikein me ihmiset olemme innoissamme ja sanomme n hneemme enneunen
2872026 ruumiillisella tasolla ihminen osaa paljon enemm n kuin p iv tajunnan tasolla meill on samankaltaisia kykyj kuin el imill jotka voivat aavistaa esimerkiksi maanj ristyksi unissa tulossa olevan voimakkaasti tunteisiin vaikuttavan tapahtuman oivaltaminen voi olla niin selke ett voidaan puhua oikeistakin enneunista

2872028 p iv ll voimme koettaa sovittaa kahta tai kolmea asiaa yhteen mutta uni voi mielleyhtym generaattorin avulla sovittaa yhteen kymmeni tai jopa satoja asioita mielleyhtym generaattori voisi verrata vaikkapa internetin googleen joka sekunneissa l yt useita tiettyyn sanaan liittyvi asioita ja juttuja
2872029 uni mahdollistaa nopean tiedonhaun tunnelmien ja aikaisempien kokemusten sek el mysten perusteella
2872030 sanojen kaksoismerkitykset tulevat unessa esiin kun uni sekoittaa kaksi merkityst toisiinsa tai yhdist ne esimerkiksi naisesta k ytetty haukkumasana kana saattaa unessa yhdisty naisena olemisen tunteeseen

2872036 ante la falta de materia prima en misiones hay un alto porcentaje de industrias que traen rollos de corrientes para su abastecimiento y ahora rentas multa por el pago de una tasa forestal sobre esta madera con lo que no estamos de acuerdo ya que est generando un gravamen a la madera que ingresa al aserradero cuando ste va a generar valor agregado y nuevamente terminar pagando ingresos brutos sobre el producto que comercialice
2872037 el panorama para la exportaci n de yerba es muy favorable cada vez estamos ganando m s mercados y los compradores que ten amos est n comenzando a solicitar mayores cantidades de yerba
2872038 tambi n hay otros mercados interesantes como arabia rusia y otros pa ses de europa y frica que de a poco van abriendo lugar para la infusi n
2872039 que las exportaciones marchen bien nos brinda grandes expectativas para conseguir m s ventas teniendo en cuenta que el consumo del mercado interno no ha crecido de manera importante en los ltimos a os los pa ses de otras partes del mundo pueden representar un nuevo espacio para la comercializaci n
2872040 tiene una larga tradici n en am rica latina donde lo religioso y lo pol tico han vivido juntos y no como en europa donde lo religioso y lo pol tico siempre han estado separados
2872041 se vio un mayor inter s tanto de grupos cat licos como evang licos por participar en la pol tica como as tambi n se vio un mayor inter s de los l deres de los partidos pol ticos en escuchar a los religiosos
2872042 a otros religiosos de otros credos y al conjunto de la oposici n
2872043 ese reconocimiento de poder vetar no es lo mismo a la hora de construir
2872044 misiones en la actualidad es la principal provincia forestal del pa s y adem s tiene una gran potencialidad futura esto es una realidad hoy la provincia ya tiene la industria instalada de celulosa tableros aserraderos y es muy superior a corrientes sumado a esto cuenta con toda la cadena de valor desarrollada recurso humano con experiencia con oficio y cuenta con empresas de servicios forestales que hoy prestan servicio a toda la regi n
2872045 est n limitando el crecimiento futuro del sector forestal de la provincia y est n alejando posibles inversores
2872046 el tema impositivo es un diferencial importante con respecto a corrientes donde la industria esta exento de muchos de ellos solo tiene la tasa municipal
2872047 se generan asimetr as dentro de la misma regi n que colocan en desventajas a las pymes forestales de misiones frente a sus competidores en este caso corrientes
2872048 lo que se quiso plantear es el potencial futuro que tiene corrientes para desarrollar esta actividad y de darse las condiciones que el gobierno de la vecina provincia est impulsando con la base forestal lograda muy similar a misiones promedio de 340 mil hect reas plantadas y la disponibilidad de tierras para crecer a n m s en masa forestal por m s de 2 millones de hect reas entre otras ventajas tributarias sin dudas es una provincia de gran potencial para la inversi n forestal

2872086 flat duo jets have made the kind of record that you listen to on a crackly am radio in your parked car on a dark 50s night the only thing to illuminate the road is two sets of headlights and the odd cherry of a cigarette flickering at the sides engines rev tires spin and a whole lot of gravel fires into the air beads of sweat rest on your brow to make speed demon history the dust clears and the only thing left behind for the crowd to see is the glimmering tailpipes of two hot rods shooting off into the distance like firecrackers
2872087 if you have known the jets for any length of time the first thing you will notice about lucky eye is the strings strings on a rockabilly record yeah strings what many do not will not realize is that dex has a much wider range than the psychotic rockabilly cat we have grown to know and love dex has style dex has grace dex has it all but has never been in a position to show it before
2872088 from the start flat duo jets shows became legendary for the fierce drumming of crow and the blazing guitar work of dex romweber the image of crow lanky and hovering over his tiny kit staring through his stringy black mane of hair toward dex as he looks to the ceiling briefly before ripping into the opening riffs of a tune etched into the setlist inside his head is indelible this was the flat duo jets what distinguished this band from other retro outfits is that the duo jets were not really retro at all while their music was certainly inspired by the rock n roll of the 1950s one got the feeling that nothing was calculated there was no marketing ploy on anyones part to capitalize on a trend or movement at the time dex and crow brought the music to life with such vitality and passion that the styles did not seem antiquated in their hands this was the genuine article
2872089 for the longest time i could not remember the name of this store

2872154 scientists are an opinionated bunch and they have given their thoughts on discoveries or events by speaking with journalists writing letters to journals authoring commentaries
2872155 blogs provide a lot more of that commentary but delivered almost instantaneously
2872156 science blogs are important because they continue to engage the attentive public in scientific topics
2872157 in the digital age information is found based on availability rather than accuracy if different interest groups start blogs that attack peer reviewed science and the scientific community does not engage in similar communication mode they will miss an important opportunity to educate the public
2872158 without misrepresenting scientific information on highly contested issues scientists must learn to actively frame information to make it relevant to different audiences
2872159 id end up giving fluff talks that play up economic advantages and how evolution contributes to medicine and id never talk about mechanisms and evidence again that sounds like a formula for disaster to me

2872168 ich wurde am freitag gegen 23 30 uhr von klappernden und scheppernden ger uschen aus dem schlaf gerissen
2872169 ein tosender sturm r ttelte an den h usern auf unserer terrasse flogen das mobiliar und andere gegenst nde durcheinander oder wurden einfach weggeweht der strom fiel aus berall in der dunkelheit h rte man das knacken von brechendem holz
2872170 wir gingen schlafen ohne zu ahnen wie schlimm die verw stungen waren
2872171 wir hatten gl ck gehabt unser haus war unversehrt ebenso unsere autos
2872172 aber in angrenzenden stra en waren viele h user fahrzeuge stra en von umgest rzten b umen schwer besch digt berall waren einsatzkr fte mit aufr umarbeiten besch ftigt arbeiteten mit motors gen die teils kreuz und quer umherliegenden b ume auf
2872173 the last thing i wanted to do was walk that guy
2872174 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2872175 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2872176 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2872177 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2872178 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2872179 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2872180 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2872181 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2872182 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2872183 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2872184 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2872185 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2872186 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

2872229 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2872230 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2872231 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2872232 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2872233 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2872234 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2872235 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2872236 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2872237 the water cube and the birds nest dont simply display chinas modernity they claim a jump into a digital sustainable mega scaled future
2872238 whoever is the best guy will play i expect that to be me
2872239 i was still trying to play but it was like my shoulder didnt work right
2872240 my shoulder always worked great my entire life but after the injury the ball wouldnt go where i wanted it to
2872241 it was miserable coming to work it was a mess but you learn from it
2872242 im not sure anybody can go through all that turnover and not have it affect you
2872243 im sure its affecting him then you add shaun to it the maturation process for alex is over hes ready to go but all of a sudden its a battle
2872244 its good for alex to compete for this position hes never had to now he has a guy whos really pushing him how does he deal with it
2872245 your quarterback has to be your best competitor on the field
2872246 the way i look at it is the way its been presented to me the best quarterback is going to play
2872247 though its assumed matts the starter ive been told there are no other factors than who is the best player
2872248 im skeptical because ive heard that before and it hasnt come true
2872249 but at the same time im excited ill put my skills up against anybodys whoever is the best guy will play i expect that to be me
2872250 to have 64 quarterbacks start games last season is shocking
2872251 with the demise of nfl europa now how do you get guys ready to play with that position you have to play games to get better
2872252 its a preseason dilemma for coaches in terms of the competition part
2872253 i grew up in the school where you didnt have competition you tried to pick your guy and give him every possible snap tom brady dont share snaps in practice so how do you share snaps and find your quarterback ive never been involved with that
2872254 quarterback is the most difficult position to play in sports
2872255 with salary caps young top draft picks are forced to play sooner that can really hurt their confidence and set them back
2872256 with all the hirings and firings of head coaches and coordinators theres a lot of turnover
2872257 with all the blitzes and multiple coverages its all reactionary knowing where to go with the ball
2872258 as a coach for young quarterbacks you have to make it easy for them
2872259 arizona is the most fascinating quarterback situation in the league because i know kurt in his heart wants to be the guy and i know matt wants to win the job
2872260 its going to be interesting to see kurts approach is he going into it as a support system and a fan of matt leinart or is he approaching it that hell do anything to win it
2872261 theres a responsibility on kurt to be the best he can be and at the same time to help mentor matt
2872262 the joe montanas or steve youngs the good quarterbacks come all shapes sizes and arm strengths
2872263 the one thing that is common among the great ones is they find a way to get their team in the end zone
2872264 they think you can just dial 1 800 and get a quarterback
2872265 theres teams that have been trying to dial that number for 10 years
2872266 each year is a different year you go with whats going on at the time the year i stayed with rex he was our best option
2872267 we feel like we have a couple of options now were starting from scratch if rex ends up being our quarterback im going to support him the way i supported him before im supporting the best person for the job
2872268 i signed a contract knowing what the situation was going to be
2872269 it is what it is ill make the best of it theres nothing stopping me from having an unbelievable season i feel like if i go out there and do my job everything should take care of itself
2872270 they never came up with a solution for how to go about it when i signed my contract in march they said they were going to give us even reps whoever starts the first practice it didnt matter so they flipped a coin to show that they werent leaning one way or another
2872271 rex was our guy each year is a different year
2872272 if rex ends up being our quarterback im going to support him the way i supported him before im supporting the best person for the job
2872273 ive had a dramatic career so far whether its injury unbelievable games terrible games
2872274 ive been nfl player of the month ive won a playoff game in overtime at soldier field by completing a third and 10 pass ive been on the big stage the super bowl then three games later being benched
2872275 ive learned a lot to sum it up its more of a mind set
2872276 i just want to show everybody my teammates coaches and the people who picked me that i can play well at this level
2872277 i feel i play my best in an offense where i eliminate the gray being here with coach martz this offseason weve worked to do that
2872278 whether alex wins the job or shaun or even j t osullivan id like to think weve got three guys who can do the job
2872279 only once in 49ers history has this franchise had one quarterback play a whole season and that was alex two years ago thats from john brodie y a tittle joe montana steve young
2872280 it takes a special breed to be an elite quarterback
2872281 theres so much asked of you and the toughest thing to find in a quarterback is consistency and reliability
2872282 you dont find very many guys who can have the field awareness and play at a consistently high level
2872283 he just needs to be more consistent throwing the ball
2872284 from my first minicamp to otas organized team activities and the start of training camp ive seen growth with alex
2872285 mike martz took marc bulger one an undrafted guy and the other a sixth round pick and kurt was a two time mvp and marc a pro bowler and heres alex smith a former no 1 pick who i expect to outdo what both kurt and marc did in this offense
2872286 it has nothing to do with his talent its going to have to do with his maturity from what im hearing its happening
2872287 can that maturity sustain itself theres a huge gap in trust between the quarterbacks and vernon ill say it publicly i did not trust him
2872288 thats on vernon to earn the respect of the quarterbacks there if that happens he can be one of the better tight ends
2872289 vernon needs a coach like mike martz who will demand accountability
2872290 the best friend for a young quarterback is a good defense and a good run game
2872291 a young quarterback should be part of the success not the main ingredient
2872292 this just adds to the drama of world series fever if both chicago teams end up in the world series people are going to start thinking somethings in the water
2872293 that would be mind boggling in this city oh boy
2872294 although it would be a whole lot more fun sitting in the stands having a beer
2872295 when you win games like these you forget about it as soon as you leave its the losses that stay with you you wonder what you could have done differently
2872296 this job is a lot more demanding than i thought it would be
2872297 and since the cubs havent won in a while it adds to the importance of the situation
2872298 everybody wants to come here because its such a fun city and when they do everyone wants to go out
2872299 hey ive still got to go to work in the morning it would be ok if i was 42 or 43 or even 50 but come on
2872300 i didnt change anything from yesterday but they made good pitches and i didnt see the ball too good
2872301 in my last at bat i turned to cardinals catcher
2872302 i told cubs gm jim hendry i still had something left in the tank
2872303 and my agent told him look if you dont like what you see in a couple of weeks release him
2872304 who would have thought wed both end up in chicago
2872305 this has exceeded all of my expectations to play in not only one of the greatest baseball cities st louis in the country but two is a dream come true

2872311 come on do you ever sit around talking football or basketball trivia
2872312 the only bad thing is if we played in the world series and lost to the cubs our fans would be so upset
2872313 if it meant getting to the world series and losing to the cubs and not getting there at all i think theyd prefer for us not go get there
2872314 my greatest regret was firing tony in 1986 the gm just didnt want him looking back i should have fired the gm now hes our broadcaster ken harrelson
2872315 you could have gone to any cemetery in the city

2872317 i know if we dont win another one at least weve won one
2872318 but id sure like to win another it wont be the same as the first one but when you win the first one it makes you hungry for another
2872319 i think as sports fans youre always going to feel sorry for the guy who finishes second thats human nature
2872320 but as a fellow golfer a fellow professional i feel sorry for garcia theres enormous pressure on his shoulders
2872321 theres guys that get a little bit fortunate they get in contention in a major and manage to get things going their way
2872322 that doesnt mean that im not on the right track so im looking forward to the challenges im just going to keep giving it my best and its just a matter of time
2872323 i was happy to see that at least this time it stayed on the green

2872342 floods and rain in spring and snow in winter all end up around the minarets
2872343 they are under threat and we have no resources to stop it
2872344 its ugly and excessive a slap in the face to roman citizens if it was up to me id demolish it completely but because we havent got the money this is not possible
2872345 we are a city enslaved by its past so hung up on being the home of art culture and creativity that it doesnt realize that in reality it is static and hostage to politicians archaeologists and intellectuals who talk and talk but do nothing
2872346 its disgusting they put modernity right next to these two ancient churches covering them
2872347 unfortunately this is a city where that kind of architecture just wont be accepted
2872348 this is a sad legacy of the previous administration imposed on citizens from the top by two mayors who wanted it at any cost
2872349 if rome carries on in this way it will become a beautiful necropolis beautiful for the japanese who come for the shopping and the americans who get drunk in the centre but it certainly wont be a modern city

2872369 das war nicht nur ein guter punktetag f r uns sondern hat auch gezeigt wie stark dieses team ist das ist mindestens genauso wichtig wir konnten im rennen das auto verbessern nur h tten wir noch ein paar weitere gelbphasen gebraucht aber immerhin haben wir am ende aus einem mittelm igen auto ein gutes auto machen k nnen
2872370 ich bin richtig stolz auf meine jungs wir waren das gesamte wochenende ber schnell und hatten dann ein wenig pech zuerst mussten wir ein untersteuerndes auto bek mpfen dann erlitten wir fr h einen reifenschaden trotzdem k mpften wir uns zur ck und holten ein gutes ergebnis
2872371 wir haben getan was wir tun mussten wir waren nicht ganz bei der musik haben uns aber ein top 10 resultat gesichert mehr konnte ich nicht pushen sonst h tte ich einen unfall gebaut und das w re ein worst case szenario gewesen wir machen weiter wir geben unser bestes und werden den chase schaffen
2872372 das war ein top 10 tag es h tte platz f nf werden k nnen oder aber auch nur platz 15 ein guter tag denn wir mussten am auto kaum ver nderungen vornehmen mir war nur wichtig dass wir dieses mal auch genug sprit an bord hatten ber platz zehn kann ich mich freuen
2872373 das auto war gut mit einer tendenz zum bersteuern das war das beste was ich heute geben konnte am schlimmsten ist es wenn die leute ber dich herfallen wenn du hart gegen sie k mpfst dann l ufst du gefahr dass du viele punkte verlierst daran habe ich heute dauernd gedacht
2872374 ein dezenter tag wir haben uns eng an unsere strategie gehalten aber leider gab es probleme mit dem rechten hinterrad das hat uns einige pl tze gekostet aber ich will mich nicht beschweren wir arbeiten hart und konstant und wir werden unsere top 10 form bald wieder erreichen
2872375 ich bin ganz zufrieden wenn ich bedenke dass ich vergangene nacht krank geworden bin und sogar ins hospital fahren musste ich habe hier und da ein paar fehler gemacht nach meinem dreher musste ich mich hinten einreihen und durch das feld kommen am ende habe ich langsam gemacht wieder ein top 20 resultat damit bin ich zufrieden

2872378 we have beaten china more than once in recent past and hence it was quite disappointing to lose to them we did not play to our potential today
2872379 it was not a match that we could not have won a win was quite a possibility but things did not go according to our plan and the pressure of performing in olympics the biggest stage got the better of us

2872395 hope you dont mind but i kinda oerheard your conversation
2872396 i come in peace i just wanted to help you out
2872397 i can do your make up oh and i have the most perfect yellow sundress
2872398 yellow looks great on you i cant even wear it because blondes cant wear yellow only brunettes can
2872399 blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted
2872400 howl ye for the day of the lord is at hand it shall come as a destruction from the almighty therefore shall all hands be faint and every mans heart shall melt and they shall be afraid pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth they shall be amazed one at another their faces shall be as flames behold the day of the lord cometh cruel both with wrath and fierce anger to lay the land desolate and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it
2872401 there is no peace saith the lord unto the wicked
2872402 their minds are continually dwelling upon something disagreeable which they fear may come or some difficulty may really exist which though small blinds their eyes to the many things that demand gratitude
2872403 there are those who are veritable gluttons for wretchedness they search for despair as bees search for honey they are never so happy as when they feel that they have a perfect right to be miserable they are never so miserable as when they feel duty bound to be happy
2872404 for the lord shall comfort zion he will comfort all her waste places and he will make her wilderness like eden and herdesert like the garden of the lord joy and gladness shall be found therein thanksgiving and the voice of melody
2872405 the spirit of the lord god is upon me because the lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord and the day of vengeance of our god to comfort all that mourn to appoint unto them that mourn in zion to give unto them beauty for ashes the oil of joy for mourning the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness that they might be called trees of righteousness the planting of the lord that he might be glorified
2872406 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose
2872407 my brethren count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire wanting nothing
2872408 those who mourn for sin are primarily intended it is sadness for sin
2872409 strong in the lord and in the power of his might
2872410 the righteous cry and the lord heareth and delivereth them out of all their troubles the lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit many are the afflictions of the righteous but the lord delivereth him out of them all
2872411 now i rejoice not in your grief but because the grief led to repentance for you sorrowed with a godly sorrow which prevented you from receiving injury from us in any respect
2872412 for mark the effects of this very thing your having sorrowed with a godly sorrow what earnestness it has called forth in you what eagerness to clear yourselves what indignation what alarm what longing affection what jealousy what meeting out of justice you have completely wiped away reproach from yourselves in the matter
2872413 the sorrow which god uses means a change of heart and leads to salvation it is the worlds sorrow that is such a deadly thing
2872414 crucify the son of god afresh and put him to an open shame
2872415 come close to god and he will come close to you realize that you have sinned and get your hands clean again realize that you have been disloyal and get your hearts made true once more as you come close to god you should be deeply sorry you should be grieved you should even be in tears your laughter will have to become mourning your high spirits will have to become heartfelt dejection you will have to feel very small in the sight of god before he will set you on your feet once more
2872416 the apostle john states the same truth in other terms
2872417 my own behavior baffles me for i find myself not doing what i really want to do but doing what i really loathe
2872418 it is an agonizing situation and who on earth can set me free from the clutches of my own sinful nature i thank god there is a way out through jesus christ our lord
2872419 depart from me for i am a sinful man o lord
2872420 whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be delivered
2872421 a great multitude which no man could number of all nations and kindreds and people and tongues
2872422 come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light
2872423 my heart is like the ocean it gets in the way
2872424 someday after mastering the winds the waves the tides and gravity we shall harness for god the energies of love and then for a second time in the history of the world man will have discovered fire
2872425 the motivations and actions of one type of knower the learned physician or surgeon and on one type of human cadaver the executed criminal to whom this sort of dissection was limited by statute and custom
2872426 the exemplary object of anatomy the ideal type of organ whose truth could be plumbed only by opening up the body
2872427 implicit link between the female body the body defined by its interior and dissection the technique by which that interior might be revealed
2872428 ideal of cooperation between women and medical men in the unraveling of the mysteries of the uterus
2872429 revised earlier notions of the relationship between viewer and corpse
2872430 this emphasized the distance between the male anatomist and his female object using gender difference to loosen the bonds of reciprocity and identification that had informed medieval notions of vision
2872431 these lice really give us the potential to learn how humans evolved when so many parts of our evolutionary history are obscure
2872432 lice also can serve as a model in understanding how parasites move from one species to another
2872433 human revolution involving the appearance of our own species with some of the behaviors new lithic industries bone and antler tools new social relations that can be detected in the archaeological record from that time
2872434 agriculture or more precisely sedentary communal living really did change the world
2872435 now considered as a subgroup within the autistic spectrum and the prevailing view is that it is a variant of autism and pervasive developmental disorder
2872436 try to get rid of me i try to make it as difficult as i can for them to find an excuse to get rid of me
2872437 during the summer i would rent out beach chairs and umbrellas and parked cars with my oldest brother
2872438 i have had lots of jobs which have lasted anywhere from 1 week to 1 year this was very frustrating to me i often needed to ask for help and never did because i did not want to look stupid
2872439 there is too much confusion when too many people are around
2872440 it is not that we do not work hard or have problems with being prompt not being on time or unwilling because we are not that at all it is that we are not very good at dealing with people in social situations
2872441 constantly running nt emulator when at work which is exhausting
2872442 i have no trouble doing the work i am always professional correct kind polite etc it doesnt help they notice that i dont have the same emotions they do
2872443 the most important rule at work is to get along with others at work i think that jobs usually are 80 social conversation lunch breaks chit chat and 20 work people with autism are better the other way around
2872444 i am very blunt very honest i just cant say the social niceties i choke
2872445 too much about what someone said and i try to figure it out in my head
2872446 too many questions or didnt ask enough or bothered the women whatever that meant
2872447 many people with autism are visual learners and thinkers like i am and often take things literally
2872448 so tired that i slip into robot voice or start toe walking without even realizing it
2872449 i had a breakdown shortly after that and my doctor ordered me to take a month off due to severe depression
2872450 there were no job coaches then if i had such support i could have worked until i were 65 or 70 and had a good job one which i could truly love
2872451 in my present job it is the best most of the coworkers are experts on how to handle people with autism they tell me to take my time if it is too much then stop and do the rest the next time i come in
2872452 i worry all day that i am doing something wrong and that the job coach will find out when he comes hack
2872453 job expectations are made clear need to put it in black and white in writing explained in the minutest detail
2872454 sometimes the job expectations are not too clear but usually when i tell them they make adjustments
2872455 i have a hard time getting started with my job unless i put everything in the order that they need to be in it takes me a long time to get started
2872456 i made a commitment that no matter where i worked i would not try to just figure out things on my own like i have always done and that no matter how stupid i may look or feel to anyone including myself i would ask questions
2872457 i dont want anyone i work with to know i try to make it as difficult as i can for them to find an excuse to get rid of me
2872458 i learned to be honest with nay employers about having autism if i need help i should ask for help get support help when you need it
2872459 in this day and age its best to disclose having autism the employer will get a heads up in case you have problems later
2872460 i wish i could disclose the information up front but i think that it would just prevent me from being hired because people dont know enough about it and are frightened
2872461 used to be gung ho about people on the spectrum letting potential employers know in advance of hiring
2872462 after hearing some of the horror stories of people doing so
2872463 employers were then able to make accommodations by giving me more time to learn my job
2872464 being on time attention to detail and with repetitive work i dont get bored also i am loyal and am not the type who will jump ship as quickly as others
2872465 society rewards employees for being like machines and do not recognize and adapt for uniqueness
2872466 nts have a certain form of mind wiring and recognize similar mind wiring in other nts which enables them to relate to one another instantly and easily they are not used to the difficult and sometimes painful interaction with non nts
2872467 we need to start a foundation with the cooperation of a local provider to provide meaningful jobs for those people with autism who are now relegated to jobs unworthy of their talents and training or cant find employment
2872468 why bring it up if you dont know all the details
2872469 i didnt know i was going to be quizzed next time ill prepare more thoroughly
2872470 oh dont be silly youd never last five minutes in a foreign country for goodness sake you get lost on the way to my parents house in machias
2872471 i am not sure but everyone is saying perceval left to go fight bluetooth on his own

2872473 i used to do drugs i still do but i used to also
2872474 i used to have a crack problem but now i dont smoke it anymore hardly ever that much
2872475 my heart is like the ocean it gets in the way
2872476 someday after mastering the winds the waves the tides and gravity we shall harness for god the energies of love and then for a second time in the history of the world man will have discovered fire
2872477 im gonna have to take you in with me son

2872484 peace i leave with you not as the world knows but rather a peace that passes all human understanding
2872485 much of what i had always considered a god show was really nothing more than a drake show
2872486 it is a very smart technique to destroy your own civilian object make it look as if its been bombed by the opponent blame it on the opponent and complain about how a big and huge russia attacks a small and week georgia
2872487 he hayes had recently finished work on a movie called
2872488 we both hit our knees and we were praying that was actually on a wednesday so when we got to church we had a good 30 people or more lay hands on her and it just you could feel god

2872524 everyone is in favor of free speech hardly a day passes without its being extolled but some peoples idea of it is that they are free to say what they like but if anyone says anything back that is an outrage
2872525 america is a country that can look after itself bla bla bla
2872526 they can dish it out but they cant take it
2872527 or lets say constantly talking to a black man this way
2872528 yous not happy yous susceptible yous hafta learn real men know how to laugh at jokes you not real man yet
2872529 why does it always smell like zyklon b when you enter a room
2872530 are you gonna behead me have you had your jihad juice wheres your camel
2872531 there is a big difference between being anti american and being critical of the united states
2872532 the fundamental role of anti americanism in europe in general and particularly among those on the left is to absolve themselves of their own moral failings and intellectual errors by heaping them onto the monster scapegoat the united states of america the u s is charged with all the evils real or imagined that afflict humanity from the falling price of beef in france to aids in africa and global warming everywhere the result is a widespread refusal to accept responsibility for ones own actions
2872533 anti americanism is hypocrisy at its finest you can spend your evening catching the latest episode of
2872534 it all boils down to the fact that knowledge and intelligence are two different issues rote memorization of world capitals does not equate intelligence
2872535 as an american please allow me to begin by asserting that our nation has had its strengths and its weaknesses its successes and its failures and its justices and injustices throughout history and continuing into the present although i sense much patriotism for my homeland i recognize our need for humility to understand that our country is not above questioning or reproach but is rather under the same standards as all other nations of the world i would simply like to ask those who view our country from afar to maintain a balanced perspective and realize too that there exists good and bad in america both in terms of its domestic society and politics as well as in its relations with other nations whilst there may be growing anti americanism in the united kingdom i do not believe such sentiment to be reciprocated on our side of the atlantic i viewed a recent survey that indicated most americans view england positively and never have i seen the flag of your country or any other foreign land for that matter burned in the streets of our cities clearly we as american citizens have not meant to be your enemies
2872536 as someone who takes human rights seriously im appalled by the lack of sympathy the left feels toward the victims of any regime other than the bush administration lets shout it to prisoners everywhere if youre not harmed by an american your suffering doesnt count
2872537 ambivalence antipathy and resentment toward and about the united states have comprised an important component of european culture since the american revolution at the latest thus way before america became the worlds mr big the proverbial eight hundred pound gorilla and a credible rival to europes main powers particularly britain and france while the politics style and discourse of the bush administration and of george w bush as a person have undoubtedly exacerbated anti american sentiment among europeans and fostered a heretofore unmatched degree of unity between elite and mass opinion in europe they are not cause indeed a change to a center left administration in washington led by a democratic president would not bring about its abatement let alone disappearance
2872538 is euro disney land a threat to the french culture if french culture can be squashed by mickey mouse or more exactly by simply moving mickey geographically it would have to be disturbingly fragile
2872539 anti americanism is the only face of xenophobia still broadly accepted in europe
2872540 americans find themselves damned either way if they remain within their own borders they are isolationist hicks who are shirking their responsibilities if they intervene they are rapacious imperialists
2872541 the british find it very difficult to come to terms with the loss of their global dominance we felt a deep sense of hurt and loss we used to run the world and we dont anymore so in order to palliate that insecurity we tend to run ourselves down too much and were also snooty about the people who do run the world
2872542 it is tragic that anti american ideas are so easily passed through rumour while reconciliatory ideas and notions must be backed up with catalogues of evidence before they are even considered purely because of the fact that it is so much easier to hate than to keep an objective open mind
2872543 other common anti american objections are ignorance and stupidity in dealing with these two i have no reason to suspect that the average american is any less intelligent than the average person from anywhere else one trait i have noticed is that other cultures are generally much more ashamed of any deficit in the intellect of the individual especially ours the british and as such will make a much greater attempt to hide it if all cultures bar one are scared of looking stupid and take action to prevent that happening then that one remaining culture is inevitably going to be lumbered with that image
2872544 we became not a melting pot but a beautiful mosaic different people different beliefs different yearnings different hopes different dreams
2872545 most of the anti americanism these days stems from plain old nationalistic jealousy by a lot of countries that are born of insecurity about their own place in the world and their painful self awareness of their own failings and shortcomings like the kids in the next block who are jealous of the boy who has a better bicycle or a newer fancier skateboard phuque em all
2872546 europeans like the rest of the world hate america and americans but love our aid when in distress and our soldiers to die for their countries you need to work live and pay taxes from this side of the atlantic to understand our vision of europe and the rest of the world
2872547 unjustified hatred of americans there is much unjustified hatred in the world there is unjustified hatred of the usa much of this arises from the victimisation complex that sweeps much of mankind whoever is in charge whoever is powerful or successful will also be hated this immature hatred often evaporates quickly with a little reason or thought there are some some invalid unjustified criticisms the most widespread hate is the hate by people the world over who fall victim to their own shortcomings and want a scapegoat
2872548 usa citizens are not given world news in the same way as most the other developed nations
2872549 despite the usas dominance of mass media it is frequently only the pro usa self congratulatory messages that seem to arrive in europe the usa citizens criticism and disbelief of their own government is not apparent which gives the overall impression that americans are either gullible ignorant or honestly uncaring
2872550 if a person outside of american culture is a hateful person they may actively hate and verbally attack america
2872551 i think it is best when faced with people from other nations to treat them as individuals
2872552 sometimes the caliber of a nation is found not in why it is liked but rather in why it is not
2872553 everyone is in favor of free speech hardly a day passes without its being extolled but some peoples idea of it is that they are free to say what they like but if anyone says anything back that is an outrage

2872578 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2872579 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2872580 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2872581 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2872582 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2872641 there is no limits for promotion of iran and indonesia relations and cooperation in all fields
2872642 we now come to the previously untold story of how the sup was itself infiltrated by a humble truck driver who was later selected to attend a specialist course at the lenin institute in moscow
2872643 so i decided to get even i had no firm plans but i knew the union was run by the sup and so i thought that if i can get in then sometime down the track ill get even it was as simple as that
2872644 talents were recognised with selection for further training in moscow from 29 october 1983 to february 12 1984 he went with three other sup members and one month later they were joined by bill
2872645 on arrival in moscow we were quarantined for medical checks over four days and given new identities i became john van jim thompson became jimmy brown allan ware allan wolf peter devlin peter jay
2872646 there were 3 500 communists from all over the world being trained five and half days a week according to the requirements of their home country
2872647 13 week course was that soviet leader and former kgb chief yuri andropov had initiated a strategy for taking a social democratic country out of the western alliance by utilising the
2872648 which when applied within the trade unions the peace movement and the labour party worked as intended he recalled
2872649 our role was to influence and steer the peace movement not by taking the top jobs but to be done in such a way that the top people in the various peace groups were seen as reasonably responsible by the average new zealander
2872650 so our training consisted of being able to train lesser known communists secret members sympathisers and fellow travellers to take over these groups unite them but never take the leading roles my own role was as a nuts and bolts technician
2872651 tens of thousands of soviet supporting marxists and fellow travellers moved into cnd
2872652 today of course we are not strong enough to attack to win we shall need the element of surprise the bourgeoisie will have to be put to sleep so we shall begin by launching the most spectacular peace movement on record there will be electrifying overtures and unheard of concessions the capitalist countries stupid and decadent will rejoice to cooperate in their own destruction they will jump at another chance to be friends as soon as their guard is down we shall smash them with our clenched fist
2872653 yes george most of the peace movement are pro soviet
2872654 marxists and religionists are both anti reason two sides of the same deluded coin
2872655 idf 10 palestinians 1 its idf 128 palestinians 7 thats nearly double the 10 1 fuck thats nazi

2872658 cowardice asks the question is it safe expediency asks the question is it politic vanity asks the question is it popular but conscience asks the question is it right a position that is neither safe nor politic nor popular but because conscience tells him it is right

2872665 sam buchanan doesnt say anything on the subject so ill just make up something about him that fits my prejudices
2872666 judge people on what they are doing rather than their political ideology
2872667 go to a battery farm take a photo of yourself with several thousand caged chicken or sow crate pigs and then you are allowed to have an opinion on animal rights with some substance to it it is criminal the way animals are treated in this country until the law changes bricks are the least the animal abuse industry has to worry about
2872668 mah your ignorance is profound there are many many jews who support animal rights and you can quite happily practice kosher while being a vegetarian or a vegan as indeed a number do
2872669 its criminal to lecture how people like you should have government to change the diets of people whom have had it for ever since the founding of the religion
2872670 it is morally justified to kill an animal to save a human as in putting down a pit bull terrier it is therefore morally justified to sacrifice animals to save human lives through medicine
2872671 even the nazi dictator adolf hitler promoted this radical veganization of german society to incite non jewish germans against german jews and other european jews

2872679 the capitalists will one day sell us the rope that we will use to hang them
2872680 what a bunch of gutless cowards insinuating and making up shit like that about trevor
2872681 fantastic post anon 10 23am agree with you entirely and its one of the reasons why this act voter supporter does not support the china fta
2872682 obama is an excellent candidate but its not about obama or clinton
2872683 its about beating the extreme right wing at the end of the day theyre just playing their roles
2872684 if we were to run our own candidate this year
2872685 some people would vote for him taking away votes from clinton or obama and mccain might jump in that would be terrible
2872686 its better then it used to be in my parents generation
2872687 but its still very taboo the bush administration puts communists and fascists together
2872688 i think it was clear that most people were excited about obama rather than other candidates
2872689 i think that he does represent a certain kind of change or it seems so
2872690 the right will throw all the dirt they can find in this election
2872691 harold spoke strongly against the war he was one of the more progressive legislators i was very impressed that he spoke in the rain and grateful to him for coming and giving our rally greater impact
2872692 as a practical politician i would seek to build a coalition of black and white campaign workers throughout the city the issue would not be anti race but anti greed and anti corruption
2872693 there really wasnt anybody else who could pull that part of the coalition together
2872694 the support for washington in the african american community grew quickly literally you could feel it you could cut it with a knife it was so thick
2872695 it was really a period of engagement that was quite astonishing
2872696 it was understood that if stability was going to be produced and progress and building support was going to be maintained from election to election an independent operation was needed so that he wouldnt have to depend on the regular democratic party machine
2872697 we are a multiethnic multiracial multilanguage city and that is a source of stability and strength
2872698 did diffuse that sentiment there was no longer fear of african americans in positions of power by the time his regime ended
2872699 he was successful in diffusing that racial animosity but not successful enough by 1987 to win over a majority of white ethnic voters
2872700 he opened city hall to not only african americans but also latinos women gays asians everybody that had been locked out
2872701 it is now just a part of the city fabric
2872702 absent harold it wouldnt have happened harold did it and it stuck
2872703 its a theory that all you got to do is embrace and these tyrants act thats not how they act thats not what causes them to respond
2872704 sitting down at the table having your picture taken with a tyrant such as raul castro for example lends the status of the office and the status of our country to him
2872705 bush is a tyrant and oil tycoon who is like john key and trev a climate skeptic and crypto fascist
2872706 tyrants like people that launch illegal wars engage in torture hold secret trials lie to the public illegally spy on their people etc
2872707 absolutly anon which is why you supported the overthrow of saddam hussien
2872708 i dont think its that bad but you dont know until you get the mri the good thing is it wasnt broken on the x ray so thats the positive thing but i have to wait and see with the mri to see if theres any damage in there

2872721 we wont know for sure for a number of hours but right now he feels good

2872726 there were two bombings one at the kojori military base and another on mt makhata as far as i know there are no casualties

2872728 it is the most surreal world crisis i could ever imagine

2872759 unless we act quickly the gap between the haves and the have nots will grow uncontrollably exacerbating existing inequalities and condemning millions more people to poverty
2872760 now it is clearer than ever that the only way to end the gross inequalities that have condemned more than a billion people to linger in poverty is through a massive redistribution of power assets and opportunities

2872783 he forgot that it was the army that brought him to power
2872784 its the army that brought an end to dictatorship in 2005 and today its once again she that brings an end to dictatorship to nepotism to chaos and disorder
2872785 what they dont see is that sidi abdallahi was only a mascot and never had power people talk about mauritania being a democracy but mauritania has always been led by the military this coup comes as no surprise democracy does not exist it is only on paper in daily life sidi could not realise his campaign promises
2872786 at this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond south ossetia into abkhazia
2872787 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected
2872788 a return by the parties to the status quo of august the 6th
2872789 i condemn russias aggressive actions and reiterate my call for an immediate ceasefire
2872790 for many years i have warned against russian actions that undermine the sovereignty of its neighbours
2872791 commitment to the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of georgia
2872792 those who have been supplying arms to georgia i believe they should feel part of the blame for the loss of life of civilians including many russian citizens and peacekeepers i think those who have been appeasing mr saakashvilis aggressive intentions and who helped create a feeling of impunity among the georgian leadership should think twice
2872793 so far each step in the caucasus drama has put the conflict on a yet higher plane the next step will no longer be just about the caucasus or even europe remember the guns of august
2872794 you have found him guilty of offenses that have made our world extremely unsafe and dangerous
2872795 the government asks you to deliver a sentence that will absolutely keep our society safe from him your sentence should say the united states will hunt you down and give you a harsh but appropriate sentence if you provide material support for terrorism
2872796 your sentence will be their justice your work is our justice and you shouldnt flinch from it
2872797 godspeed mr hamdan i hope the day comes that you are able to return to your wife and daughters and your country

2872801 contributing to the innovation and productivity gains required for long term economic development and growth
2872802 producing professionals for both national and local labour market needs
2872803 any effective and sustainable strategy for higher education needs to be founded on a recognition that universities will behave as enterprises in a market
2872804 take account of the growing role of the private sector as well as recognising the increasing private activities of all universities
2872805 today there are around 150 private providers operating in australia and the public universities receive less than half of their revenue from the commonwealth income from student fees and charges now represents an average 39 percent of institutional income indeed the term public university now refers more to the historical circumstances at the time of their foundation rather than the nature of institutional funding
2872806 overall education export earnings in 2007 were a12 5 billion us11 1 billion making it australias largest services export and third largest export sector behind coal 20 8 billion and iron ore 16 1 billion
2872807 many in the sector claim that reductions in public funding have forced universities to seek alternative revenue to the point where there is now an over reliance on international student fees
2872808 in order to enhance our research links and to extend global regard for the quality of the australian higher education system
2872809 as has been the case in many other industries exposed to similar pressures

2872811 i was arrested because i could not produce my national identity card i just forgot to bring it and i pleaded with the police asking them to allow me to go but they refused i was released only after three days when my mother produced my identity card the police threatened to detain me for 14 days the next time being a tamil in this country is a curse
2872812 i commute from dehiwela usually most workers come by the train as the train fare is less than the bus fare but last week it was very inconvenient the police ordered all passengers to disembark and everyone was checked top to bottom
2872813 the government said that holding the saarc summit was a great benefit for the country and the people but people were harassed like criminals and they did not get any benefit from the summit how can those countries help us when they have failed to resolve any problems for the people of their own countries only government cronies made money from the various contracts like building repairing road cleaning painting walls and fences and catering
2872814 as part of the security operation 30 police officers were stationed inside the bank building where we were working everyone who entered the bank was checked special identity cards were issued for the employees of several bank branches
2872815 for years we have experienced restrictions on free movement because of the war against the ltte but in the past week peoples movements in the city were almost completely restricted colombo city was really a police military camp it is said that billions were spent on the summit but what have those leaders to offer for the people in sri lanka or in this region they have no solution for the war in sri lanka or unemployment and poverty
2872816 now most parts of colombo city have been declared high security zones
2872817 we did not run our bus for three days from friday to monday the police used some of our buses to block roads without any payment who will pay us those losses because of the war we face many problems even threats to our lives oil prices and everything else are going up two months ago we spent 4 200 rupees for fuel each day now it has risen to more than 6 000 rupees the government asks people to be patient until the war is over how many years has this war been going on and how many years will it continue no one knows the poor have to pay for it
2872818 while the government spends a huge amount of money on the war its full burden has been put on the people by increasing prices and introducing new taxes now the government is going to introduce a number of environmental taxes including a 2 percent tax for mobile phones
2872819 when workers resist and fight to defend their living conditions the government accuses them of supporting terrorism when workers staged a one day strike demanding a salary increase last month they were branded as supporters of the ltte and disrupters of the governments war efforts
2872820 i am 56 and i have cultivated rice paddy for over 30 years
2872821 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2872822 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2872823 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2872824 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2872825 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2872826 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2872827 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2872828 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2872853 some poems dont rhyme and some stories dont have a clear beginning middle and end life is about not knowing having to change taking the moment and making the best of it without knowing whats going to happen next
2872854 i told you that whatever you command me to do i will obey you
2872855 of course you will youre the chamberlain of my keep
2872856 what is all this about scorpius youve been with me for years today suddenly youre dropping bombs and playing true confessions
2872857 i told you i may as well be your slave like he is
2872858 my heart is the heart of one who would serve you like a slave
2872859 much better now my grateful chamberlain what do you mean with these offers of slavery and replacements for my dionysian ball
2872860 i have spent the last few years arranging your entertainments for these balls my lady supervising them down to the last detail keeping a watchful eye as they took place i am satisfied that im quite familiar with what pleases you
2872861 if were unable to stage a grand spectacle i offer myself as a sort of consolation prize
2872862 i dont think you have it in you to be a slave
2872863 to begin with i just corrected you for looking directly at me and here you are doing exactly the same thing slaves never look at me
2872864 if i were to tell my real slave here to look at me he would not
2872865 if i said i order you to look at me he would then do so
2872866 you wouldnt know the first thing about what it takes to be a slave
2872867 you manage my household and you do it well ive never had too much to complain about
2872868 i dont like waiting for an answer when ive asked a question
2872869 vanaf dat ik klein was droomde ik ervan om de beste van de wereld te worden
2872870 nu kan ik als ik ouder ben in elk geval zeggen dat ik minimaal een dag nummer een ben geweest dat neemt niemand me meer af ik sta in de geschiedenisboeken en dat is een geweldige prestatie
2872871 i wish i could have got some contract stuff done earlier but thats the way it worked out
2872872 now were starting up and this is where everything begins for me im going to work hard move through the best i can and then try to help this organization out
2872873 its nothing like getting out there and being able to walk on the field and see what these guys get to play on every day
2872874 everybody in the park knew we were going to be teammates hopefully someday
2872875 i knew that im sure he knew that it was just kind of the heat of the moment we were still trying to win for our college programs
2872876 the celestial poles change as the axis of the earth moves traveling with the earths precessional motion the north celestial pole assumes different positions relative to the constellation as this process goes on different stars will become the north star
2872877 even if we do have one we would prefer to hold it behind closed doors
2872878 the most general definition of the word is to be independent from the mainstream the word has become most often associated with a subculture defined by its associated music fashion behavior and beliefs indie culture is a lifestyle which follows social trends that are considered to consciously deviate from the mainstream one common belief within indie culture is anti conformity
2872879 early in the season our pitching kept us in games and we found ways to win but right now were not playing well and were not swinging the bats great we have maybe one key at bat per game one at bat to do something and we havent capitalized on it
2872880 its great we got off to a good start and played that well but unfortunately it created some unrealistic expectations outside the organization
2872881 that said theres no reason we cant bounce back the next seven weeks and play the way we did in the first half
2872882 truthfully the results are nasty but i feel like i made some very good improvements today with my stuff
2872883 im going to keep fighting obviously i have to start getting outs and put up zeros you can talk all day about feeling better
2872884 i know ive been in the league 23 months and the first 22 were pretty solid the last month was the first time ive experienced prolonged poor results and it will turn around im probably not going to see late innings when weve got a guy whos thrown 37 scoreless innings i understand that at the same time i expect that within a month from now sept 10 i will have righted my ship
2872885 more than anything its coincidence we played really really well the early part of the season and we expected to be a lot better than this
2872886 obviously the biggest thing is the offense we havent swung the bats well its been really bad its not fun at all
2872887 the record for the largest firework display consisted of 66 326 fireworks and was achieved by macedos pirotecnia lda in funchal madeira portugal on 31 december 2006
2872888 i have really focused hard on the majors the last two years
2872889 i have turned up to other events and unless i get into contention it feels like a race or a sprint
2872890 where as a major feels like a marathon i feel like i can be patient and take my time i love the feeling of knowing that it is going to come down to the back nine and who can do it under pressure on the last nine holes
2872891 i am a great believer in making it your own responsibility whether you win or dont win i knew i was playing catch up and those are the moments that change tournaments when you take shots on and they come off and you have to do it on the back nine you are not going to win any other way
2872892 i had a discussion with my trainer back home and it was possible i was dehydrated
2872893 so that gave me something to focus on i focused on re hydrating myself whether that was the cause or not i dont know it might have just been tiredness
2872894 but at least i had something tangible that i could pin it on and try to put effort into it and it gave me the belief that if i get my hydration right my co ordination would come back
2872895 i have probably been the leading golfer in europe for close to six years
2872896 it is a big step to move up and start competing on a different level ive got tiger woods and ive got phil mickelson ahead of me
2872897 it is a long way to catch tiger at the top but i know that the only way of focusing on doing that is to focus on controlling what i can do i cant control tiger or phil i am going to continue to strive to improve
2872898 mungkin tapi aku belum bisa menangkap sepenuhnya apa yang kaumaksud

2872901 aku mulai menyimpan di rekeningmu bukan simpanan uang tapi kontak kukenalkan kau pada orang ini dan orang itu aku mengatur perjanjian perjanjian selama tidak melanggar hukum kau tahu kau berutang budi padaku tapi aku tak pernah minta apa pun darimu
2872902 persis suatu hari aku akan minta tolong padamu dan kau bisa saja mengatakan tidak tapi kausadari bahwa kau berutang budi padaku kaulakukan apa yang kuminta aku terus membantumu dan orang orang lain melihat kau orang yang tahu membalas budi jadi mereka pun mulai menyimpan di rekeningmu selalu dalam bentuk kontak karena dunia ini hanya terdiri atas kontak tidak ada yang lain lagi mereka pun pada suatu hari akan minta bantuan padamu dan kau akan menghormati dan membantu orang orang yang pernah membantumu dan pada saatnya jaringanmu akan melebar ke seluruh penjuru dunia kau akan kenal semua orang yang perlu kaukenal dan pengaruhmu akan tumbuh semakin besar
2872903 berteman berbagi kebaikan dengan harapan langsung maupun tidak pada suatu saat kebaikan itu akan kita terima kembali

2872906 we fought our hardest we tried to make it a good game i think we lost to a strong team
2872907 while we believe the break up of baa would improve competition and therefore benefit airlines a ryanair bid would likely come under microscopic scrutiny from a competition perspective as it is ryanairs largest base

2872922 people have come to the conclusion that the closer he is to wanting to obtain power the more difficult others will make it for him to achieve that
2872923 a lot of people are very tired after living through the first sodomy trial which had a chilling effect on the country even until today people thought it was blatant political manoeuvering
2872924 the new sodomy charges against anwar ibrahim are all a political game because he is now a real threat to the prime minister
2872925 anwar was cleared of all the sodomy charges before so what are they trying to prove now we have all grown up in the last 10 years and people are not so stupid to just accept all these things blindly
2872926 it looks like the government is out to fix him again everyone knows that the charge against him is nothing but a lie

2873100 and i treat them for free the hospital gets paid but i dont
2873101 maybe someday well have national health insurance and then they wont be screwed so much
2873102 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2873103 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2873104 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2873105 we cannot just go out alone on this and talk and act unilaterally we dont have much impact i believe in terms of our unilateral declarations anymore with the administrations approach to the world
2873106 were alarmed by this entire situation and every escalatory step is a further problem
2873107 if those russian ships leave that port in the black sea and if ukraine decides that it is not going to allow those ships back into that port that is a potentially much greater conflagration involving a wider regional area
2873108 right now our focus is on working with both sides with the europeans and with a whole variety of international institutions and organizations to get the fighting to stop
2873109 that scream is the exhaustion and the pain of living life in this world
2873110 in that scream is a defiance that its not going to be the last word
2873111 where did it all come from what keeps it all running smoothly
2873112 but im more than confident that none of you will be able to because the basis of your argument is already proven to be flawed

2873116 that year or six months or what have you i lived in west texas
2873117 i knew that i had the opportunity to get the putt in first
2873118 that was important i knew if i holed it i probably would win the pga if i missed sergio would probably win the pga
2873119 so it was down to that and i hit a lovely putt i read it exactly how i wanted it and it did exactly what i expected
2873120 i think i was willing them into the hole at that stage
2873121 the good thing about it is i felt good out there
2873122 i felt like i played well i definitely feel like i played well enough to win but unfortunately it didnt happen
2873123 i totally was nervous about being around older players the speed they play at and how hard they hit the ball i really didnt want to look bad
2873124 it gets real intimidating when you see morgan hit the ball for the first time
2873125 you need to hide it and let it out during the water breaks if you make a mistake dont think about it just keep pushing through
2873126 its about working together and being part of the team
2873127 have fun and remember these are going to be your teammates
2873128 that was great but we were lucky to win the first game
2873129 obviously melhuse had a lot of confidence and a good idea of how they were trying to pitch him

2873131 thats not going to cut it at the major league level

2873133 carlton this is why you cant see my blog when i write isnt about you its about me if i didnt write about something its because i a didnt feel like it b didnt have the time when it happened and it didnt seem like i could squish it in
2873134 not seeing you had helped me not be infatuated with you

2873140 sorry im not sure which team it is riding in the grey and green jersey
2873141 i dont know why the italians are celebrating they came what third
2873142 its important they are able to go to work in our community and fill the need
2873143 the community had a lot of feedback and that is what weve used to design our program
2873144 y por qu cobran si la calle es p blica
2873145 haha cool and fun deal plus i love the turkey so its a win win
2873146 ive got a confession to make i dont like midcap stocks and i dont feel too bad about it because neither do a lot of other portfolio theorists its nothing personal the problem is that theyre neither fish nor fowl
2873147 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
2873148 savings needed to fund health insurance and health care expenses in retirement
2873149 because the guidelines are intended to be general individuals who want to replace greater amount of the pr retirement income or have specific goals should consult with a planner who can create a customized strategy finally we hope that by the end of the summer morningstar ibbotson assoc will have developed an online calculator to on their and fpa web site
2873150 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
2873151 the great thing about facebook is that we will be able to foster relationships beyond our customers trips
2873152 the most memorable part of travel holidays is the people you meet along the way through the power of facebook our guests will be able to find new friends made while on vacation and plan future trips to create more memories
2873153 last night felt very easy it was such a relaxed swim this morning i just didnt have it at the end
2873154 i think i forced my stroke and it fell to pieces a bit
2873155 two years ago i had decided to add a ccf fund pcrix to my asset allocation but i was not able to add it then with required minimum without affecting the overall desired allocation in the portfolio
2873156 1 you have waited two years whats the hurry wait another year and go without the insurance really ccf being so high now its likely not providing much insurance anyway
2873157 wenn es so nicht klappt dann musst du gezwungener ma en die links per hand anklicken
2873158 the first game is a big one it takes the pressure off and now we can focus on the next game and italy and the rest of the stretch run
2873159 there somewhat is relief the day is over we overcame so much it was all kind of a whirlwind
2873160 and we got the nerves out and the mistakes out
2873161 ive been doing it so well in training i think i just pulled so hard and i over rotated

2873170 some situations take courageous decisions with regard to the political future
2873171 sometimes there are democratically elected or semi democratically elected leaders who do things which create grave problems for their countries
2873172 so sometimes those leaders should contemplate how useful they have become to their people
2873173 for me it confirms that what the russian federation is seeking through this military aggression and invasion is to change the democratically elected georgian government
2873174 the days of overthrowing leaders by military means in europe those days are gone
2873175 this statement ambassador is absolutely unacceptable particularly from the lips of the permanent representative of a country whose actions we are aware of including with regard to civilian populations in iraq and afghanistan and serbia
2873176 im not going to recycle a supermarket tabloids anonymously sourced story
2873177 tend to pick up stories from the national enquirer with tongs
2873178 i think at that point we should have earlier than we did told readers and viewers what we knew and we didnt know
2873179 t he fact that these unreported stories without exception work to the detriment of democrats is apparently a grand coincidence

2873208 i dont think ive ever scripted 10 plays in a row since peewee football i know we never did at wisconsin or at the philadelphia eagles
2873209 thats a big area of improvement that we need to see this year
2873210 we obviously do plenty of work on running the football here in training camp and one of the things that our team needs to be better at is throwing the football protecting adrian and his growth
2873211 obviously we needed to take a look at all those protections and route running and i dont need to see peterson run a zone another time
2873212 there were some things that were pleasant and some things that need work but thats what its all about you just can point to the obvious and weve got things to come back and work on the offense did some good things but defensively we werent doing much
2873213 he was consistent and i thought he had a good spot on most of those throws i thought he obviously knew what was happening to him and you just want to see that standard of performance over and over again
2873214 well ive said all the way along that defensive end
2873215 we had the fumble that caused a touchdown for them that cost seven points and tight end jim kleinsasser had that false start which we ended up overcoming for a touchdown but we can play more disciplined and certainly improve on that end too
2873216 i was pleased with where were at in the return game and the coverage game as well
2873217 i thought they did some good things and great stuff for our young guys to teach from we didnt have any first teamers at all on any of our kick teams because you want to look at those younger guys so you kind of hold on and hope they do well and they actually gave a pretty good accounting but a lot of things to correct
2873218 what they get with me is a proven conservative leader who has the courage to fight for change
2873219 if washington wasnt broken if the republican party here in our state was thriving id probably stay in business
2873220 i think the old guard political establishment is backing my opponent because i think he better reflects their values
2873221 but they are the same people who led this republican party to where it is today
2873222 its an important position its a management position it does not make policy
2873223 what the voters of the sixth congressional district want is the most qualified person serving in congress at a time when this country faces horrendous challenges
2873224 there is not a single republican member of congress who has served in iraq
2873225 and i want to be the one to change that
2873226 its more than a military solution thats needed in iraq
2873227 its a political solution i know this from my experience over there and i would bring that expertise to washington
2873228 i got into this race originally because i thought that republicans had gone astray from government issues like taxes and spending
2873229 the last 16 years ive been building businesses creating jobs meeting payrolls solving real world problems voters want real world solutions not more politicians going to washington
2873230 if his dad wasnt bill armstrong he might be in fourth place
2873231 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2873232 cant believe i got caught 2006 can you read 2006 ancient history i just know theres a statute of limitations on disloyalty judas iscariot got a bum rap
2873233 although john believes he should stand alone and take the consequences of his action now when the door closes behind him he has his family waiting for him
2873234 waiting to pull out every one of those well coiffed hairs wrap it around his tiny little penis and pull real hard
2873235 i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness
2873236 how do you spell liaison anyway dang cant say affair cant say poked her cant say way hotter than a tired old thing who like barfs all the time
2873237 because i knew i wouldnt have to spend eternity with this major dickwad he cant even spell liaison and god knows its torture to hear a mill workers son try to say anything in french
2873238 although i was honest in every painful detail with my family
2873239 admitting ones mistakes is a hard thing for anyone to do
2873240 all i really wanted to know about was the group sex so like when you have your hand on someone you get my drift
2873241 i did not tell the public when a supermarket tabloid told a version of the story i used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it but being 99 honest is no longer enough
2873242 yeah but how about 25 thats pretty good thats damn good workers unite
2873243 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well

2873254 the biggest threat to the eight is the french in the relay they have posted the best times coming into beijing and it will be a fierce battle
2873255 i have really focused hard on the majors the last two years
2873256 i have turned up to other events and unless i get into contention it feels like a race or a sprint
2873257 where as a major feels like a marathon i feel like i can be patient and take my time i love the feeling of knowing that it is going to come down to the back nine and who can do it under pressure on the last nine holes
2873258 i am a great believer in making it your own responsibility whether you win or dont win i knew i was playing catch up and those are the moments that change tournaments when you take shots on and they come off and you have to do it on the back nine you are not going to win any other way
2873259 i had a discussion with my trainer back home and it was possible i was dehydrated
2873260 so that gave me something to focus on i focused on re hydrating myself whether that was the cause or not i dont know it might have just been tiredness
2873261 but at least i had something tangible that i could pin it on and try to put effort into it and it gave me the belief that if i get my hydration right my co ordination would come back
2873262 i have probably been the leading golfer in europe for close to six years
2873263 it is a big step to move up and start competing on a different level ive got tiger woods and ive got phil mickelson ahead of me
2873264 it is a long way to catch tiger at the top but i know that the only way of focusing on doing that is to focus on controlling what i can do i cant control tiger or phil i am going to continue to strive to improve
2873265 i love the idea of a back nine of a major on sunday so much that i am actually disappointed i am seven months away from the next major

2873269 editors did not want a bunch of farewells running in columns all over the newspaper this weekend
2873270 news is obsolete in seconds thanks to the internets 24 7 news cycle is that tempus does indeed fugit
2873271 the days of overthrowing leaders by military means in europe those days are gone
2873272 we declare those five years four months and 20 days to be gone until the next time we deem it necessary to install democracy anywhere in the world
2873273 he passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital
2873274 no other details are available at this time we ask that his familys privacy continues to be respected
2873275 but because he had it his immune system was compromised he had an infection he was on a new medication that suppresses the immune system and thats where the pneumonia came from
2873276 he passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital
2873277 no other details are available at this time we ask that his familys privacy continues to be respected

2873279 yet despite the traditional prominence of psychotherapy in psychiatric practice and training there are indications of a recent decline in the provision of psychotherapy by u s psychiatrists a trend attributed to reimbursement policies favoring brief medication management visits rather than psychotherapy and the introduction of newer psychotropic medications with fewer adverse effects
2873280 this decline coincided with changes in reimbursement increases in managed care and growth in the prescription of medications
2873281 psychiatrists who provided psychotherapy to all of their patients relied more extensively on self pay patients had fewer managed care visits and prescribed medications in fewer of their visits compared with psychiatrists who provided psychotherapy less often
2873282 these trends highlight a gradual but important change in the content of outpatient psychiatric care in the united states and a continued shift toward medicalization of psychiatric practice
2873283 a key challenge facing the future generation of psychiatrists will likely involve maintaining their professional role as integrators of the biological and psychosocial perspectives while working within the constraints of the strong market forces of third party payers and managed care to implement advances in the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders
2873284 its kind of disappointing when you talk it up and talk it up and then nothing happens
2873285 the houston area got most of the rain today two to four inches

2873288 i want to ask ambassador churkin is your governments objective regime change in georgia the overthrow of the democratically elected government of georgia
2873289 this statement by ambassador khalilzad is absolutely unacceptable particularly from the lips of the permanent representative from a country whose actions we are all aware
2873290 i was just focusing on my own race and that was perfect
2873291 it was a hell of a swim and he is a true champion
2873292 youve got to take your hat off to someone who swims like that in a pressure packed race
2873293 you definitely had to bring your a game here today to win a medal and those three guys who beat me did
2873294 its a testament to just how well beijing has done in preparing the
2873295 the facilities are simply amazing and we are seeing world records being broken like they are the easiest thing in the world to break when they are not
2873296 if you can bounce on his lap i can sit back and relax
2873297 im sure all of our guys are having a rough time with it
2873298 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time
2873299 at present we do not know anything about how the explosions occurred and we are waiting to learn about its cause
2873300 we werent even advised that they were going to be there
2873301 they just moved in and weve been concerned since they were there that something like this would happen
2873302 shopping behavior will noticeably change purchases will go down per capita this will due to belt tightening but also due to the effect of the explosive growth that on line sales will now have on off line sales
2873303 a month ago google accounted for 65 1 of all searches in the u s that compares to 58 3 18 months ago this means that the company has three times the market share of its nearest competitor yahoo and nine times the share of the distant third place finisher microsoft will google continue to be a the central player in the current zeitgeist at least for the next year it will be as it is making all the right moves facing the future
2873304 the transformational changes that digitization and the internet have brought to music video and news reporting will now begin to affect the book publishing industry in a noticeable way the unstoppable process of disintermediation i have often presented in this space will now move to book publishing the two most noticeable areas will be in ebooks and in print on demand amazons launch of the kindle will be the beginning of a rapid upswing in the sale of ebooks albeit from a very small base
2873305 over 70 percent of total global emissions are generated from cities and if you dont measure these emissions you cannot manage them
2873306 this year went about as smoothly as ive seen things go
2873307 the support we get from the community is really incredible not to mention the volunteers and fundraising groups that make the event so special
2873308 emotions are running high when you are out on the water and we all feel pride and accomplishment for being out here supporting the cause
2873309 the milf rebels have defied their own leadership and have refused to leave the area
2873310 when youve lost someone you cant remember i would have been two it leaves a black hole in your heart
2873311 it was hard to imagine who was doing this and when we heard that it was the local people it had a special significance knowing that there were people who cared nearby and even just to bear witness to what had happened that was very important
2873312 theyve tried so hard to organize this and to make you feel wanted and i dont know of anywhere else in the world you would find that except for perhaps this corner of the world
2873313 gordon pointed out to me as closely as possible where the crash had actually taken place so it gave me a very good idea and then the fact that macrae was there him having been a pilot we were trying to understand from the point of view of the pilot and the crew what was going on
2873314 were able to do renovations and have the money in place but i dont see this happening until sometime in the new year
2873315 we need to do renovations there to put a provincial courtroom in there
2873316 ideally we hope to have a new justice centre constructed in pictou county
2873317 weve decided to move mostly because weve outgrown that office
2873318 we now have three lawyers and support staff working there and originally it was designed for just one attorney weve been there 20 years
2873319 its a lot of explosive big weights for short periods of time training and theres an element to track and field to it the crossover of strength and technique really appeals to me
2873320 jamie is an incredible influence and role model as are all of the guys here
2873321 throw a treasured native species on the barbie how can that be environmentally correct
2873322 im having the time of my life which is great because in 04 i hated every minute of it
2873323 ive always told myself that the character of a person or at least an athlete is discovered when they have to deal with failure unfortunately that was my shining moment because it was the biggest failure of my career to date
2873324 i just stood there and looked at hitler and i though youre supposed to be so famous and youre just so ordinary looking of course i didnt have hate in my heart then for him but when i think about him i have a lot of hate
2873325 or as much as i can at least three times a week ive been very fortunate with my swimming it has been one of the most important things in my life
2873326 absolutely ill watch as much as i can im very interested
2873327 but if anyone asks to see it i can get it for them and im happy to show them
2873328 it was always kind of a dream to have a shop for my boys and get them started
2873329 rustic furniture is depression proof in the sense that many of the people get their materials for free because they use supplies other people dont want and people still need a place to sit down
2873330 you have to move around you have to go places
2873331 theres more and more people putting rustic furniture into their primary homes but i would say the bulk goes into cottages and lakefront homes
2873332 when they can get full extension and dovetail drawers on their dressers it amazes them
2873333 ive always liked that kind of furniture and i just couldnt afford it
2873334 sometimes id like to say oh i want that but i know thats not possible
2873335 it is unfortunate that the democrats and republicans are now building a 50 billion fence on the u s mexico border it has divided families and is severely straining our relationship with mexico the goal of socialist party usa and our presidential candidate brian moore is to build a stronger bond with ours neighbors to the south and a basic income guarantee will help to resolve many of the issues involving immigration
2873336 the one constant in republican victories in fall elections has been large margins in springfield and those surrounding counties said longtime republican consultant john hancock
2873337 if you dont campaign hard in a region of the state that is growing that represents a lot of votes
2873338 a good performing republican will get 65 percent of the vote in greene and surrounding counties
2873339 this race will be fought and won in the margins
2873340 if youre a democrat and cant get north of 40 percent in greene county youre in trouble
2873341 a lot of things he said have really turned off and angered a lot of people including greene county democrats
2873342 the threat of obama is enough to get the hard core conservatives out
2873343 its the worst ive ever seen it in my lifetime and im 64 years old
2873344 just ignoring them which is what he seems to be doing could make matters worse
2873345 you can reach a lot of voters with very limited media buys
2873346 its just the opposite you cant get votes from people if you dont demonstrate to them that you care enough to show up

2873350 its always pretty fun when you walk the dodgers off the field
2873351 theyve done it to us a lot in the past they did it to us in 04 to knock us out of the playoffs it was kind of good to give it back to them
2873352 this was a big series for us to keep our confidence going obviously for those guys in contention if theyre going to do it theyre going to have to go through us were going to have to push them
2873353 if he could do that i was pretty confident i could get to second and theres always a good chance hell beat it out

2873397 oh shit the story is loose from its moorings facts have interfered with our convenient fiction one group is off the suspects list the ones we nominated
2873398 it was with great pleasure and a lot of pride that i told the team about our nomination to be recognised for our efforts at crowne plaza queenstown by our peers in the hospitality industry is an honour and an accolade were thrilled to have
2873399 i was horrified to learn that he hadnt been contacted about the change in arrangements
2873400 ive apologised and weve had a good discussion about that
2873401 we have decided we will march to muzaffarabad with fruit trucks tomorrow
2873402 i dont think there is anything wrong in it if they want to take their trucks to muzafarabad we are supporting them
2873403 i hope it will not be done and it should not be allowed they should not take that route its wrong for them and us also
2873404 everything you read about our team is about how terrible our defense was last season
2873405 how terrible our defensive backfield was basically i just want to shut everyone up
2873406 i have to think of it as a good experience
2873407 i had never played safety never played corner i had never really backpedaled or anything like that so i just tried to learn
2873408 ive been up here busting my butt trying to get in the best shape ive ever been in work on my backpedal just make my skills better there is a lot more competition but that makes everyone better you have to be on your game every play
2873409 it is for the congress leadership that is sonia gandhi to decide what kind of an arrangement can be worked out

2873416 we hope that russia will declare a ceasefire as georgia has already done and this can be settled diplomatically
2873417 we need to work together with russia over a host of important issues including iran
2873418 if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2873419 you tell that rafael that if he doesnt stop encroaching our neighborhood this is going to have a significant long term impact on the hoods relations
2873420 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy

2873440 when you think of soul music you think of isaac hayes the expression the sound and the creativity that goes along with it
2873441 even in his later years he never hesitated to appear for a cause or endorse something that he felt was for the good of mankind he will be sorely missed
2873442 they could go to the bathroom they could get a sandwich or whatever
2873443 the rappers have gone in and created a lot of hit music based upon my influence
2873444 a lot of artists owe isaac his career because a lot of music was based on his foundation
2873445 a person that speaks his mind hes sensitive enough to care for children hes wise enough to not be put into the wack category like everybody else in town and he l o o o o ves the ladies
2873446 there is a place in this world for satire but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry toward religious beliefs of others begins
2873447 has no problem and hes cashed plenty of checks with our show making fun of christians
2873448 we were actually getting ready to schedule a trip to memphis to talk to isaac

2873451 i dont support all of his ideas but evo is our first indigenous president and should be given the chance to finish his term
2873452 the last thing we need is more upheaval more chaos
2873453 well bring some ends in and work them out but they are basically street free agents right now
2873454 everybody is looking for those guys those guys dont just grow on trees or they would be on somebody elses roster
2873455 so well still look at the waiver wire and see if we know somebody or have worked them out in the past or liked them but didnt draft them or take them as a free agent there are a lot of different means and some of those meetings are already going on and we already have people in the pipe that were going to try to bring in

2873458 quarterbacks are continually getting hands across their faces and people waving things and bumped and moved
2873459 so its really more of a distraction that you have to focus through the wideouts were using them today i think were some of the first people to have those we have like 10 pairs of them
2873460 cpi inflation is expected to be higher in the short term at around 5 per cent in the december quarter reflecting the effects of higher petrol prices and the recent correction to estimates of financial services inflation before declining thereafter
2873461 a move in november is a likelihood rather than september
2873462 theres still a fair bit of talk of elevated inflation and that suggests theyll wait for the next cpi before they move
2873463 the way this statement reads its just a little bit of hosing down how excited the market was getting for a 50 basis point rate cut
2873464 when they do start to cut its more likely to be a smaller cut rather than big cuts
2873465 the reserve banks been pretty clear and lucid in terms of slowing growth and is signalling rate cuts are not too far off
2873466 we certainly think well get one in the next few months and certainly by early next year
2873467 were actually saying november or just within the next three months and certainly one will be in by february
2873468 its fairly explicit theyre the rba trying to get a significant slowing in demand and now they see that significant moderation in demand occurring
2873469 i was horrified to learn that he hadnt been contacted about the change in arrangements
2873470 ive apologised and weve had a good discussion about that its a very unfortunate set of circumstances
2873471 the evidence to date is that a significant moderation in demand is now occurring and it is looking more likely the demand will remain subdued and economic growth will be fairly slow in the period ahead
2873472 while inflation is likely to remain high in the short term the board judged at its august meeting that demand was slowing to an extent that could be expected to bring about a significant reduction in inflation over time
2873473 on this basis the board decided that the existing monetary policy setting was appropriate for the time being
2873474 on the assumption that the subdued demand conditions are like to continue scope to move to a less restrictive monetary policy stance in the period ahead is increasing
2873475 the combination of falls in housing and equity prices means that household net wealth has declined in the first half of this year

2873478 bryan is starting to think about possibly getting his career started somewhere else
2873479 well leave him alone hes going to get back to us in a couple of weeks theres not going to be any issues im really confident its going to be resolved amicably before training camp
2873480 interislander and the guild are continuing to make efforts to reach agreement in the current negotiations
2873481 they see you catching the bad guys putting them away and they feel more comfortable that the terrorists arent going to come back that youre going to be there to protect them it isolates the terrorists
2873482 we did more to win the counterinsurgency with our cerp dollars than we did with our weapons

2873492 a factual drama based on the 10th cavalry a negro regiment formed in 1866 lawlessness in tucson brings martial law and the 10th into open conflict with the towns white populace and an army of outlaws members of the honorary 10th cavalry formed in los angeles in 1966 are featured in this episode
2873493 this just adds to the drama of world series fever if both chicago teams end up in the world series people are going to start thinking somethings in the water
2873494 that would be mind boggling in this city oh boy
2873495 although it would be a whole lot more fun sitting in the stands having a beer
2873496 when you win games like these you forget about it as soon as you leave its the losses that stay with you you wonder what you could have done differently
2873497 this job is a lot more demanding than i thought it would be
2873498 and since the cubs havent won in a while it adds to the importance of the situation
2873499 everybody wants to come here because its such a fun city and when they do everyone wants to go out
2873500 hey ive still got to go to work in the morning it would be ok if i was 42 or 43 or even 50 but come on
2873501 i didnt change anything from yesterday but they made good pitches and i didnt see the ball too good
2873502 in my last at bat i turned to cardinals catcher
2873503 i told cubs gm jim hendry i still had something left in the tank
2873504 and my agent told him look if you dont like what you see in a couple of weeks release him
2873505 who would have thought wed both end up in chicago
2873506 this has exceeded all of my expectations to play in not only one of the greatest baseball cities st louis in the country but two is a dream come true
2873507 im not 28 years old and benching 340 pounds anymore
2873508 im 38 and ive had four shoulder surgeries i just cant play in big ballparks anymore believe me im glad im here even on days like this
2873509 i told him hey if you want to look ridiculous go ahead
2873510 my mother used to tell me its ok to grow old but not grow up
2873511 heres my test ask anyone what was the first baseball game they attended who they went with and who was playing now ask the same question about their first football or basketball game
2873512 come on do you ever sit around talking football or basketball trivia
2873513 the only bad thing is if we played in the world series and lost to the cubs our fans would be so upset
2873514 if it meant getting to the world series and losing to the cubs and not getting there at all i think theyd prefer for us not go get there
2873515 my greatest regret was firing tony in 1986 the gm just didnt want him looking back i should have fired the gm now hes our broadcaster ken harrelson
2873516 you could have gone to any cemetery in the city
2873517 and you would have seen graves decorated with white sox colors the impact on the city was incredible ill run into people in shopping centers at plays everywhere who are still thanking me
2873518 i know if we dont win another one at least weve won one
2873519 but id sure like to win another it wont be the same as the first one but when you win the first one it makes you hungry for another
2873520 whoever is the best guy will play i expect that to be me
2873521 i was still trying to play but it was like my shoulder didnt work right
2873522 my shoulder always worked great my entire life but after the injury the ball wouldnt go where i wanted it to
2873523 it was miserable coming to work it was a mess but you learn from it
2873524 im not sure anybody can go through all that turnover and not have it affect you
2873525 im sure its affecting him then you add shaun to it the maturation process for alex is over hes ready to go but all of a sudden its a battle
2873526 its good for alex to compete for this position hes never had to now he has a guy whos really pushing him how does he deal with it
2873527 your quarterback has to be your best competitor on the field
2873528 the way i look at it is the way its been presented to me the best quarterback is going to play
2873529 though its assumed matts the starter ive been told there are no other factors than who is the best player
2873530 im skeptical because ive heard that before and it hasnt come true
2873531 but at the same time im excited ill put my skills up against anybodys whoever is the best guy will play i expect that to be me
2873532 to have 64 quarterbacks start games last season is shocking
2873533 with the demise of nfl europa now how do you get guys ready to play with that position you have to play games to get better
2873534 its a preseason dilemma for coaches in terms of the competition part
2873535 i grew up in the school where you didnt have competition you tried to pick your guy and give him every possible snap tom brady dont share snaps in practice so how do you share snaps and find your quarterback ive never been involved with that
2873536 quarterback is the most difficult position to play in sports
2873537 with salary caps young top draft picks are forced to play sooner that can really hurt their confidence and set them back
2873538 with all the hirings and firings of head coaches and coordinators theres a lot of turnover
2873539 with all the blitzes and multiple coverages its all reactionary knowing where to go with the ball
2873540 as a coach for young quarterbacks you have to make it easy for them
2873541 arizona is the most fascinating quarterback situation in the league because i know kurt in his heart wants to be the guy and i know matt wants to win the job
2873542 its going to be interesting to see kurts approach is he going into it as a support system and a fan of matt leinart or is he approaching it that hell do anything to win it
2873543 theres a responsibility on kurt to be the best he can be and at the same time to help mentor matt
2873544 the joe montanas or steve youngs the good quarterbacks come all shapes sizes and arm strengths
2873545 the one thing that is common among the great ones is they find a way to get their team in the end zone
2873546 they think you can just dial 1 800 and get a quarterback
2873547 theres teams that have been trying to dial that number for 10 years
2873548 each year is a different year you go with whats going on at the time the year i stayed with rex he was our best option
2873549 we feel like we have a couple of options now were starting from scratch if rex ends up being our quarterback im going to support him the way i supported him before im supporting the best person for the job
2873550 i signed a contract knowing what the situation was going to be
2873551 it is what it is ill make the best of it theres nothing stopping me from having an unbelievable season i feel like if i go out there and do my job everything should take care of itself
2873552 they never came up with a solution for how to go about it when i signed my contract in march they said they were going to give us even reps whoever starts the first practice it didnt matter so they flipped a coin to show that they werent leaning one way or another
2873553 rex was our guy each year is a different year
2873554 if rex ends up being our quarterback im going to support him the way i supported him before im supporting the best person for the job
2873555 ive had a dramatic career so far whether its injury unbelievable games terrible games
2873556 ive been nfl player of the month ive won a playoff game in overtime at soldier field by completing a third and 10 pass ive been on the big stage the super bowl then three games later being benched
2873557 ive learned a lot to sum it up its more of a mind set
2873558 i just want to show everybody my teammates coaches and the people who picked me that i can play well at this level
2873559 i feel i play my best in an offense where i eliminate the gray being here with coach martz this offseason weve worked to do that
2873560 whether alex wins the job or shaun or even j t osullivan id like to think weve got three guys who can do the job
2873561 only once in 49ers history has this franchise had one quarterback play a whole season and that was alex two years ago thats from john brodie y a tittle joe montana steve young
2873562 it takes a special breed to be an elite quarterback
2873563 theres so much asked of you and the toughest thing to find in a quarterback is consistency and reliability
2873564 you dont find very many guys who can have the field awareness and play at a consistently high level
2873565 he just needs to be more consistent throwing the ball
2873566 from my first minicamp to otas organized team activities and the start of training camp ive seen growth with alex
2873567 mike martz took marc bulger one an undrafted guy and the other a sixth round pick and kurt was a two time mvp and marc a pro bowler and heres alex smith a former no 1 pick who i expect to outdo what both kurt and marc did in this offense
2873568 it has nothing to do with his talent its going to have to do with his maturity from what im hearing its happening
2873569 can that maturity sustain itself theres a huge gap in trust between the quarterbacks and vernon ill say it publicly i did not trust him
2873570 thats on vernon to earn the respect of the quarterbacks there if that happens he can be one of the better tight ends
2873571 vernon needs a coach like mike martz who will demand accountability
2873572 the best friend for a young quarterback is a good defense and a good run game
2873573 a young quarterback should be part of the success not the main ingredient
2873574 as if there arent enough lawyers out there inventing lawsuits now were going to invite the public to do so
2873575 the mere fact that it happens annually is something great
2873576 he took black music to another level made it more classic
2873577 they say this cat shaft is a bad mother shut your mouth

2873584 there was a time not so long ago when i used to enjoy rushing to this blog and reading comments i used to look forward to pitting my wits against people who i didnt necessarily agree with but who could argue a point on its merit sure they didnt like me and would not trust me further than they could throw me but they had the maturity and self confidence to listen
2873585 last night as i finished my last post i realised that i was filled with dread at the heap of personal abuse i was expecting when i logged on this morning and i was not wrong

2873600 may the lord bless all of you abundantly for your kindness and hospitality
2873601 i have really focused hard on the majors the last two years
2873602 i have turned up to other events and unless i get into contention it feels like a race or a sprint
2873603 where as a major feels like a marathon i feel like i can be patient and take my time i love the feeling of knowing that it is going to come down to the back nine and who can do it under pressure on the last nine holes
2873604 i am a great believer in making it your own responsibility whether you win or dont win i knew i was playing catch up and those are the moments that change tournaments when you take shots on and they come off and you have to do it on the back nine you are not going to win any other way
2873605 i had a discussion with my trainer back home and it was possible i was dehydrated
2873606 so that gave me something to focus on i focused on re hydrating myself whether that was the cause or not i dont know it might have just been tiredness
2873607 but at least i had something tangible that i could pin it on and try to put effort into it and it gave me the belief that if i get my hydration right my co ordination would come back
2873608 i have probably been the leading golfer in europe for close to six years
2873609 it is a big step to move up and start competing on a different level ive got tiger woods and ive got phil mickelson ahead of me
2873610 it is a long way to catch tiger at the top but i know that the only way of focusing on doing that is to focus on controlling what i can do i cant control tiger or phil i am going to continue to strive to improve
2873611 i love the idea of a back nine of a major on sunday so much that i am actually disappointed i am seven months away from the next major
2873612 in the case of invisibility cloaks or shields the material would need to curve light waves completely around the object like a river flowing around a rock

2873626 russian officials believe that it was the usa that orchestrated the current conflict the chairman of the state duma committee for security vladimir vasilyev believes that the current conflict is south ossetia is very reminiscent to the wars in iraq and kosovo

2873628 known for its extensive links to albanian and european crime syndicates the kla was supported from the outset in the mid 1990s by the cia and germanys intelligence agency the bundes nachrichten dienst bnd in the course of the 1999 war the kla was supported directly by nato
2873629 the kla had extensive links to al qaeda which was also involved in military training mujahideen mercenaries from a number of countries integrated the ranks of the kla which was involved in terrorist activities as well as political assassinations
2873630 the things that were happening in kosovo the things that were happening in iraq we are now following the same path the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america south ossetian defense officials used to make statements about imminent aggression from georgia but the latter denied everything whereas the us department of state released no comments on the matter in essence they have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals they are responsible for this the world community will learn about it
2873631 the rapid increase in us strategic influence in the caucasus has alarmed russian policy planners moscow is keen to take steps to shore up its eroding position in the region however russian officials have limited options with which to counter us moves while at the same time maintaining cordial relations with washington
2873632 the most prominent us moves in the caucasus are the decision to dispatch military advisers to georgia and a march 29 state department announcement on the lifting of an arms embargo imposed on armenia and azerbaijan both actions have the potential to tilt the military establishments of all three caucasus nations away from russia and towards nato
2873633 the rose revolution was not a simple uprising but was aided by the cia and ambassador richard miles think serbia from early 2002 onwards the cia had been operating in georgia supposedly to combat al qaeda
2873634 spokesmen for the state department and the c i a declined to confirm that mr woodruff was working for the intelligence agency but high ranking administration officials said he was adding that he was not spying on georgian officials but was training mr eduard shevardnadzes security forces
2873635 georgia was rocked by opposition rallies for six days last november as protesters occupied central tbilisi demanding saakashvilis resignation over allegations of corruption and increasing authoritarianism
2873636 the georgian leader responded by sending in riot police to crack down on protesters on november 7 over 500 people were injured according to human rights watch as police used rubber bullets tear gas and water cannons to break up the demonstrations
2873637 a total of around 1 650 soldiers form the us georgia and several other east european countries have begun exercises on the formerly russian controlled vaziani base the georgian defense ministry said
2873638 a deadly firefight between georgian troops and separatists in a russian backed breakaway region ahead of rices arrival a senior state department official who did not want to be identified told reporters that unchecked conflict in the region could lead to catastrophe the official also said moscow should realize its soviet empire is gone
2873639 in addition to the spy drones israel has also been supplying georgia with infantry weapons and electronics for artillery systems and has helped upgrade soviet designed su 25 ground attack jets assembled in georgia according to koba liklikadze an independent military expert based in tbilisi former israeli generals also serve as advisers to the georgian military
2873640 georgian administration has found the use to its arms which they have been purchasing during the recent several years we have repeatedly warned that the international community should not turn a blind eye on massive purchases of offensive arms in which the georgian administration has been involved during the recent two years

2873644 he should be in myrtle beach and you know if hes going to take a vacation at this time
2873645 y oull never find john mccain changing his stripes just because of an election
2873646 youd better have given me all your stuff or ill kill you
2873647 we feel that a customer would want to buy products that cesar recommends since hes a specialist in his field
2873648 terribly rocked i thought we got hit by lightening at first
2873649 i ran out freaking out it was just too intense
2873650 because our windows blew out light fixtures came down and part of our ceiling
2873651 we could see the actual lighting up of the sky from the basement window
2873652 the initial explosion was so intense it was like a war zone it was literally like we were being bombed
2873653 there could have been 20 30 that went off in our area and as it moved down towards wilson tanks were going off one right after the other
2873654 my daughter said it two days ago mom this area is a danger zone
2873655 why did they put all that gas there why why
2873656 everything was dusty and i just grabbed some clothes i didnt know what was going on
2873657 i was just trying to get out of there i felt the heat and started running i could feel the heat it was burning the back of my shirt so i kept running in the opposite direction
2873658 the ceiling was coming down and i crawled out of bed
2873659 it lit up the area like sunshine and heat lots of heat
2873660 i ran into the backyard and jumped over the fence and kept on running
2873661 there was a very large amount of fire when we arrived and the extent of blast heard as far away as it was and hopefully we wont find any people missing or injured
2873662 but so far it looks like we got off very lucky
2873663 it was a very difficult fire to fight because of the heat and the amount of fire spread out over a very large area
2873664 the government prior to the election ruled out a return to compulsory student unionism
2873665 the original vision at the heart of shared worlds has always been the desire to provide a place where oddball kids like me could get together and play with ideas
2873666 im not making any guarantees to anybody about which party i would support i certainly havent been happy about the labor party in various issues that have come before us during this last term of parliament
2873667 but id like to see what the clp would do about those issues obviously also people will have sent a message to the government theyre not happy with them theres a 9 per cent swing so i have to listen to what the people are saying
2873668 there has been a strong swing against the government certainly as the chief minister i have listened to that swing i will listen to what territorians have said
2873669 we will wait and see what the count will unveil in the coming days and there will be plenty of time to sit around and make an assessment about what went right and what went wrong
2873670 i dont deny the two films sound similar although i havent seen 21 my script was written long before 21 was released so theres no question of me being inspired by the film
2873671 but we obviously made many changes for one we couldnt have the game of blackjack no one in india understands blackjack also the motivations had to change but yes like 21 and many other contemporary films teen patti is a study of materialism greed and acquisitiveness in our times
2873672 the delay was unfortunate but my producer ambika hinduja and i were very clear that mr bachchan was the films fulcrum everyones dates had to be adjusted according to his convenience now people will draw comparisons between teen patti and 21 but my film has nothing to do with blackjack
2873673 it do knot disturb is an out and out comedy lets not pretend about that but it is an original idea and script when david and i come together we cant fool around with peoples expectations
2873674 when govinda says he has full faith in me i get frightened will i be able to deliver again this time i cant say our film is spectacularly different from what weve done so far but at the same time i must admit audiences want to see something different
2873675 look at jannat its success is so welcome but i cant do something too different with govinda because i cant play around with audiences expectations
2873676 im simultaneously launching my son jackie in vivek sharmas kal kissne dekha while he will be shooting it in south africa ill be with david and the crew for do knot disturb in delhi
2873677 nos hacen falta rutas de camiones porque pr cticamente tenemos la 45 y la 612 entonces si uno quiere ir a zapopan tiene que tomar cuatro camiones si queremos ir a la cabecera usamos dos camiones por eso necesitamos m s rutas sobre todo ahora que est la prepa de la udeg y hay m s afluencia de estudiantes en ocasiones los midibuses no dan la parada porque vienen llenos

2873680 im very humbled that the people of braitling have put their faith in me to represent them in the northern territory
2873681 what i take out of it is a very resounding defeat by labor i think people have walked away recognising that labor have forgotten about people in the bush
2873682 what the fuck why did i play through this game then
2873683 we also have to do more to support and strengthen lgbt families
2873684 because equality in relationship family and adoption rights is not some abstract principle its about whether millions of lgbt americans can finally live lives marked by dignity and freedom
2873685 thats why we have to repeal laws like the defense of marriage act thats why we have to eliminate discrimination against lgbt families and thats why we have to extend equal treatment in our family and adoption laws
2873686 desire to build a life with a loved one to provide for a family and to have children who will grow and thrive are desires that all people share regardless of race sex religion sexual orientation or gender identity
2873687 that the cost of the american dream must never come at the expense of the american family for decades weve had politicians in washington who talk about family values but we havent had policies that value families instead its harder for working parents to make a living while raising their kids its even harder to get a break
2873688 no fools you dont know what youre doing i can help kill me and all will be los mmmph

2873695 totally out of order for princess haya to intervene at that point
2873696 she was put up to it but it was not for her to make changes at that stage its a point of principle because it undermines the authority of the ground jury and the technical delegate
2873697 im furious and if the fei ask me in future to go on any of their advisory committees i shall refuse
2873698 it seemed at that time that we didnt really have a choice

2873701 as the first olympics in a communist state since moscow in 1980 a battle looms over the message of the 2008 games
2873702 for the ruling party it is the ultimate propaganda opportunity to show the governments success in lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty for tibetan independence activists human rights campaigners persecuted peasants and environmentalists it is a chance to expose the dark side of the planets biggest one party state
2873703 its the day before the olympics and we want to send a message to samsung that its losing the race for tv recycling
2873704 difficult to make a point when youre not the focus of the media attention but youre in the larger panorama
2873705 its an opportunity to introduce a problem to a larger public that has not heard about the issue

2873710 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2873711 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2873712 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2873713 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2873714 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2873715 backing up your whole linux system remotely with rsync has never been easier

2873722 the low yielding currencies from open economies most leveraged to global growth are taking the brunt of the impact while less cyclical fx that also benefit from the oil price decline are being impacted the least

2873729 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2873730 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2873731 i think i was willing them into the hole at that stage
2873732 you have to get focused and give it a go
2873733 but i guess thats the way things go sometimes the only thing i can do is go back home with my head up high and keep working on it
2873734 lets try to keep this as positive as we can please
2873735 i turned to my caddie on 16 and said god this is a lot of fun just to watch
2873736 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

2873740 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2873741 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2873742 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2873743 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2873744 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2873745 i saw it today here at the park about probably twenty feet away from me people were smoking marijuana
2873746 we are in negotiation with lend lease and we expect the deal to be signed before the end of this year
2873747 the contractors have taken precautionary measures pre buying concrete pre buying steel
2873748 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2873749 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2873750 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2873751 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2873752 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2873753 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2873754 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2873755 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2873756 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2873757 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2873758 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2873759 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2873760 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2873761 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2873762 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2873763 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2873764 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2873765 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2873766 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2873767 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2873768 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2873769 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2873770 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2873771 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2873772 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2873773 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

2873816 i think we are getting far beyond my realm to make analogies about the vietnam war but i will tell you that we are very concerned about what were seeing in the city and were taking a lot of time to go back and look at the baghdad security plan we are asking ourselves if the conditions under which it was first devised still exist today or have the conditions changed and therefore modification to that plan need to be made we are never going to everything stays very dynamic in this type of environment and it is clear that the conditions under which we started are not the same as today and so it does require some modification to the plan and there is an intense about of discussion and briefings that are being at both the government of iraq level and our level to specifically address these facets

2873825 nevertheless this malaysian tree shrew is never drunk this suggests a beneficial effect and sheds a whole new light on the evolution of human alcoholism
2873826 the pen tailed tree shrew is considered a living model for extinct mammals representing the stock from which all extinct and living tree shrews and primates radiated
2873827 therefore we hypothesize that moderate to high alcohol intake was present early on in the evolution of these closely related lineages
2873828 alcohol use and abuse can no longer be blamed on the inventors of brewing of about 9 000 years ago
2873829 so far the current theories on alcoholism have stated that mankind and its ancestors were either used to taking no alcohol at all or maybe only low doses via fruits before the onset of beer brewing
2873830 as brewing is such a recent event on the evolutionary time scale we were not able to develop an adequate defence against the adverse effects of alcohol and the partly hereditary addiction mankind is suffering from an evolutionary hangover
2873831 alcohol consuming tree shrews are not real shrews in fact they belong to the primates closest living relatives and are ecologically and behaviourally comparable to their extinct ancestors that lived more than 55 million years ago
2873832 studying these fascinating creatures is an unexpected golden opportunity to learn about the causes and consequences of real life drinking
2873833 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies

2873835 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers

2873838 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2873839 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2873840 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2873841 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2873842 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2873843 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2873844 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2873845 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2873846 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2873847 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2873848 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2873849 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2873850 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2873851 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2873852 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2873853 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2873854 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2873855 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2873856 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2873857 hey mom why dont you take our picture so i snap it and ricky is making some kind of weird hand and face gestures
2873858 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2873859 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2873860 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2873861 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2873862 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2873863 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2873864 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2873865 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2873866 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2873867 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2873868 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2873869 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2873870 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2873871 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2873872 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2873873 who are open to doing something on the production side
2873874 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2873875 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2873876 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2873877 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2873878 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2873879 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2873880 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

2873885 but the yen has gotten a bit stronger in early tokyo time and that may limit further gains
2873886 their recent earnings results have shown net profits at their core businesses declined as the economy is getting worse bad loans from mid to small sized companies are on the rise
2873887 the evidence to date is that a significant moderation in demand is now occurring and it is looking more likely the demand will remain subdued and economic growth will be fairly slow in the period ahead
2873888 while inflation is likely to remain high in the short term the board judged at its august meeting that demand was slowing to an extent that could be expected to bring about a significant reduction in inflation over time
2873889 on this basis the board decided that the existing monetary policy setting was appropriate for the time being
2873890 on the assumption that the subdued demand conditions are like to continue scope to move to a less restrictive monetary policy stance in the period ahead is increasing

2873915 he had this fabulous smile and a great twinkle in his eyes
2873916 the first thought that went through my mind when i met him was uh oh stay away from that one
2873917 he used to be this strapping construction worker who loved to hunt and fish we used to float down the st croix together fishing for smallmouth
2873918 now about all he can do is raise his eyebrows a bit because his body has failed him but hes a great great kid his mind is still as sharp as a tack and what can i tell you he just fell in love
2873919 when you care for someone with anything like this you have to be on such an intimate level that a lot of people cant handle it and walk away with the care that i give him your guard has to be totally down and you have to be totally open all i know is i cant imagine being with anyone else and feeling as strong for them as i do for this man
2873920 there are a lot of disabled people in this boat who love each other and want to be together
2873921 as long as were ok with god we dont care what the government thinks

2873933 we found a chemical reporter that detects a relatively rare event one that is related to the action of the toxin
2873934 our reporter probe shows that the reaction is taking place
2873935 when theres no toxin there will be no light emission
2873936 now that we have an assay that senses the toxins activity we can try to discover inhibitors of the toxin or antidotes
2873937 this study illustrates the impact flossing can have on oral health the twins experimental model is a powerful tool to help sort out genetic and environmental factors that often confound the interpretation of treatment studies this study demonstrates that flossing can have an important and favorable impact on an individual as compared to that of a non flossing individual with similar genetics and possibly similar habits
2873938 twins tend to share the same or similar environmental factors such as dietary habits health and life practices as well as genetics in this case the only difference was flossing and the outcome was significant flossing may significantly reduce the amount of bad bacteria in the mouth
2873939 as a practicing periodontist i am constantly telling my patients to clean between their teeth more using dental floss or interdental cleaners
2873940 patients tend to think that flossing cant possibly make that much of a difference but this study demonstrates that the addition of flossing to your dental hygiene routine can significantly reduce the amount of periodontal disease causing bacteria even after just two weeks
2873941 these snails have an operculum a door that closes the shell
2873942 they can be out of the water for longer than other snails and when fed to fish they are not digested and sometimes come out alive this has a potential to alter the salmon and trout fisheries because they alter the food chain
2873943 in the western u s this species is of special concern largely because of their ability to modify ecosystems
2873944 in our most recent survey we were lucky if we found a few hundred per square meter
2873945 in lake erie they are not very abundant but it is unclear what they are doing 100 feet below the surface
2873946 the first is that any introduction of a nonnative species can cause worse problems than they were expected to cure the second is that these flukes have a multiple host life cycle infecting ducks that are apparently not affected before infecting the snails this might work in the west where the snails are in shallow water but no duck is going to dive 100 feet to get snails
2873947 that means that recreational water users must be very careful moving from one place to another we advise anglers to freeze waders and fishing gear or use formula 409 or something like that to kill the snails
2873948 i have frozen them for 12 hours at a time and about 50 percent of them survive
2873949 much like humans female guppies produce relatively few eggs and give birth to live offspring they dont lay their eggs for a seasonal spawning but keep them inside their bodies where they are fertilised by the males because they are not reliant on seasons the females have a continuous battle to keep the males at bay so they are resorting to extreme measures to avoid unwelcome attention
2873950 this may be the first time a physical signature for a personality disorder has been identified
2873951 for the first time to my knowledge we have a specific brain association for people with a personality disorder
2873952 its new and different because its not a lesion or injury to the brain but it is a difference in perceiving information that comes from an interaction
2873953 its not just a matter of bad attitudes or a lack of will
2873954 we have great strength in the area of personality disorders through our relationship with the menninger clinic
2873955 gab2 is a signalling protein which means that its involved in transmitting signals from the cell surface to the interior of the cell instructing it to do specific things such as divide or migrate
2873956 gab2 performs a number of signalling roles in normal cells throughout the body and is usually switched off when its not needed our task has been to work out how the body switches off gab2 so that we can mimic that process in abnormal cells
2873957 weve identified a completely novel mechanism for switching off gab2 this uses another molecule that attaches to gab2 and acts as a kind of shield preventing it from transmitting further proliferative signals
2873958 this binding partner or off switch is called 14 3 3 and is used to disable gab2 in a number of cellular settings when it is no longer needed
2873959 as gab2 plays key roles in signalling systems that underpin both normal physiological responses and oncogenesis its very important to understand its control mechanisms
2873960 our next step will be to obtain more structural information about how 14 3 3 shields gab2 once we know that it should be possible to design drugs to combat gab2 activated diseases in novel ways
2873961 this is the first study in europeans to show a beneficial association on wet amd from the consumption of oily fish and is consistent with results from studies in the usa and australia two 3oz servings a week of oily fish such as salmon tuna or mackerel provides about 500 mg of dha and epa per day
2873962 to know how this happens at the molecular level how things bounce skip spin tumble push and pull represents a big leap in our understanding
2873963 these initial observations from ostm jason 2 compare very closely to those of jason 1
2873964 to be able to collect such high quality science data within a month of launch breaks previous records it is also a direct reflection of how mature the field of satellite altimetry has become and of the seamless cooperation of our international team
2873965 tpa has been demonstrated to reduce disability from ischemic clot caused stroke however the drug is only currently approved for use within three hours of symptom onset
2873966 it is important for people to recognize the symptoms of stroke and promptly call 9 1 1 emergency medical services when they occur
2873967 although patients arriving at the hospital within two hours of symptom onset were significantly more likely to receive a timely ct scan than those who did not 24 percent vs 9 percent most 76 percent did not
2873968 this points to areas where stroke systems of care can be improved in hospitals improvements could increase patients access to time dependent therapies and potentially reduce disability from stroke
2873969 although the number of hiv diagnoses among men in this group decreased the last two decades recent data shows these rates are on the rise again making it critical that we continue to understand this group in order to guide prevention and education efforts
2873970 when one drinks or uses other substances inhibitions are lowered making people more likely to engage in risky behavior like unprotected sex this is particularly true for young people who often take risks without thinking about the consequences some patients who are newly diagnosed might be in denial which could lead to poor decisions when it comes to sex
2873971 unfortunately such behaviors put the partners of these men at great risk for contracting hiv and unknowingly transmitting it to others
2873972 which hiv infected men who have sex with men msm in care are most likely to transmit hiv to others
2873973 i have really focused hard on the majors the last two years
2873974 i have turned up to other events and unless i get into contention it feels like a race or a sprint
2873975 where as a major feels like a marathon i feel like i can be patient and take my time i love the feeling of knowing that it is going to come down to the back nine and who can do it under pressure on the last nine holes
2873976 i am a great believer in making it your own responsibility whether you win or dont win i knew i was playing catch up and those are the moments that change tournaments when you take shots on and they come off and you have to do it on the back nine you are not going to win any other way
2873977 i had a discussion with my trainer back home and it was possible i was dehydrated
2873978 so that gave me something to focus on i focused on re hydrating myself whether that was the cause or not i dont know it might have just been tiredness
2873979 but at least i had something tangible that i could pin it on and try to put effort into it and it gave me the belief that if i get my hydration right my co ordination would come back
2873980 i have probably been the leading golfer in europe for close to six years
2873981 it is a big step to move up and start competing on a different level ive got tiger woods and ive got phil mickelson ahead of me
2873982 it is a long way to catch tiger at the top but i know that the only way of focusing on doing that is to focus on controlling what i can do i cant control tiger or phil i am going to continue to strive to improve
2873983 isnt this usually a reference to judgment day following the 2
2873984 how so havent christians been warning of this for generations
2873985 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2873986 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2873987 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2873988 were alarmed by this entire situation and every escalatory step is a further problem
2873989 yet despite the traditional prominence of psychotherapy in psychiatric practice and training there are indications of a recent decline in the provision of psychotherapy by u s psychiatrists a trend attributed to reimbursement policies favoring brief medication management visits rather than psychotherapy and the introduction of newer psychotropic medications with fewer adverse effects
2873990 this decline coincided with changes in reimbursement increases in managed care and growth in the prescription of medications
2873991 psychiatrists who provided psychotherapy to all of their patients relied more extensively on self pay patients had fewer managed care visits and prescribed medications in fewer of their visits compared with psychiatrists who provided psychotherapy less often
2873992 these trends highlight a gradual but important change in the content of outpatient psychiatric care in the united states and a continued shift toward medicalization of psychiatric practice
2873993 a key challenge facing the future generation of psychiatrists will likely involve maintaining their professional role as integrators of the biological and psychosocial perspectives while working within the constraints of the strong market forces of third party payers and managed care to implement advances in the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders

2874004 hes such a great friend and such a great teammate and im really going to hate to see him leave at the end of the year
2874005 he has been so much fun to work with this year
2874006 it sure looked like a major drama when we came through there
2874007 i was expecting yellow tape to be strung around it as a crime scene
2874008 hes out this year hes got a torn ligament in his big toe
2874009 he was playing good he was playing good in the game
2874010 hes made progress until he had the injury and now its a weird deal but i feel bad for him because he came in and worked really hard he was really going to push for a lot of playing time throughout this year so were obviously light at corner
2874011 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection

2874017 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2874018 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2874019 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2874020 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2874021 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2874022 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2874023 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2874024 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2874025 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2874026 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2874027 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2874028 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2874029 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2874030 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2874031 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2874032 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2874033 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2874034 two cups of milk a day can enhance weight loss which is directly linked to reducing metabolic syndrome risk
2874035 thats so beautiful can i put it on my weblog

2874038 should only rabbis and church leaders have been allowed to choose the canon or should common people have been given the right to vote on it as well
2874039 if you give people freedom of information what do you do about responsibility
2874040 if you try to protect information isnt that censorship and how are people likely to respond
2874041 how do you find a balance between human freedoms and protecting important information
2874042 is it always a good thing to let people think or believe whatever they want
2874043 what would you do for the sake of your deepest beliefs
2874044 what would you do if faced with someone who disagreed with your more sacred beliefs
2874045 you arent scared of your mother but some teachers are scary
2874046 you dont have to be worn out all the time
2874047 i do think homeschooling is an odd choice when i look at the bounty offered in the public school system
2874048 a child who reaches age 21 without smoking abusing alcohol or using drugs is virtually certain never to do so

2874050 im better off when i want to be fighting it and thats why i have done well when things like this week when im not quite on my game
2874051 i could tell that i lost people for awhile there
2874052 but i could understand because they probably knew sergio and padraig a little better but i had great support out there and i know that its because im wearing detroit lions gear im sure they wanted to see someone representing their detroit lions win
2874053 my thing is im going to do what ive done in the past whatever opportunity presents itself im going to look at it
2874054 i dont prefer platooning here but i understand because i got off to a slow start thats part of it but i feel im playing better now im back to being a threat i need to be

2874058 they bit the complainant a couple of times in the leg area he refused any type of medical attention so didnt require any time of hospitalization
2874059 i think i was willing them into the hole at that stage
2874060 you have to get focussed and let the adrenaline help with that
2874061 the only thing i can do is go back home with my head up high and keep working on it
2874062 yeah just look around you 99 percent of the people here are total hipsters
2874063 these hipster zombies are the idols of the style pages the darlings of viral marketers and the marks of predatory real estate agents
2874064 and they must be buried for cool to be reborn
2874065 yeah i dont know you shouldnt use that word its just
2874066 no its just well if you dont know why then you just shouldnt even use it
2874067 ok so what are you girls doing tonight after this party
2874068 im dubious of these hypotheses because they always smell of an agenda
2874069 youre not some club kid in new york in the nineties this shit is so hipster
2874070 if you dont give a damn we dont give a fuck

2874082 as a gesture of our apology and deep respect for the folks at mad magazine we are creating a cross departmental task force to study the importance of humor in the corporate workplace and expect the resulting powerpoint presentation to top out at least 300 pages chock full of charts graphs and company action plans
2874083 we at mad were shocked and confused by this entire incident mainly because we had no idea that circuit city even sells magazines
2874084 over 70 percent of total global emissions are generated from cities and if you dont measure these emissions you cannot manage them
2874085 i am a woman who is deeply troubled i was pouring out my soul to the lord
2874086 in bitterness of soul hannah wept much and prayed to the lord
2874087 the associative link between the disenchanting of sex and increased sexial brutality among children works like this if our children are raised to believe in the words of that new jersey kindergarten teacher that talking about the most private things is no different from talking about an elbow then they are that much more likely to see nothing wrong in certain kinds of sexual violence whats really so terrible after all in making someone touch or kiss your elbow
2874088 were not flocking to jane austen movies because we want the facts but because were sick of having the facts shoved in our faces all the time one is entitled to imagine that there might be something more to hope for than all this dreary crudeness this view of sex as something autonomous and cut off from obligation
2874089 tomorrow morning in front of western royal form up at 9 45 for procession
2874090 today news reports indicate that russian military forces crossed an internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of georgia russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory what is most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
2874091 the government of georgia has called for a cease fire and for a resumption of direct talks on south ossetia with international mediators the u s should immediately convene an emergency session of the united nations security council to call on russia to reverse course the u s should immediately work with the eu and the osce to put diplomatic pressure on russia to reverse this perilous course it has chosen we should immediately call a meeting of the north atlantic council to assess georgias security and review measures nato can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation finally the international community needs to establish a truly independent and neutral peacekeeping force in south ossetia
2874092 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia and the united states the united nations security council and the international community should fully support a peaceful resolution to this crisis

2874095 the rock afire explosion videos went viral as they say and all hell broke loose
2874096 i decided to make an investment in the whole youtube phenomenon
2874097 developed by fechter puts internet users in the producers chair as they pay to get new songs produced
2874098 the company didnt want to license characters from me anymore they wanted to own my characters
2874099 but i believed i had a future with the rock afire explosion beyond what they wanted to do with it
2874100 nowadays it would cost several hundred thousand dollars to build a set
2874101 i sold them to fans for next to nothing to put them into the hands of people who loved them
2874102 my dream as far back as i can remember was to own a rock afire explosion stage show
2874103 our label sent me an e mail and said have you guys seen that rock afire website
2874104 its a story of two things the story of how rock afire came to be and how it came to disappear its sort of a tragic story there
2874105 but its also the story of chris thrash who single handedly brought it back into the public arena by putting shows on youtube
2874106 the question now is whether its a nostalgic flash in the pan or is there something there i say lets see if we can create quality content that will give us a new life
2874107 i knew from the very beginning if we could hang on long enough some day the rock afire explosion would live on again
2874108 how the hell am i going to do this without starving
2874109 games are an incredible language and system they should be everywhere
2874110 why are we making games only for the bound pages for a computer screen or console why arent we doing that to help people navigate and understand the world around us
2874111 who is this uncircumcised philistine that he should defy the armies of the living god
2874112 theyre probably right but i will not abandon my conscience voting for either one of those phonies gives me the heebie geebies he said something to me that i couldnt shake
2874113 it is like lying under a huge bug down on the ground where the bugs feet are it looks like mccain and obama are two different feet but the farther up the legs you allow yourself to look you begin to realize that they really are nothing more than two legs connected to the same body
2874114 expect intel to focus even more marketing resources around that name and the core i7 products starting now
2874115 the sex peptide that was responsible for this effect was identified in 1988
2874116 there then followed first a trickle and then an ever increasing stream of identifications of the non sperm seminal fluid proteins
2874117 our results demonstrate an experimental method to identify transferred proteins in any system that is amenable to isotopic labeling and they underscore the power of combining proteomic and evolutionary analyses to shed light on the complex process of drosophila reproduction

2874126 i like him as a captain as a player and as a leader
2874127 on my first day in the job he came to my office and said gaffer i am john terry i replied dont worry i know all about you he is the captain of the team and very important for us
2874128 pre season has been good actually it has been very different
2874129 under jose we never did any running but with scolari we have had our trainers on and done 1 000 metres which is similar to the former managers gianluca vialli and claudio ranieri style of thinking
2874130 and i feel great we are feeling good we are looking good and we are preparing well
2874131 i try to serve the forwards in which ever way they want whether its at ground level or from a deep position my primary aim is to create space and movement and to take the initiative with the other midfielders
2874132 we could do better if we could score early on the games would become a lot easier
2874133 in any team it is important to have a technical leader we had one last year johan micoud and when he left we replaced him with gourcuff who is an excellent technical player who can inspire the others to play well
2874134 you could also consider fernando cavenaghi in that category so having two on the pitch is a considerable advantage
2874135 we need to find a balance so our strike force doesnt paradoxically put us in danger
2874136 i heard the crowd obviously we had offers but they were not enough so we decided he needed to stay with us
2874137 it is not positive that we may not have the players we want here before the champions league game
2874138 the situation has been very difficult for us we have had a lot of players returning to training late after international games in the summer and now we have players at the olympics
2874139 i believe we are ready for the champions league tie the experienced players are ready but we know that we have quality from the young players
2874140 i think fate deals you certain cards and it has dealt us this draw
2874141 from a personal point of view it is disappointing but we have to concentrate on kaunas and not rangers

2874166 when you are disconnected from your biological or spiritual family you become weak and easily lost your resolve of right action taking action to end suffering can evaporate like a drop of water we must practice to overcome our difficulties with our children and with our brothers and sisters by protecting ourselves we protect ourselves we protect our parents and our family and each of us can then help our loved ones transform negative seeds into positive ones the support of family and community helps us be strong and handle our difficulties mindfully
2874167 if negative seeds such as jealousy or discrimination come to the foreground then as brothers and sisters we should help each other to recognize them to smile at them and with loving kindness invite the positive seeds to replace them we must do this without blame or condemnation we should remember that we are all only humans trying our best to practice from time to time violence and anger may manifest in our fellow practitioners but our practice is to smile and embrace them
2874168 we have to learn to open ourselves to each other and to share our experiences insights time and love
2874169 the jobs market has been one of the few bright spots in the uk economy but cracks are appearing in the face of an increasingly uncertain economic outlook
2874170 even if we avoid the scale of jobs fallout suffered in previous downturns the era of the candidates recruitment market is already over with people in work becoming increasingly anxious that their p45 might soon be on its way
2874171 with sales slowing and input costs rising but scope to raise prices limited by weakening demand finances are under pressure
2874172 the epidemic of children working has been present throughout time but certain economic and social factors have made this problem more prevalent in since the negative fallout from global economics slammed the country hard in the 1980s

2874178 we have had about 120 calls regarding flooding in fife people have called from all over the county its not been confined to one part of the county
2874179 there have been no major evacuations or anything like that but a lot of peoples homes have been flooded its just been excessive rain across the county local burns bursting their banks and things like that
2874180 the amount of rain we have had has been unbelievable and thats been the main focus
2874181 fortunately no one has been injured in any of the incidents
2874182 the destruction flooding can cause is traumatic in terms of loss of property and devastating for the people and businesses directly affected
2874183 as we have seen in fife it can also cause travel problems and disrupt peoples lives
2874184 it was just in the course of him performing some operations that he went down
2874185 its hard all of our guys are having a rough time of it
2874186 we have to get in there and we wont do that until its entirely stabilized
2874187 our windows blew everything blew out doors were blown open our door handles actually came off light fixtures had fallen we had glass all over our staircase
2874188 i thought it was an earthquake with the noise and the way my building shook
2874189 windows were flopping in and out like they were rubber stuff was falling from the ceiling like snow things were falling from the shelves a couple of us fell it was the most intense thing ive ever experienced
2874190 i saw homes with very heavy damage but i would not classify it as completely destroyed ive seen homes from explosions before where its nothing but a pile of rubble i didnt see any of that here
2874191 theres five homes that i saw that have damage but theres more than that i saw five but it was dark when i was down there and i didnt see the entire area
2874192 it was a very difficult fire to fight because of the heat and the amount of fire was spread over a very large area
2874193 when the initial explosion went off or one of the explosions went off it obviously spread fire all over the general area
2874194 we had an unknown number of tanks i had various reports of two or four tanks that had flames impinging on them that were venting and burning
2874195 we have that down to one large tanker of liquified petroleum gas and one of them that was burning and venting is no longer venting or venting only sporadically now
2874196 he was filling up his truck and he saw some either smoke or some type of gas and went to report that and left the area as he was leaving the area there was an explosion
2874197 they can stay with us until we can determine whether they can return home or if they need to find other places of accommodation
2874198 its probably propane because its a propane facility but who knows it could be methane it could be anything
2874199 other than this one individual we have not transported anyone else its people we have treated for minor cuts and bruises

2874201 when i saw the ball pass the pitcher the game was over
2874202 i knew once i hit that ball i wouldnt be hustling if i didnt beat that ball out
2874203 to come back these last two games and get great wins like this it does so much for the spirit and mood of a ballclub the sense of confidence that goes throughout that clubhouse we got a couple of breaks there in the ninth but part of it is hustle the way they got down the line and beat out some balls
2874204 its always pretty fun to walk the dodgers off the field
2874205 they have done it to us in the past its good to finally give it back to them

2874213 what states have accomplished for people with mental retardation developmental disabilities is remarkable
2874214 it proves that balancing long term care is achievable and should be used as a model to help states provide home and community based services for older adults
2874215 this is backwards people are entitled to costly nursing home care but not to often more cost effective services in their homes clearly home and community based services are preferred by older residents
2874216 our research shows that older people want to remain in their homes as they age they want independence choice and control over every day decisions however public funds continue to steer older people into institutions
2874217 this underscores the need for better government and private sector
2874218 aarp recognizes the important role that states play they are where the rubber meets the road in terms of health care delivery
2874219 nurses play a significant role in reducing medical errors and improving health care quality which is why we urgently need to find solutions to address both the shortage of nurses and the shortage of faculty to educate them
2874220 the time to simply talk about the problem is over
2874221 whats essential now is to fundamentally rethink how nurses are and should be educated and how they should be deployed in the workforce the experiences of these states offer the best hope for achieving these goals

2874253 i have really focused hard on the majors the last two years
2874254 i have turned up to other events and unless i get into contention it feels like a race or a sprint
2874255 where as a major feels like a marathon i feel like i can be patient and take my time i love the feeling of knowing that it is going to come down to the back nine and who can do it under pressure on the last nine holes
2874256 i am a great believer in making it your own responsibility whether you win or dont win i knew i was playing catch up and those are the moments that change tournaments when you take shots on and they come off and you have to do it on the back nine you are not going to win any other way
2874257 i had a discussion with my trainer back home and it was possible i was dehydrated
2874258 so that gave me something to focus on i focused on re hydrating myself whether that was the cause or not i dont know it might have just been tiredness
2874259 but at least i had something tangible that i could pin it on and try to put effort into it and it gave me the belief that if i get my hydration right my co ordination would come back
2874260 i have probably been the leading golfer in europe for close to six years
2874261 it is a big step to move up and start competing on a different level ive got tiger woods and ive got phil mickelson ahead of me
2874262 it is a long way to catch tiger at the top but i know that the only way of focusing on doing that is to focus on controlling what i can do i cant control tiger or phil i am going to continue to strive to improve
2874263 next question please lets try to keep this as positive as we can please
2874264 i obviously played nicely i shot 69 68 on a tough sunday at a major so im pretty happy about that
2874265 unfortunately i obviously came up a little bit short but i guess thats the way things go sometimes so the only thing i can do is go back home with my head up high and keep working on it
2874266 i hit it left edge and it just didnt break and it lipped out on the left
2874267 i said it before theres guys that get a little bit fortunate they get in contention in a major and manage to get things going their way either because they play well or because somebody else comes back

2874278 jer lu pernah gak merasa sangat sedih di saat yang paling bahagia
2874279 hmmm gw abis nonton dorama serial dram jepang judulnya itu zettai kareshi cerita tentang robot cinta yang dibuat untuk menemani cewek cewek yang kesepian
2874280 konyol ya awalnya gw juga merasa begitu awalnya juga gw kira itu cuma film komedi cinta biasa doang akhirnya beginilah nasib gw
2874281 coba deh cerita sama gw kisah cinta yang bisa membuat lu berkelakuan seperti ini
2874282 awal ceritanya ada cewek yang memang agak sulit kehidupan percintaannya
2874283 tapi tau gak jer ternyata manusia itu makhluk yang lemah apalagi terhadap perasaan kita selalu butuh perhatian kasih sayang dan dorongan dari tempat yang lain apalagi ketika hal itu di saat terburuk kita lu tau kan istilah tetes demi tetes air dapat melubangi sebuah batu karang dan memang itu yang terjadi di film ini sampai akhirnya riiko menganggap robot tersebut adalah bagian dari kehidupannya yang paling penting
2874284 coba deh inget inget gimana perasaan kita saat nonton film drama percintaan kita pasti akan makin seneng kalau dua tokoh utamanya makin dekat dan semakin bahagia tapi ini malah sebaliknya gw malah makin sedih ketika mereka makin dekat makin romantis dan ceweknya makin menggantungkan hidupnya sama si robot itu makin lama makin sedih karena gw tau akhirnya itu akan seperti apa ini dongeng tentang percintaan yang paling menyedihkan yang pernah gw tonton

2874310 he went off and voted with minority leader harry reid on the democratic substitute and i wrote him the now famous letter
2874311 i would like to apologize to you for assuming that your private assurances to me regarding your desire to cooperate in our efforts to negotiate bipartisan lobbying reform legislation were sincere
2874312 im embarrassed to admit that after all these years in politics i failed to interpret your previous assurances as typical rhetorical gloss routinely used in politics to make self interested partisan posturing appear more noble
2874313 that was one incident where he thought i had undercut him i had a completely different view of it
2874314 we had to take tough votes sometimes against the majority of our own party in order to preserve the coalition
2874315 when colleagues disagree on an issue the notion that its cause for attack is mistaken i felt very strongly that the guest worker program was not in the best interests of the country i voted against it he voted for it i respect senator mccains right to take positions different than mine what i dont do is abuse his integrity for doing so
2874316 we can disagree on issues without trying to tear down the other persons reputation or attack his character

2874336 the thirty years that followed wwi brought a series of disasters to the developed world almost without exception the leadership of the mainstream parties in the developed countries concluded that these disasters resulted from instabilities inherit in market economies
2874337 fascism far from being an independent arbiter in the oligopolistic struggle has been largely brought into power by the attempt of the most powerful oligopolists to strengthen through political action their position in the labor market
2874338 cold and lonely holdout against the zeitgeist since with the triumph of the new deal and liberal internationalism conservatism had become a fringe calling
2874339 in most developed countries there is little sign that the basic commitments to a mixed economy of welfare face a fundamental political challenge nor is there much evidence of convergence towards some neo liberal orthodoxy
2874340 would provide all the goods and services for which individuals are prepared to pay a price that covers their production cost
2874341 pure public goods exhibit three technical characteristics non rivalness in consumption non excludability and non rejectablity which together imply that the market is likely to produce inefficiently
2874342 we are of course not wrong in perceiving that the effects of the processes of a free laissez faire capitalist society on the fates of the different individuals are not distributed according to some recognizable principle of justice
2874343 a quasi religious superstition the pursuit of which will lead to the destruction of personal freedom
2874344 the role of state includes erecting and maintaining those publick institutions and those publick works which though they may be in the highest degree advantageous to a great society are of such a nature that the profit could never repay the expanse to any individual or small number of individuals
2874345 the coefficients for each of the three alternative social welfare policy extensiveness measures are negative and statistically significant suggesting that social welfare policies do help to reduce poverty
2874346 the more generous the welfare state the greater is the extent of poverty reduction in addition long term incumbency of left parties affects poverty reduction positively by giving the tax and transfer system a particularly redistributive profile

2874350 pada mulanya adalah firman firman itu bersama sama dengan allah dan firman itu adalah allah yaitu yesus yang mulanya ada bersama sama dengan allah adalah allah itu sendiri yang telah menjadi manusia

2874352 eighty two percent of the words ascribed to jesus in the gospels were not actually spoken by him according to the jesus seminar
2874353 delapan puluh dua persen kata kata yang dianggap berasal dari yesus di dalam injil tidaklah benar benar diucapkan olehnya menurut seminar yesus
2874354 jawab malaikat itu kepadanya roh kudus akan turun atasmu dan kuasa allah yanq maha tinqqi akan menaunqi engkau sebab itu anak yang akan kau lahirkan akan disebut kudus anak allah
2874355 ketika itu juga ia memberitakan yesus di rumah rumah ibadat dan mengatakan bahwa yesus adalah anak allah
2874356 dan mereka berkata tuhan yang maha pemurah mengambil mempunyai anak sesungguhnya kamu telah mendatangkan sesuatu perkara yang sangat munqkar hampir hampir lagit pecah karena ucapan itu dan bumi belah dan gunung gunung runtuh karena mereka mendakwa allah yanq pemurah mempunyai anak
2874357 jawab malaikat itu kepadanya roh kudus akan turun atasmu dan kuasa allah yang maha tinggi akan menaungi engkau sebab itu anak yang akan kau lahirkan akan disebut kudus anak allah
2874358 tidak ada yang terdahulu atau terkemudian diantara satu dengan yang lainya
2874359 jangan insya allah insya allah dong yang pasti aja dong
2874360 jika tuhan menghendakinya kami akan hidup dan beruat ini dan itu
2874361 tetapi aku akan segera datang kepada mu kalau tuhan menghendakinya maka aku akan tahu bukan tentang perkataan orang orang yang sombong itu tetapi tentang kekuatan mereka 1 kor 4 19
2874362 tetapi insya allah aku akan datang kepadamu dengan segeranja dan aku akan mengetahui bukan perkataan mereka itu jang dst 1 kor4 19
2874363 maka tatkala mereka masuk menemui yusuf yusuf membawa ibu bapaknya ke tempatnya dan berkata
2874364 maka tatkala anak mencapai umur dapat bekerja bersamanya ibrahim berkata
2874365 wahai bapakku kerjakanlah apa yang diperintahkan kepada engkau insya allah engkau akan mendapati aku termasuk orang orang yang sabar
2874366 demikian juga babi hutan karena memang berkuku beiah yaitu kukunya bersela panjang tetapi tidak memamah biak haram itu bagimu daging binaiang binatang itu janganlah kamu makan dan bangkainya jartganlah kamu sentuh haram semuanya itu bagimu imamat 11 7
2874367 dan ketika genap delapan hari dan ia harus disunatkan la diberi nama yesus yaitu nama yang disebut oleh malaikat sebelum ia dikandung ibu nya
2874368 yusufpun membeli kain lenan kemudian ia menurunkan mayat yesus dari salib dan mengapaninya dengan kain lenan itu lalu ia membaringkan dia di dalam kubur yang digali di dalam buki t batu kemudian digulingkannya sebuah batu ke pintu kubur itu
2874369 dan barang siapa taat kepada allah dan rasul nya niscaya allah akan memasukkan mereka ke dalam surga yang mengalir sungai sungai di bawahnya mereka kekal di dalamnya dan itulah kejayaan yang besar
2874370 dan barang siapa durhaka kepada allah dan rasul nya dan melanggar batas batasnya hukum allah niscaya allah akan memasukkannya ke dalam neraka kekal di dalamnya dan baginya azab yang menghinakan
2874371 i think i was willing them into the hole at that stage

2874384 above all the prophets remind us of the moral state of a people few are guilty but all are responsible if we admit that the individual is in some measure conditioned or affected by the spirit of society an individuals crime discloses societys corruption in a community not indifferent to suffering uncompromisingly impatient with cruelty and falsehood continually concerned for god and every man crime would be infrequent rather than common
2874385 but this world is not our lasting home we are citizens of heaven
2874386 we must hold ourselves and each other accountable while knowing that the powerful systems in place are not going to change overnight simply because we have good arguments and are well intentioned

2874410 they get in contention in a major and manage to get things going their way and unfortunately it hasnt happened to me i feel like i played well enough to win probably more than two majors throughout my career
2874411 i obviously hold a lot of european players who i grew up watching in high esteem
2874412 to believe that i achieved something they hadnt is very special
2874413 i had to convince myself that no its going to be my day and i deserved to win three majors youve got to be very selfish in this situation when youre on the golf course off the golf course you can look at it in a different light but on the golf course youve got to be hard you cant be soft

2874425 the marketing alliance with chs inc is an important one for graincorp and the australian durum industry
2874426 graincorp brings the strength of our wheat desk our up country grain accumulation and storage expertise our road and rail logistics and port infrastructure to this alliance
2874427 chs inc bring their expertise as a leading durum marketer and processor and the strong relationships they have with the worlds leading durum processors
2874428 for the first time in the history of the durum industry in australia we will be able to leverage a strategic relationship with a truly global marketer not just sell into a limited number of markets
2874429 it could be you press guys wanting an interview something involving tickets or the logistics of practice at the olympics it could be for just about anything
2874430 it was horrific someone that we love and care about whose family was attacked
2874431 it was pretty silent for a while as a male sport we tend to hide our feelings a lot but it definitely became a moment where guys let out how they felt about the situation
2874432 we were trying to make decisions people were supposed to fly here should we tell them to come we didnt know if it was something related to u s athletes usa volleyball or a random act of violence which we now know it was
2874433 our knee jerk reactions were like probably any other human being youre angry upset and we wanted to talk to our friends and family that are here or back home and figure out how we felt about everything
2874434 i talked with my wife an hour about whether or not they should come here and shes a lot stronger than i am she puts things in perspective
2874435 she said unfortunately bad things happen back in fort wayne ind where were from but every day we still go to coney island downtown still go get gas still go to wal mart and thats kind of how you got to go about it
2874436 while your thoughts and prayers always are with the families they would want us to continue on this journey we started four years ago in the end youve got to keep living life
2874437 to me that was a strong indication of her love
2874438 its hard to put it in words thats not something thats supposed to happen
2874439 for all intents it appears to be a random attack by a deranged man
2874440 the only thing weve heard is they were not identifiable except for a small volleyball pin which would probably be invisible to a guy
2874441 we dont believe this was targeted at american citizens and we dont believe it has anything to do with the olympics
2874442 we wanted to do something with our jerseys but we didnt have time
2874443 so we put wizs moms initials and dads initials on the back of our shoes
2874444 obviously you look over to the bench for guidance in difficult situations and we had a couple today

2874446 as i was unlocking my door there was an air condition or heating unit at the end of the hall it started sparking and smoking up and stuff and i walked out of there it and then it caught fire
2874447 ive just been trying to work on everything every single day to get better to be a well rounded heavyweight fighter and a contender in the ufc
2874448 fadel shana appears to have been killed deliberately although he was a civilian taking no part in attacks on israels forces
2874449 contend with perennial abuses at the hands of israeli forces
2874450 they contacted defense industry officials and arms dealers and told them that georgia had relatively large budgets and could be interested in purchasing israeli weapons
2874451 first of all we need to remove 1 000 guys from here within 96 hours after that the rest of the guys
2874452 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document from habbash as outlined in mr suskinds book
2874453 look bailey its my friend from school im going to go say hi
2874454 i refuse to have the same hollister and abercrombie jeans as everyone else at my school
2874455 well if you want another pair of true religions you need to save up your own money for them
2874456 the 2008 convention will highlight americans coming together to change the course of this nation we are at a critical moment in our nations history the politics and policies that have divided us will not allow us to achieve the change we need barack obama is a leader to move america in a new direction and bring us together to turn moments of great challenge into moments of great opportunity this years democratic convention is the story of people from across the country who believes it is time for change
2874457 eating the fish is like chewing a piece of rubber and the juice is served as dessert thats not fair
2874458 the increase of fee is happening every year because of the increase of prices in our local market making it the only factor for the cafeteria fee to increase
2874459 but the dorm managers requested to decrease the fee because students have to pay many other fees so the cafeteria decided to increase it only by 10 so thats p2900
2874460 we want quality food some dormers even resort to eating out because the food does not taste good
2874461 we decided not to allow pageant coaches and make up artists because based on experience they are usually the ones who cause chaos especially at the backstage they are noisy and they disrupt the flow of the event sometimes
2874462 it will make the pageant more challenging more interesting and perhaps more real
2874463 we want their ideas their original work and not someone elses we also have a group of students who will sit with them to edit their speeches for any grammatical and syntactical errors and to clarify vague ideas
2874464 this increase of fare rates that was petitioned by mch drivers is quite reasonable given the weekly increase of prices of fuel in local gasoline stations
2874465 the fare is getting so expensive i wouldnt be surprised that people will start walking because we cant afford to pay for tricycle fare
2874466 its not the increase in prices the commuters are angry about rather it is the arrogance and the unpleasant attitudes of the motorcab drivers who sometimes overcharge
2874467 the government should give all the assistance they can to the students
2874468 the funds to support such scholarship must be taken from tuition revenues
2874469 sometimes its not about kicks marks and handballs its what you do for the team
2874470 too bad i cant get on it it would sink
2874471 the best synth site on the web always updated always interesting
2874472 you do a great job maintaining that blog it has become essential daily viewing for myself and lots of other people i know your efforts are greatly appreciated

2874475 i think that the matrixsynth blog is great and keeps people well in touch with everything synth i visit everyday to see whats going on

2874478 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2874479 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2874480 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2874481 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2874482 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2874483 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2874484 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2874485 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2874486 but thanks to the farming machinery we now use for harvesting old men like me can continue working
2874487 in the past onion cultivation was tough as we had to cut the stems with a sickle carry bundles of onions each weighing more than three kilograms and climb up and down a ladder to hang bundles
2874488 but thanks to the farming machinery we now use for harvesting old men like me can continue working
2874489 onions from awajishima are flavorsome and sweet and match nakamurayas curries

2874497 there were two bombings one at the kojori military base and another on mt makhata as far as i know there are no casualties
2874498 i was very firm with vladimir putin i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia
2874499 coming back to the table negotiations peace talks a political solution thats it easy to say very difficult to do
2874500 it is the most surreal world crisis i could ever imagine
2874501 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia
2874502 here we are trying to promote peace and harmony and were witnessing a conflict take place
2874503 there needs to be international mediation for the south ossetia issue
2874504 im coming clean without telling you anything you dont already know out of respect for my family
2874505 there is a deep and abiding love that exists between elizabeth and myself its always been there it in my judgment has never gone away
2874506 love her christ i hardly even like her my mistake was a tight little hole i slipped into a few times in 2006 thats why im studiously avoiding using my mistakes name
2874507 the one thing that im jealous of is that you guys dont have cellulite
2874508 as part of the primary consumers of the goods and services of the city we do not feel the protection of our law enforcement agencies in the midst of our daily activities
2874509 it is still fresh in our memory how a criminal perpetrator took the life of a fellow student in the four walls of her residence most of us were affected by the incident
2874510 this became an eye opener for us to and prompted us to pursue vigilance against crime
2874511 this is but an example of the many experiences we have encountered and we hope this will be minimized if not totally eradicated
2874512 its the start of something that can be great weve been waiting for years for this moment
2874513 i dont know how many people were watching the game but it was an honor to play in it
2874514 we were all excited and anxious this game was over the top
2874515 but we have a saying back home that when youre good you play for the name on the front of your jersey instead of the name on the back our guys all play for the name on the front of their jersey
2874516 i had told myself long ago that three books in a series are enough for my attention span and so after
2874517 prayerfully i decided to return to gresham setting the story fifteen years after julia hollis and her children first left london for abandoned coaching inn which became larkspur inn i believe readers would like to see how the children philip aleda and grace elizabeth and laurel turn out as adults but i like to inject fresh faces into every book hence jewel libby and her daughter becky find gresham a haven from a bad man writing the book was like coming home visiting old friends
2874518 it equips teenagers with the information and skills they need to negotiate their way through the adolescent years and build meaningful lives
2874519 the series has been designed as a preventative strategy for combatting teen suicide pregnancy and depression
2874520 unfortunately some young people are struggling with suicide sex drugs alcohol and a general lack of direction which is robbing them of their true potential
2874521 attitude works in partnership with teachers to cover strands of the health curriculum via our presentations and range of handbooks teaching resources and video clips
2874522 weve received positive feedback from students all over the country they engage with the presentations because we combine the important facts with humour and actually get them thinking
2874523 sense of injustice of loss of the cruelty of the world
2874524 our nation has undergone more than 80 years of this humiliation
2874525 become complicit to the creation of a magical elixir that will dance on your tongue and linger cooing sweet sounds to your taste buds
2874526 you can make a mistake and get caught in a submission but chuck made a mistake and he got caught in an ass whoopin
2874527 yeah the poor and the ordinary you know like sick people
2874528 and i treat them for free the hospital gets paid but i dont
2874529 maybe someday well have national health insurance and then they wont be screwed so much
2874530 i was horrified to learn that he hadnt been contacted about the change in arrangements
2874531 ive apologised and weve had a good discussion about that
2874532 we need to have a greater understanding of what is happening now in our schools
2874533 for a long time acer has published pieces from educational researchers decrying the lack of transparency about funding systems and about who attends and what happens in australian schools
2874534 i know you have concluded that politicians lack the will to put a spotlight on this vital information
2874535 can i assure you the rudd labor government does not lack the political courage
2874536 consequently the use of national testing data should be contained to the purpose of informing teaching and learning in the classroom and individual reporting to parents
2874537 data collected for one purpose is often inappropriate for another purpose
2874538 the essence of league tables is you take one little thing and whack it in a list and say thats all you need to know about your local school
2874539 what we want to know is very comprehensive information about who is in each school because that would tell you something about educational need
2874540 we need to know where that disadvantage lies and we need to know the best methods of addressing it
2874541 so what is this small batch stuff is this just more marketing crap dreamed up by distillers
2874542 you are the light of the world a city set on a hill cannot be hidden nor does anyone light a lamp and put it under a basket but on the lampstand and it gives light to all who are in the house let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works and glorify your father who is in heaven
2874543 but the people who know their god will be strong and carry out great exploits
2874544 now in the second year of nebuchadnezzars reign nebuchadnezzar had dreams and his spirit was so troubled that his sleep left him
2874545 i have had a dream and my spirit is anxious to know the dream
2874546 my decision is firm if you do not make known the dream to me and its interpretation you shall be cut in pieces and your houses shall be made an ash heap
2874547 for this reason the king was angry and very furious and gave a command to destroy all the wise men of babylon so the decree went out and they began killing the wise men and they sought daniel and his companions to kill them
2874548 but now the righteousness of god without the law is manifested being witnessed by the law and the prophets v 22 even the righteousness of god which is by faith of jesus christ unto all and upon all them that believe for there is no difference v 23 for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god v 24 being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in christ jesus v 25 whom god hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past through the forbearance of god v 26 to declare i say at this time his righteousness that he might be just and the justifier of him which believeth in jesus v 27 where is boasting then it is excluded by what law of works nay but by the law of faith v 28 therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law v 29 is he the god of the jews only is he not also of the gentiles yes of the gentiles also v 30 seeing it is one god which shall justify the circumcision by faith and uncircumcision through faith v 31 do we then make void the law through faith god forbid yea we establish the law
2874549 if you want to win the ultimate crown you must separate yourself and work hard
2874550 lets go meet my buddies i want them to know what youve learned
2874551 oh i dont know thats up to you just say something speak college to em talk the way you do at college
2874552 what a waste of time and money to send you to that college everybody knows that pie are round
2874553 if youre are going to make any gains you will have to take some risks
2874554 about taking risks you said last week that you have to take risks to gain anything
2874555 i got a check this week for some work i did a couple of months ago and i took it as a sign from the lord i put the whole check toward lottery tickets the jackpot rolled over last night and its already up to 25 million i promised god that when i win im going to tithe the winnings to the church
2874556 you dont get to choose how youre going to die or when you can decide how youre going to live now
2874557 i had much to write to you but i would rather not write with pen and ink i hope to see you soon and we will talk face to face
2874558 peace be to you the friends greet you greet the friends every one of them
2874559 listen to another parable there was a landowner who planted a vineyard
2874560 the tenants seized his servants they beat one killed another and stoned a third 36 then he sent other servants to them more than the first time and the tenants treated them the same way 37 last of all he sent his son to them they will respect my son he said
2874561 but when the tenants saw the son they said to each other this is the heir come lets kill him and take his inheritance 39 so they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him
2874562 therefore when the owner of the vineyard comes what will he do to those tenants
2874563 and he will rent the vineyard to other tenants who will give him his share of the crop at harvest time
2874564 therefore i tell you that the kingdom of god will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit 44 he who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces but he on whom it falls will be crushed
2874565 you shall love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind
2874566 the second is like it you shall love your neighbor as yourself
2874567 our heavenly father give us a good sense a good mind and a good heart so that we will understand your words inspire us as we learn so that we will live a life in accordance with your will in jesus christ our lord amen i have entitled my message this morning as a question why cannot christians just get along i will say that again why cannot christians just get along god created us human being to enjoy intimate relationship with him and not only that but with one another and when jesus christ becomes the lord of these two relationships we will be able to experience the meaningful intimacy that was part of gods original plan however so much has changed since that first relational encounter at creation our relationships then have become damaged and fractured by sin as human beings we live in relationship with other human beings and there is no escaping from it god made us to live in harmony with one another also nature shows that we are meant to exit in relationships god made us to be in relationship with other people and yet no matter how basic to our existence and identity as humans something has gone wrong with our relationships and all around us we can see examples of relationships gone sour relationships gone really badly most of the pain and heartache we suffer as humans we suffer because of bad relationships but let me remind you this morning that god loves us and he obviously cares about our relationships which form such an important part of our existence god wants us to have good healthy affirming relationships i want you to understand this folks that our interactions with others the true measure of our walk with christ will be revealed how you treat others reveals your relationship with god so where is christ in your relationship now where is christ in your relationship with god and your relationship with others if christ is not lord of your relationships with others then the devil will take over and we will experience damaged and fractured relationships and that will hinder gods work why cannot christians just get along there two main kinds of relationships that christians are concerned with one is their relationship with god and second is their relationship with other human beings our text this morning tells us that jesus spoke of two great commandments that
2874568 the second is like it is that you shall love your neighbor as yourself
2874569 this is why you are condemned because you committed one of the above
2874570 come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light
2874571 he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things
2874572 the suffering of christs messengers ministers to those they are trying to reach and may open them to the gospel
2874573 wormwood the church is fertile field if you keep them bickering over details structure money property personal hurts and misunderstandings one thing you must prevent dont ever let christians look up and see the banner of victory flying because youll lose them never let them see the glory of god
2874574 who then is the faithful and wise manager whom the master puts in charge of his servants to give them their food allowance at the proper time it will be good for that servant whom the master finds doing so when he returns
2874575 i am the way the truth and the life no one comes to the father accept through me
2874576 i will destroy the wisdom of the wise the intelligence of the intelligent i will frustrate

2874581 i am about to die but god will surely take care of you and bring you up from this land to the land which he promised on oath to abraham to isaac and to jacob and joseph took an oath of the children of israel saying god will surely visit you and you shall carry my bones from this place
2874582 by faith joseph when his end was near spoke about the exodus of the israelites from egypt and gave instructions about his bones
2874583 rabbi we know you are a teacher who has come from god for no one could perform the miraculous signs you are doing if god were not with him
2874584 i tell you the truth no one can see the kingdom of god unless he is born again

2874596 the evidence to date is that a significant moderation in demand is now occurring and it is looking more likely the demand will remain subdued and economic growth will be fairly slow in the period ahead
2874597 while inflation is likely to remain high in the short term the board judged at its august meeting that demand was slowing to an extent that could be expected to bring about a significant reduction in inflation over time
2874598 on this basis the board decided that the existing monetary policy setting was appropriate for the time being
2874599 on the assumption that the subdued demand conditions are like to continue scope to move to a less restrictive monetary policy stance in the period ahead is increasing

2874615 we are fundamentally responding to the call of the fruit traders who fear that the lingering economic blockade on kashmir would rot their produce but if it involves sharing the stage with the separatists we have no problem with that
2874616 it is our right to work with our people in search of an alternative trading route if punjab can trade across the wagah attari border why not kashmir
2874617 we know what they are up to it is sheer vote bank politics for them if they try to join us they will not be welcome
2874618 it is the party that gave the land in the first place

2874621 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2874622 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2874623 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2874624 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2874625 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

2874629 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2874630 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2874631 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2874632 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2874633 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2874634 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2874635 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2874636 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2874637 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2874638 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2874639 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2874640 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2874641 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2874642 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2874643 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2874644 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2874645 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2874646 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2874647 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2874648 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2874649 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2874650 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2874651 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2874652 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2874653 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2874654 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2874655 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2874656 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2874657 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2874658 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2874659 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2874660 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2874661 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2874662 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2874663 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2874664 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
2874665 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2874666 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2874667 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2874668 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2874669 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2874670 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2874671 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2874672 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2874673 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2874674 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2874675 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2874676 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2874677 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2874678 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2874679 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2874680 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2874681 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2874682 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2874683 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2874684 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2874685 the deadlock in the case of the hate crime is disappointing in many ways
2874686 and clearly demonstrates the need to continue educating the public about what constitutes a hate crime we have work to do to ensure that this type of behavior does not recur and is never ever tolerated or condoned
2874687 full and equal recognition of our relationships means that we have crossed a final barrier toward full and equal citizenship at least in california this day has been years in the making but we know we cant celebrate for long
2874688 today we celebrate today we savor the full and equal recognition of our relationships our families and all the responsibilities that come with it but tomorrow we organize our equality did not come easily we will not let it go

2874695 though ross is keen on bringing in capital he may not do it on original terms
2874696 that is why there is no question of triggering an open offer after breaching the 15 stakeholding as per sebi rules or hitting the ceiling of 49 on foreign direct investment
2874697 it has started delaying payment of aircraft lease rentals to lessors due to paucity of working capital

2874712 the first time i visited lifelovebeauty com i was struck by the whole girl power theme but there are male readers that visit the site regularly too speaking as someone who has been an absolute goofball in my own pursuits of romance through the years i can hardly wait to read the stories the contest entrants write about what theyve done for love

2874716 i have really focused hard on the majors the last two years
2874717 i have turned up to other events and unless i get into contention it feels like a race or a sprint
2874718 where as a major feels like a marathon i feel like i can be patient and take my time i love the feeling of knowing that it is going to come down to the back nine and who can do it under pressure on the last nine holes
2874719 i am a great believer in making it your own responsibility whether you win or dont win i knew i was playing catch up and those are the moments that change tournaments when you take shots on and they come off and you have to do it on the back nine you are not going to win any other way
2874720 i had a discussion with my trainer back home and it was possible i was dehydrated
2874721 so that gave me something to focus on i focused on re hydrating myself whether that was the cause or not i dont know it might have just been tiredness
2874722 but at least i had something tangible that i could pin it on and try to put effort into it and it gave me the belief that if i get my hydration right my co ordination would come back

2874766 we are not operating in any way which may counter israeli interests we have turned down many requests involving arms sales to georgia and the ones which have been approves have been duly scrutinized so far we have placed no limitations on the sale of protective measures
2874767 they contacted defense industry officials and arms dealers and told them that georgia had relatively large budgets and could be interested in purchasing israeli weapons
2874768 his door was always open to the israelis who came and offered his country arms systems made in israel
2874769 compared to countries in eastern europe the deals in this country were conducted fast mainly due to the defense ministers personal involvement
2874770 it was clear that too many unmistakable israeli systems in the possesion of the georgian army would be like a red cloth in the face of a raging bull as far as russia is concerned
2874771 and that the interception of three of these rpvs in the past three months was an expression of this anger not everyone in israel understood the sensitive nerve israel touched when it supplied such an advanced arms system to a country whose relations with russia are highly tense
2874772 we conducted a small job for them several years ago
2874773 the israeli is the main investor in the georgian economy everyone is there directly or indirectly
2874774 the israelis should be proud of themselves for the israeli training and education received by the georgian soldiers
2874775 we are now in a fight against the great russia
2874776 and our hope is to receive assistance from the white house because georgia cannot survive on its own
2874777 its important that the entire world understands that what is happening in georgia now will affect the entire world order its not just georgias business but the entire worlds business
2874778 we need help from the un and from our friends headed by the united states and israel today georgia is in danger tomorrow all the democratic countries in the region and in the entire world will be in danger too

2874793 we are turning carbon dioxide into carbonic acid and then making carbonate all we need is water and pollution
2874794 for every ton of cement made half a ton of carbon dioxide is sequestered
2874795 we probably have the best carbon capture and storage technique there is by a long shot
2874796 we are actively working with our banks to develop a longer term agreement and we are confident that we will be able to complete a long term solution by the expiration of august 26 2008 additionally we are continuing to streamline our costs build our leadership team and focus on growth and improved financial performance

2874806 ive apologised and weve had a good discussion about that its a very unfortunate set of circumstances
2874807 the evidence to date is that a significant moderation in demand is now occurring and it is looking more likely the demand will remain subdued and economic growth will be fairly slow in the period ahead
2874808 while inflation is likely to remain high in the short term the board judged at its august meeting that demand was slowing to an extent that could be expected to bring about a significant reduction in inflation over time
2874809 on this basis the board decided that the existing monetary policy setting was appropriate for the time being
2874810 on the assumption that the subdued demand conditions are like to continue scope to move to a less restrictive monetary policy stance in the period ahead is increasing
2874811 the combination of falls in housing and equity prices means that household net wealth has declined in the first half of this year
2874812 cpi inflation is expected to be higher in the short term at around 5 per cent in the december quarter reflecting the effects of higher petrol prices and the recent correction to estimates of financial services inflation before declining thereafter
2874813 a move in november is a likelihood rather than september
2874814 theres still a fair bit of talk of elevated inflation and that suggests theyll wait for the next cpi before they move
2874815 the way this statement reads its just a little bit of hosing down how excited the market was getting for a 50 basis point rate cut
2874816 when they do start to cut its more likely to be a smaller cut rather than big cuts
2874817 the reserve banks been pretty clear and lucid in terms of slowing growth and is signalling rate cuts are not too far off
2874818 we certainly think well get one in the next few months and certainly by early next year
2874819 were actually saying november or just within the next three months and certainly one will be in by february

2874874 israel is not a legitimate entity and no amount of pressure can force us to recognize its right to exist
2874875 the evidence to date is that a significant moderation in demand is now occurring and it is looking more likely the demand will remain subdued and economic growth will be fairly slow in the period ahead
2874876 while inflation is likely to remain high in the short term the board judged at its august meeting that demand was slowing to an extent that could be expected to bring about a significant reduction in inflation over time
2874877 on this basis the board decided that the existing monetary policy setting was appropriate for the time being
2874878 on the assumption that the subdued demand conditions are like to continue scope to move to a less restrictive monetary policy stance in the period ahead is increasing
2874879 the combination of falls in housing and equity prices means that household net wealth has declined in the first half of this year

2874881 pensamos que la mejor forma de celebrarlo el cumplea os de fidel era trabajando en la agricultura que es una de las batallas principales que tiene en este momento nuestro pa s en la producci n de alimentos

2874885 now were starting up and this is where everything begins for me im going to work hard move through the best i can and then try to help this organization out
2874886 its nothing like getting out there and being able to walk on the field and see what these guys get to play on every day
2874887 everybody in the park knew we were going to be teammates hopefully someday
2874888 i knew that im sure he knew that it was just kind of the heat of the moment we were still trying to win for our college programs
2874889 actividades vinculadas con operaciones de autotransporte representan un peligro imminente para el p blico
2874890 creo que dios se vali de esta tragedia para fortalecer nuestra fe realmente creo eso
2874891 it was great to hear how many people were watching the show
2874892 people would come up to us and say they watched us on tv
2874893 we dont rehearse jokes or perform different takes its all totally improvised
2874894 our prior forecasts were accurate but widely disbelieved when issued
2874895 we similarly expect a skeptical reaction now to a recovery forecast which is not the common view but the numbers are what they are
2874896 i hear theyre not letting you guys get too drunk out there well they didnt tell me so im going to have a drink
2874897 im not the one telling you do to this god is if youre rejecting this teaching youre rejecting gods authority
2874898 its impossible youre flesh amp blood just like anyone else
2874899 with men it is impossible but not with god for with god all things are possible
2874900 should be instinctual for christians were new creations in christ amp have a new nature since we are now part of the body of christ thus we should super naturally love one another keep in mind that love is the defining characteristic of a believer in christ john 13 34 35 34 a new commandment i give to you that you love one another as i have loved you that you also love one another 35 by this all will know that you are my disciples if you have love for one another
2874901 do good to all especially to those who are of the household of faith
2874902 it is amazing how much wisdom people have about other peoples affairs and so little interest in their own
2874903 then we turned and journeyed into the wilderness of the way of the red sea as the
2874904 you are about to pass through the territory of your brethren the descendants of esau who live in seir and they will be afraid of you therefore watch yourselves carefully 5 do not meddle with them for i will not give you any of their land no not so much as one footstep because i have given mount seir to esau theyre family esau amp jacob israel were brothers feuded much in their day due to esaus complacency towards his birthright amp jacobs conniving to get it but supposedly reconciled in gen 33 after jacob had been humbled by laban his father in law they seem to have met again only once after that death of isaac and apparently esaus children nursed the grudge as weve been forgiven much may we always be quick to forgive amp not let grudges get established god gave them their land just as god is giving israel its own land we dont know that god made a covenantal agreement with edom but it was still his gift to them and israel had no right to take what wasnt theirs israel wasnt going to canaan to build an empire they were gaining an inheritance likewise some in christendom believe its their right to declare dominion over all the earth they miss the fact that weve been given an inheritance we simply receive what god graciously gives us we dont have to take anything by force lord your god has blessed you in all the work of your hand he knows your trudging through this great wilderness these forty years the god is faithful hes going to provide for the hebrews exactly what he thinks they need thus they dont need to go coveting after everyone elses land it comes down to a matter of trust god has always been faithful to provide for us in the past why do we doubt him for the present joshua amp memorial stones joshua 4 6 7 6 that this may be a sign among you when your children ask in time to come saying what do these stones mean to you 7 then you shall answer them that the waters of the jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the lord when it crossed over the jordan the waters of the jordan were cut off and these stones shall be for a memorial to the children of israel forever
2874905 and when we passed beyond our brethren the descendants of esau who dwell in seir away from the road of the plain away from elath and ezion geber we turned and passed by way of the wilderness of moab
2874906 now rise and cross over the valley of the zered so we crossed over the valley of the zered
2874907 so it was when all the men of war had finally perished from among the people
2874908 rise take your journey and cross over the river arnon look i have given into your hand sihon the amorite king of heshbon and his land begin to possess
2874909 and i sent messengers from the wilderness of kedemoth to sihon king of heshbon with words of peace saying
2874910 but sihon king of heshbon would not let us pass through for the
2874911 then we turned and went up the road to bashan and og king of bashan came out against us he and all his people to battle at edrei
2874912 the lord the lord god merciful and gracious longsuffering and abounding in goodness and truth 7 keeping mercy for thousands forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin by no means clearing the guilty visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and the childrens children to the third and the fourth generation
2874913 and at that time we took the land from the hand of the two kings of the amorites who
2874914 for only og king of bashan remained of the remnant of the giants indeed his bedstead
2874915 what they received was good but what they refused to receive was better many believers appropriate the truth of justification by faith rom 3 4 but they never recognize their position in christ rom 6 1 10 and claim the power of it rom 6 11
2874916 and i commanded joshua at that time saying your eyes have seen all that the
2874917 god you have just gotten started i havent seen anything yet

2874973 i left teaching because i realized that before i got a little older than what i am 25 if i was going to make this
2874974 worry is like a rocking chair it gives you something to do but it doesnt get you anywhere
2874975 bueno mira vamos a alambrar esto porque ac vamos a tener los animales a medias
2874976 is a story but its also a platform for ideas i think people like the gossip girl connection the idea of people watching and talking about each other is something thats very real to their lives
2874977 when i first found out what a showrunner was i thought it was the strangest job i had heard of in my life
2874978 when someones a writer its very creative and moody and you think of someone walking around the office in pajamas thinking of ideas on the other hand as a television producer you have to be buttoned up organized and a feed the machine type of person the idea that those two creatures were supposed to inhabit the same body was really a strange thing
2874979 when they sent me the books i said ill do this if stephanie does this
2874980 shes really tapped into young women and whats exciting for them i knew the material was a little female weighted for someone as ignorant of the female species as myself and stephanie would have great insight into it
2874981 i was excited it was this world that i loved and felt wasnt represented enough on tv
2874982 there was so much in the book there were very bold characters and i felt like there was a way to add humanity and dimensionality to them
2874983 first i need to become an alcoholic go to rehab and lose all my money
2874984 wait i dont have any money so id have to get it first and then lose it
2874985 my mind is in new york but i would love to live in argentina drink red wine and write poetry no one understands
2874986 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2874987 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2874988 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2874989 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2874990 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2874991 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2874992 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2874993 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2874994 i thought my god what do i have to do to beat this guy it was discouraging
2874995 i know my diet sucks but i still dont understand why i cant lose my fat
2874996 every time i work with my trainer i get injured
2874997 i was horrified to learn that he hadnt been contacted about the change in arrangements
2874998 ive apologised and weve had a good discussion about that its a very unfortunate set of circumstances
2874999 without diminishing the callous and brutal nature of this crime which was certainly committed partly for financial gain and with no regard to the sanctity of human life i believe that a determinate sentence is appropriate
2875000 my client states his instructions are that ben clark acted alone and that is what we maintained throughout the trial and unfortunately the jury did not accept that
2875001 we australians know were not good at some things like investing and ensuring enough money for retirement even more interesting is that we know its important to learn more about the things where our confidence is lacking and a lot of us want to manage our money better
2875002 its easy to say that moneys boring or money isnt important to be happy in life or to put off doing something about it because you think its just too hard the findings of this research show that a lot of people think just that
2875003 the main reason we put the most important things off is that we usually dont make a commitment to schedule the time to reflect and bring the unconscious awareness into conscious action items
2875004 over the last 12 months like many property investors and owners i have been anxious about what the property and finance markets will bring over the next few years i have been more anxious than what i would like to admit in public as i am expected to know the answers
2875005 for quite a while i have been confused by the fact that property prices have been going up at least up till now in australia while the opposite has been happening in the us amp uk particularly while money has become less and less available for mortgages in all these countries
2875006 i disliked the feeling of confusion and uncertainty about our current economic environment so much so that i went into a period of intensive study and research through my research i am happy to say that i was able to understand what has happened and what will happen next in the property and finance markets in australia and around the world
2875007 then i went through a period of self examination including some of the key beliefs i hold in relation to capital property finance business career growth cash flow systems leadership productivity relationships family passion talent duty amp purpose etc
2875008 this self examination exercise revealed to me that some of my expectations were ahead of my reality that there were gaps between what is the truth and what i observe to be the truth and most importantly that what has worked for most property investors in the last 20 years may not work over the next 20 years
2875009 i must admit that it is so hard to question things that have worked for us so well for so long and see the merits of other options if we are given only two options to choose i wonder which one is harder for most people 1 wrong but wealthy or 2 right but broke
2875010 through my research and self examination i decided to make some major changes to the way i invest in properties and run businesses and more significantly the way i would like to conduct myself in other areas of my life
2875011 its little wonder that most people rely on their financial advisers and accountants for their financial advice they are experts in their field and what they can do more so than say family members banks or newspapers is explain to you how events in the wider economy can affect you personally
2875012 experts in their field are always better equipped to distil what are very complex and intricate issues and explain how they are likely to specifically effect your own personal situation so in times like these its very wise to seek these people out and listen to what they have to say
2875013 markets are in for one of the most amazing turnarounds ever seen entire commodity boom looks like busting this is just the start of a pullback it is very feasible to get downside targets into the 70 65 zone

2875016 with its bellicose behavior the west is pushing iran towards nuclear weapons even if they dont want them now
2875017 you need jesus in your life to set to free you from sin lest you go to hell and perish
2875018 the only reason youre conscious right now is because i dont want to carry you
2875019 for the record i have never been interviewed by matthew hooton about nuclear power and i have never said to anyone in public or in private whether after a glass of wine or not that nuclear power might ever need to be part of new zealands energy mix
2875020 what i have said repeatedly in many forums is that nuclear power does not fit new zealands electricity system and would be hugely expensive here
2875021 i think many of our problems as a country would be solved if people had thick passports
2875022 theres just no substitute for actually going and seeing things
2875023 you start to feel a level of responsibility to direct attention to things that actually matter more than to silly things like who youre dating
2875024 for a lot of actors our biggest fear is that were going to start talking about things we dont fully understand and sound like idiots
2875025 in the long run ill do much more good if when i open my mouth i have something worth saying

2875139 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2875140 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2875141 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2875142 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2875143 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2875144 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2875145 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2875146 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2875153 he gave me the opportunity to make a play and he put it out there far enough he put enough air up under it where i could run and go get it
2875154 he kind of held the safety up so the safety wouldnt get over there and zipped it in there
2875155 there were a couple of mistakes in terms of the ballhandling where he went one way the back went the other way
2875156 were 25 plays into it so theres going to be some of that
2875157 obviously he let a lot of people down i feel for elizabeth but you know the public is forgiving obviously this is something between himself and his family and voters you know i feel for that family i still believe that john edwards is committed to reducing poverty i think his concern in the campaign was genuine

2875196 when they do start to cut its more likely to be a smaller cut rather than big cuts
2875197 the reserve banks been pretty clear and lucid in terms of slowing growth and is signalling rate cuts are not too far off

2875239 the evidence to date is that a significant moderation in demand is now occurring and it is looking more likely the demand will remain subdued and economic growth will be fairly slow in the period ahead
2875240 while inflation is likely to remain high in the short term the board judged at its august meeting that demand was slowing to an extent that could be expected to bring about a significant reduction in inflation over time
2875241 on this basis the board decided that the existing monetary policy setting was appropriate for the time being

2875250 the 10 000 barrier has been breached as hedge funds continue to be formed in the cayman islands which remains the clear jurisdiction of choice for investment managers and their advisers around the world
2875251 business remains active and the volatility which has impacted world markets as a result of the credit crisis and the relatively weak valuations of many securities has provided hedge fund managers with great opportunities to create alpha after a number of years of relatively flat returns hedge funds have also provided the market with much needed liquidity which has been especially beneficial amid the current tight lending conditions
2875252 there have been some forced closures but in the cases where funds are struggling the managers we work with are being pro active by placing hard to value securities in side pockets suspending redemptions and imposing gates such measures may enable a fund in distress to ride out the storm or to wind down its affairs in an orderly manner
2875253 in the cayman islands the key drivers behind the actions being taken are the need to treat all investors equitably and to act in the best interests of the fund and this provides a firm foundation for protecting market participants and preserving value

2875332 l a county reviewed everything purchased in last three years as did most counties in the state
2875333 i guess you could say i caught a falling knife
2875334 when i bought prices were already 10 to 15 percent off their high then they kept falling

2875336 it depends on the jurisdiction but there are accounts of properties being 30 to 60 percent over assessed

2875341 the assessors office even admitted they didnt have a lot to go on they had to base the assessment on houses that were kind of nearby but not really a few miles away its a whole different neighborhood
2875342 i went online and found all of the recently sold homes
2875343 it took me time to walk all over the neighborhood and i wrote down numbers of the homes that matched our model
2875344 if we get a high number of appeals in a certain section we sometimes will go back and adjust the entire section based on the grade or quality of construction so the appeal of a few may affect several

2875428 most countries have publicly owned railways its the usual state of things and in a country like ours with a low population density and a large land area the idea of a profitable private railway is a nonsense you either subsidise the private operator or you do it yourself and invest to build better services
2875429 labour has made the justice system considerably more punitive especially for more serious criminals but that has not had the effect that proponents of such solutions want it has led to higher prison populations but i would bet anything that it is not a cause of the lower crime we are seeing across the country these days
2875430 the evidence to date is that a significant moderation in demand is now occurring and it is looking more likely the demand will remain subdued and economic growth will be fairly slow in the period ahead
2875431 while inflation is likely to remain high in the short term the board judged at its august meeting that demand was slowing to an extent that could be expected to bring about a significant reduction in inflation over time
2875432 on this basis the board decided that the existing monetary policy setting was appropriate for the time being
2875433 on the assumption that the subdued demand conditions are like to continue scope to move to a less restrictive monetary policy stance in the period ahead is increasing

2875468 cpi inflation is expected to be higher in the short term at around 5 per cent in the december quarter reflecting the effects of higher petrol prices and the recent correction to estimates of financial services inflation before declining thereafter
2875469 a move in november is a likelihood rather than september
2875470 theres still a fair bit of talk of elevated inflation and that suggests theyll wait for the next cpi before they move
2875471 the way this statement reads its just a little bit of hosing down how excited the market was getting for a 50 basis point rate cut
2875472 when they do start to cut its more likely to be a smaller cut rather than big cuts
2875473 the reserve banks been pretty clear and lucid in terms of slowing growth and is signalling rate cuts are not too far off
2875474 we certainly think well get one in the next few months and certainly by early next year

2875510 we need to have a greater understanding of what is happening now in our schools
2875511 for a long time acer has published pieces from educational researchers decrying the lack of transparency about funding systems and about who attends and what happens in australian schools
2875512 i know you have concluded that politicians lack the will to put a spotlight on this vital information
2875513 can i assure you the rudd labor government does not lack the political courage
2875514 consequently the use of national testing data should be contained to the purpose of informing teaching and learning in the classroom and individual reporting to parents
2875515 data collected for one purpose is often inappropriate for another purpose
2875516 the essence of league tables is you take one little thing and whack it in a list and say thats all you need to know about your local school
2875517 what we want to know is very comprehensive information about who is in each school because that would tell you something about educational need
2875518 we need to know where that disadvantage lies and we need to know the best methods of addressing it

2875528 were past the point of last year where the question was will iptv scale
2875529 you cant get to that number 126 000 subscribers without significant flow through and automation we do have a competitive service and we can do it to scale
2875530 well be able to do more channels in the same amount of bandwidth
2875531 very different from cable and satellite because the nature of ip allows for easier integration among services while also allowing it to take advantage of internet partners such as
2875532 cinema center that allows movies to be purchased from amazon with one click the movie portal content would be dynamic and would allow subscribers to view trailers prior to making their purchases
2875533 we dont have to create this stuff in ip because it reaches out to web devices and incorporates them into iptv hill said
2875534 the 300 million fiber to the node project is not intended as a deployment of iptv
2875535 will focus on 20 markets with the project 10 of its largest and 10 others

2875562 strength coordination and endurance diminish in old age these are precisely the things that martial arts can train very well
2875563 only people around 50 or older are in the special jukuren courses
2875564 it makes no sense for them to train together with 20 year olds
2875565 practising the exercises is the important thing not tests of ability or participation in competitions
2875566 in advanced age physical contact in all martial arts should be avoided
2875567 its simply too dangerous to be thrown to the mat after a certain age
2875568 people of all ages have usually been advised to engage in endurance sports
2875569 its tragic how many older people are assaulted for their wallet or simply out of arrogance and take a nasty fall
2875570 the first thing i teach older beginners is a very simple exercise according to the teachings of asian martial arts if you are grabbed from behind all you have got to do is press an extremely painful pressure point on your opponents ear and all thats required for that is just the index finger
2875571 nevertheless this malaysian tree shrew is never drunk this suggests a beneficial effect and sheds a whole new light on the evolution of human alcoholism
2875572 the pen tailed tree shrew is considered a living model for extinct mammals representing the stock from which all extinct and living tree shrews and primates radiated
2875573 therefore we hypothesize that moderate to high alcohol intake was present early on in the evolution of these closely related lineages
2875574 alcohol use and abuse can no longer be blamed on the inventors of brewing of about 9 000 years ago
2875575 so far the current theories on alcoholism have stated that mankind and its ancestors were either used to taking no alcohol at all or maybe only low doses via fruits before the onset of beer brewing
2875576 as brewing is such a recent event on the evolutionary time scale we were not able to develop an adequate defence against the adverse effects of alcohol and the partly hereditary addiction mankind is suffering from an evolutionary hangover
2875577 alcohol consuming tree shrews are not real shrews in fact they belong to the primates closest living relatives and are ecologically and behaviourally comparable to their extinct ancestors that lived more than 55 million years ago
2875578 studying these fascinating creatures is an unexpected golden opportunity to learn about the causes and consequences of real life drinking

2875643 de overlast valt in het algemeen wel mee omdat de meeste bezoekers hun telefoon op de trilstand zetten
2875644 het zijn vooral de ouderen die zich ergeren aan het besmuikte gebruik van de mobiele telefoon
2875645 we hebben nu eenmaal te maken met een generatie jongeren die helemaal is opgegroeid met de mobiele telefoon die storen zich er ook niet aan als hun leeftijdgenoten tijdens een film zitten te smsen
2875646 maar dan moeten de serven ook de europese waarden en normen overnemen dat wil zeggen oorlogsverdachten overhandigen voor berechting

2875651 theyre using them to drive from residence halls to class which is a two or three block commute
2875652 we thought how can we provide an incentive to get them out of that behavior
2875653 i think a big draw is the just the environmental aspect
2875654 and honestly i think that anything free when youre in college is good especially something like a bike that is worth something
2875655 ive had two bikes stolen so i stopped buying bikes because they kept stealing them

2875657 let there be no doubt in your minds that the dominant political forces at work in pakistan today are competing to appease and please the modern day crusaders in the white house and are working to destabilize this nuclear capable nation under the aegis of america
2875658 dont allow the fruits of the victory achieved through the sacrifices of the mujahedeen fighting in afghanistan iraq and the tribal belt of pakistan to be hijacked by the politicians who sat passively while the girls and boys of the red mosque perished and burned
2875659 these are the same politicians who follow the tenets of an alien western democratic system and judiciary and exploit islam to fulfill their own greedy aims
2875660 the take home message here is its a big deal
2875661 its probably the biggest impact in the shortest time that i can think of
2875662 if i can use some of that heat energy and convert it to electricity you can improve the overall efficiency
2875663 there are several other steps that are required to commercialize the material but were cautiously optimistic that these steps can be carried out successfully
2875664 we think we can make people feel cooler more quickly feel comfortable more quickly and that will translate into less power in the central ac system
2875665 russia had to move in if only to save face
2875666 should russia confine its efforts to south ossetia it still might emerge out of this mess as the power who moved in to stop bloodshed
2875667 should russia move further into georgia it will be deemed the aggressor
2875668 today we feel better about it we know were going to get him back

2875670 they were always the hometown airline they were in the downtown parades they invested in the community
2875671 we have a number of businesses that depend on good air service
2875672 its going to be much harder for us to convince a high tech company that they should come here it hurts
2875673 we have a few airports out there that i think are spending more than they should quite frankly and so there are some real total airport cost increases that we are very vocal about
2875674 the more you raise fees the more you drive airlines and customers away
2875675 its rhetoric ive heard for 41 years but i understand
2875676 these folks arent sure if theyre going to be in business in six months
2875677 this may come as relief to you you will always be alone crowded rooms busy streets it doesnt matter your solitude will be with you always you will wake up alone mornings of all four seasons and go to sleep the same way the years will pass and you will witness you body slowly showing the ravages of time of course there will be intermittent crossing of paths with a women be assured all thes liasons will be short lived if you are not immediately distracted and alienated you will find yourself filled with contempt either real or imagine soon enough you have seen too much you know the wrong things experience is a well dressed curse the higher power has a price the price is the silence of truth the ghosts never leave the echoes never die down they know you better than anyone ever will until you stop fighting the reality of your life you will pass the nights looking for someone else to share your isolation with you will never meet your equal because you have none you will only be reminded of your discontent hence your emptiness and contempt while in the intimate company of another you are uniquely damaged its the scars that keep you from ever getting away from what you know what you are the sooner you learn to accept your fate the better the time passes easier you stop tormenting yourself i know how it is sometimes trust me theres no one who understands except other people like us ones who are damned and know it in my company there is no solace because all we have in common is the abyss which fate has cast us to walk forever through you always walk through it alone this is lifes sickness this is the joke life plays on us look too deeply and regret forever i know you know all this shit im dragging this motherfucker all the way down the drain fuck it
2875678 avoid those areas of north cotabato province where military operations are ongoing and to exercise extreme caution in central mindanao

2875683 the main rules have not changed since the beginning of the competition 10 years ago we have six men or women sitting inside the sauna on each round and the winner is the last one to leave
2875684 there are no world records we cannot control all the factors like the temperature of the sauna or the water thrown into the stove
2875685 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2875686 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2875687 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity

2875690 if those russian ships leave that port in the black sea and if ukraine decides that it is not going to allow those ships back into that port that is a potentially much greater conflagration involving a wider regional area
2875691 right now our focus is on working with both sides with the europeans and with a whole variety of international institutions and organizations to get the fighting to stop
2875692 it is ridiculous to ask us to do this because georgia will never use force against its own people as simple as that
2875693 tpa has been demonstrated to reduce disability from ischemic clot caused stroke however the drug is only currently approved for use within three hours of symptom onset
2875694 it is important for people to recognize the symptoms of stroke and promptly call 9 1 1 emergency medical services when they occur
2875695 although patients arriving at the hospital within two hours of symptom onset were significantly more likely to receive a timely ct scan than those who did not 24 percent vs 9 percent most 76 percent did not
2875696 this points to areas where stroke systems of care can be improved in hospitals improvements could increase patients access to time dependent therapies and potentially reduce disability from stroke
2875697 this may be the first time a physical signature for a personality disorder has been identified
2875698 for the first time to my knowledge we have a specific brain association for people with a personality disorder
2875699 its new and different because its not a lesion or injury to the brain but it is a difference in perceiving information that comes from an interaction
2875700 its not just a matter of bad attitudes or a lack of will

2875707 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia

2875724 people think a soul mate is your perfect fit and thats what everyone wants but a true soul mate is a mirror the person who shows you everything that is holding you back the person who brings you to your own attention so you can change your life a true soul mate is probably the most important person youll ever meet because they tear down your walls and smack you awake but to live with a soul mate forever nah too painful soul mates they come into your life just to reveal another layer of yourself to you and then leave a soul mates purpose is to shake you up tear apart your ego a little bit show you your obstacles and addictions break your heart open so new light can get in make you so desperate and out of control that you have to transform your life then introduce you to your spiritual master

2875730 i left the woods for as good a reason as i went there perhaps it seemed to me that i had several more lives to live and could not spare any more time for that one it is remarkable how easily and insensibly we fall into a particular route and make a beaten track for ourselves

2875737 shared in the work that was to be done timothy didnt watch it take place he took part in it
2875738 some believe that affliction means god is angry at the believer the truth is that affliction means that god loves us enough to give the best when we may only desire what is easy the symbol of christianity is the cross not a feather bed affliction is just part of following jesus therefore paul recognized that christians are appointed to affliction
2875739 why on earth would i ever follow jesus who wants to be persecuted
2875740 remember that the church had eventually become an example to the whole region of the gospel of christ some of the most prominent ways that was evident was through their faith trust in the truth of god amp love outworking of the grace of god 7 therefore brethren in all our affliction and distress we were comforted concerning you by your faith 8 for now we live if you stand fast in the lord in the midst of his trials all paul wanted to know was whether or not the church was standing fast in christ and when he found out he was comforted thats not only reflective of the heart of a pastor thats truly good news for any church fellowship in the body of christ so many people leave the grace of christ to chase after legalistic trips or they leave the sufficiency of christ to chase after magical signs or the leave the truth of christ to chase after the philosophy of man we need simply to stand fast in the lord 9 for what thanks can we render to god for you for all the joy with which we rejoice for your sake before our god 10 night and day praying exceedingly that we may see your face and perfect what is lacking in your faith they thanked god for the church they rejoiced before god for the church they prayed abundantly for the church amen what a terrific response to a good report coming back from timothy they could thank god for what he was doing in the lives of the believers as he strengthened them amp matured them in christ they could rejoice in praise for their faith they would pray that god would continue to help them grow wait a minute if paul was thanking god for their faith why would he pray for something that was lacking in it answer a question with a question do we ever want to who would want that theres always more to learn of his truth theres always more experience of his grace how did they pray 1 consistently night amp day whenever they thought of the church 2 fervently exceedingly superabundantly with passion amp intensity 3 eagerly to see them face to face again 4 sufficiently that they would be matured amp made complete in christ great model for intercession among the church gives an example of their daily prayers here as he launches into one 11 now may our god and father himself and our lord jesus christ direct our way to you the request is simply that paul might see them again but he bathes it in theology our god and father when we are born again by the spirit of god we are all brought into the same family of god there may be all kinds of different church congregations and fellowships but there is only one church he is both god and father he is the almighty creator god for whom the universe fits within the palm of his hand he is everlasting and is perfectly righteous holy and just because he is god at the same time because of christ jesus he is our loving abba father who invites us to come boldly before his throne of grace in our times of need our lord jesus christ by linking him with god the father paul is affirming that christ is god the son both are equally powerful and equally authoritative both the father and lord jesus are the one able to actually direct paul back to thessalonica why is all this important we need to understand who it is that we pray to we dont raise our hands to the hindu god vishnu we dont make requests to the islamic idea of allah we pray to the one true god fully revealed in the lord jesus christ 12 and may the lord make you increase and abound in love to one another and to all just as we increase and abound in love the idea with both words is that their agape love would be superabundant both in quantity and quality there are a lot of doctrines we hold dear that can sometimes cause division in the church when we put too much emphasis on them but if theres one thing a christian is not going to be able to overdo it in its in loving one another great commandment matthew 22 38 39 3 this is the first and great commandment 39 and the second is like it you shall love your neighbor as yourself new commandment john 13 34 35 34 a new commandment i give to you that you love one another as i have loved you that you also love one another 35 by this all will know that you are my disciples if you have love for one another

2875753 the biggest thing were working through and certainly the thing thats gotten the most attention
2875754 as of yesterday weve had over 22 000 applications and the vast majority of those have been approved so we are where we thought we would be
2875755 frankly we can save those individuals not eligible for travel from getting on a plane and arriving in the u s and finding out later that they are not eligible for entry and being turned away
2875756 we have made tremendous strides particularly in the past two years in the quality of that data
2875757 the airlines have voiced their concerns about that and we will continue to work with them on it we have gone back to the airlines particularly on the economic data because they said there was a significant cost associated with this that we had not accounted for
2875758 this is not a security priority for the department as we look at all of the things that were looking at across the board
2875759 we do realize that the integrity of the immigration system is important
2875760 im very excited about seeing it implemented before we leave because its been a very long road
2875761 we have seen frankly from both u s citizens and canadian citizens just tremendous compliance with this
2875762 we havent as a public posture moved to some sort of hard enforcement
2875763 this is completely unacceptable especially from lips of a representative of a country whose actions we are aware of in iraq afghanistan and serbia
2875764 an immediate ceasefire and withdrawal of all forces to the status quo
2875765 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2875766 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2875767 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2875768 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2875769 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2875770 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2875771 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2875772 provisions on the rules of jihad short judicial rulings and organisational instructions for fighters and mujahideen against infidels

2875774 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2875775 dude your metanarratives dont do it for me i dont need somebody doing their power trip on me telling me whats right and wrong

2875811 more will be added as the colored population becomes informed of the school for their children
2875812 it was pointed out to the colored parents that it would be best for them to patronize the separate school as their children would not run the risk of humiliating treatment at the hands of white pupils and that the school maintained for the negroes was of a high standard but all of these arguments failed to impress the colored parents
2875813 the lease on the school room in w front st expires this fall and the school board decided the best way out of the situation was to abandon the school

2875884 as people of jammu have decided to continue the economic blockade the government must open alternative trade routes to tackle the grave situation in the valley india and pakistan must immediately open the cross loc routes with valley
2875885 it is surprising how the government is tolerating the economic blockade to kashmir the blockade is totally unconstitutional illegal and government must immediately act against the vested interests and restore supplies to the valley
2875886 the authorities should also explore alternative road links to the valley
2875887 many of our bookings have been cancelled as the activists of extremists organizations are not allowing the tourists to travel to kashmir we desperately need to explore the options of alternative route links like jehlum valley road in the wake of the blockade
2875888 the opening of routes like srinagar muzaffarabad will not only give kashmiri products an access to the international markets like central and east asia but other world class products could also be made available to the consumers here
2875889 the cross loc trade will give fillip to the valleys economy

2875925 mere diplomacy alone wont split iran from syria i dont see the upside to talks that will grant the baath party led by syrian president bashar assad longevity and legitimacy
2875926 it is always hard for a weak besieged government to take dramatic action when you have the kind of upheaval in the government as you do in israel today it is always to the advantage of your adversaries
2875927 just because israel is dancing with assad this opened the doors to him in europe

2875941 i was very comfortable with my game there very happy about what i was doing
2875942 here it wasnt the case i wasnt happy with how i was swinging the golf club this week in terms of my focus or maybe dehydration or tiredness but something had me a little bit off my stride this week my coordination wasnt quite there
2875943 so as long as i could hang in there i knew that i would get my opportunity and if it was going to be my day i would take that opportunity
2875944 its a fascinating thing that i really didnt have my golf swing this week
2875945 my coordination was out on thursday i couldnt get to the clubhouse fast enough

2875956 harvey had 17 possessions to half time with two blokes rotating on him so you put a bloke who is not getting the ball on a player who is and it worked out pretty well
2875957 i thought he played pretty well in the second half
2875958 if he had continued on with what happened in the first half he may have been in the frame with a few other players he might have been considered
2875959 he needs to go back and show his teammates because you cant carry someone whose body language is the way it is today
2875960 his second efforts are non existent when you turn up and show you dont want to be out there you have a spell
2875961 i havent got deep seated concerns every week even the ones we lost we have played some good football

2876042 no knowledge or understanding of file trading online distribution networks or copyright infringement
2876043 defendant had no reason to doubt that her actions were 100 free and 100 legal and that she believed programs like kazaa to be similar to online radio stations
2876044 although proper notice was provided on the cover of each of the recordings a question remains as to whether defendant knew the warnings on compact discs were applicable in this kazaa setting
2876045 in this case there were no compact discs with warnings
2876046 plaintiffs have not introduced any evidence to contradict that defendant did not have an understanding of the nature of file sharing programs and copyright sophisticated enough to have reason to know that her actions infringed plaintiffs copyrights therefore the court finds that a fact issue exists as to whether defendant was an innocent infringer

2876051 and geelong and to a lesser extent hawthorn are just completely stifling betting at the top end
2876052 given they have to play at least three finals you cant have the cats much shorter than 1 55
2876053 but if they were to jump next saturday for the ultimate prize they would be as short as essendon was in 2000
2876054 its really hard to see how they are going to get beaten unless buddy franklin has one of those days out and kicks straight
2876055 the marketing alliance with chs inc is an important one for graincorp and the australian durum industry
2876056 graincorp brings the strength of our wheat desk our up country grain accumulation and storage expertise our road and rail logistics and port infrastructure to this alliance
2876057 chs inc bring their expertise as a leading durum marketer and processor and the strong relationships they have with the worlds leading durum processors
2876058 for the first time in the history of the durum industry in australia we will be able to leverage a strategic relationship with a truly global marketer not just sell into a limited number of markets
2876059 combined with increasing capital expenditure requirements ongoing regulatory scrutiny and a softening domestic economy the company remains weakly positioned within its rating
2876060 i have really focused hard on the majors the last two years
2876061 i have turned up to other events and unless i get into contention it feels like a race or a sprint
2876062 where as a major feels like a marathon i feel like i can be patient and take my time i love the feeling of knowing that it is going to come down to the back nine and who can do it under pressure on the last nine holes
2876063 i am a great believer in making it your own responsibility whether you win or dont win i knew i was playing catch up and those are the moments that change tournaments when you take shots on and they come off and you have to do it on the back nine you are not going to win any other way
2876064 i had a discussion with my trainer back home and it was possible i was dehydrated
2876065 so that gave me something to focus on i focused on re hydrating myself whether that was the cause or not i dont know it might have just been tiredness
2876066 but at least i had something tangible that i could pin it on and try to put effort into it and it gave me the belief that if i get my hydration right my co ordination would come back
2876067 i have probably been the leading golfer in europe for close to six years
2876068 it is a big step to move up and start competing on a different level ive got tiger woods and ive got phil mickelson ahead of me
2876069 it is a long way to catch tiger at the top but i know that the only way of focusing on doing that is to focus on controlling what i can do i cant control tiger or phil i am going to continue to strive to improve
2876070 i love the idea of a back nine of a major on sunday so much that i am actually disappointed i am seven months away from the next major
2876071 based on the statements by family members that mr hayes had been treated of late for a number of medical issues we believe that led to his death today there are no plans for an autopsy
2876072 when i finished the house was on its feet man and i was a hit so i started pursuing music big time

2876080 last year kevin 07 was everywhere dripping with empathy draping himself across petrol station forecourts shopping centre aisles promising to stop prices going up
2876081 i dont think its worth me getting what i would call premature stress over something that may not occur
2876082 but that doesnt mean im not going to give it serious thought in the meantime
2876083 it is expected that approximately 500 absent votes from each division will be counted at his time
2876084 were finding clear evidence that working on country has benefits for the health of aboriginal people and for the nation
2876085 the health benefits in terms of reducing levels of high blood pressure diabetes and kidney disease are quite striking when people are actively engaged in looking after their country
2876086 aboriginal elders and leaders set up these small settlements because it was important to their wellbeing and health
2876087 if you move people away from their land in an attempt to deliver better health and other services paradoxically you may sever the link that gives them both physical and psychological health
2876088 the health impacts derive partly from improved diet and fitness but are also due to the psychological and social effects of caring for country she explains
2876089 but they also mean people live longer lives in which they can contribute to their society grandparents for example can look after the kids longer or people can work for longer and generate more economic activity

2876098 its always pretty fun when you walk the dodgers off the field
2876099 theyve done it to us a lot in the past they did it to us in 04 to knock us out of the playoffs it was kind of good to give it back to them
2876100 this was a big series for us to keep our confidence going obviously for those guys in contention if theyre going to do it theyre going to have to go through us were going to have to push them
2876101 if he could do that i was pretty confident i could get to second and theres always a good chance hell beat it out
2876102 early in the season our pitching kept us in games and we found ways to win but right now were not playing well and were not swinging the bats great we have maybe one key at bat per game one at bat to do something and we havent capitalized on it
2876103 its great we got off to a good start and played that well but unfortunately it created some unrealistic expectations outside the organization
2876104 that said theres no reason we cant bounce back the next seven weeks and play the way we did in the first half
2876105 truthfully the results are nasty but i feel like i made some very good improvements today with my stuff
2876106 im going to keep fighting obviously i have to start getting outs and put up zeros you can talk all day about feeling better
2876107 i know ive been in the league 23 months and the first 22 were pretty solid the last month was the first time ive experienced prolonged poor results and it will turn around im probably not going to see late innings when weve got a guy whos thrown 37 scoreless innings i understand that at the same time i expect that within a month from now sept 10 i will have righted my ship
2876108 more than anything its coincidence we played really really well the early part of the season and we expected to be a lot better than this
2876109 obviously the biggest thing is the offense we havent swung the bats well its been really bad its not fun at all
2876110 we played them two years ago and we won something like 21 to 2 or 3 theyve come a long way since then

2876119 friedman takes a fresh and provocative look at two of the biggest challenges we face today americas surprising loss of focus and national purpose since 9 11 and the global environmental crisis which is affecting everything from food to fuel to forests in this groundbreaking account of where we stand now he shows us how the solutions to these two big problems are linked how we can restore the world and revive america at the same time
2876120 friedman makes it clear that the green revolution we need is like no revolution the world has seen it will be the biggest innovation project in american history it will be hard not easy and it will change everything from what you put into your car to what you see on your electric bill but the payoff for america will be more than just cleaner air it will inspire americans to something we havent seen in a long time nation building in america by summoning the intelligence creativity boldness and concern for the common good that are our nations greatest natural resources
2876121 the former democratic vice presidential nominee who has endorsed john mccain is being vetted as a potential running mate for the republican presidential hopeful
2876122 mr lieberman who has campaigned for the arizona senator has long been considered an unconventional but plausible choice for mr mccain
2876123 theres no question that john mccain has made a major change in his media strategy the candidate that once spent hours cracking jokes with reporters now significantly limits access for the national press corps
2876124 the presumptive republican nominee spent a total of 38 minutes talking to print television magazine and radio reporters from national publications over the past week according to the count on my recorder
2876125 deciding when you pick a vice president shapes whom you pick by waiting until the eve of their conventions both obama and mccain will face nearly irresistible pressures to pick nominees who are safe secure and a trifle soporific there is nothing like the onset of a convention to create a groundswell for a conventional vice president

2876140 cpi inflation is expected to be higher in the short term at around 5 per cent in the december quarter reflecting the effects of higher petrol prices and the recent correction to estimates of financial services inflation before declining thereafter
2876141 a move in november is a likelihood rather than september
2876142 theres still a fair bit of talk of elevated inflation and that suggests theyll wait for the next cpi before they move
2876143 the way this statement reads its just a little bit of hosing down how excited the market was getting for a 50 basis point rate cut
2876144 when they do start to cut its more likely to be a smaller cut rather than big cuts
2876145 the reserve banks been pretty clear and lucid in terms of slowing growth and is signalling rate cuts are not too far off
2876146 we certainly think well get one in the next few months and certainly by early next year
2876147 were actually saying november or just within the next three months and certainly one will be in by february

2876163 it was just a tremendous explosion and blew all the windows out of the house just blew the house up and i just managed to get out of there in time
2876164 at present we do not know anything about how the explosions occurred and we are waiting to learn about its cause
2876165 everyone was just running down the street it was like something from a movie
2876166 we got freaked out my family woke up they thought it was a plane that went down
2876167 there was a very very large amount of fire when we arrived and the extent of the explosion if the blast was heard as far away as it was could have been much more serious

2876189 weve been shooting together for a long time we are really friends and dont get mixed up in political things sports is not politics
2876190 is consistent with the moderation in economic growth seen in the second quarter
2876191 gdp growth in the second half is likely to be broadly similar to the first half
2876192 weaker demand in the major economies coupled with the need to contain inflationary pressures will dampen growth in the fast growing asian economies
2876193 the lower growth in the second quarter was mainly the result of a sharp contraction in biomedical manufacturing value added
2876194 stagnant growth in the electronics industry also contributed to the slowdown in gdp growth
2876195 i tried to find my mom but i couldnt find her
2876196 if the world were to draw any lessons from what i did there would never be any wars
2876197 this is a true testament to the importance you place on relations with china
2876198 the drug issue from azerbaijan in the qualifying tournament was quite complicated and as you know for two months our team was quite perturbed by this issue
2876199 there were even discussions in the team whether it was wise for us to come to the beijing olympic games or not
2876200 i personally had a role in calming down the emotions of the team members

2876202 we have prepared really well beforehand we had all kinds of simulations in training including those designed to help us deal with distraction and concentrate on the match
2876203 my team members were a little nervous and some players lost the opportunity to score
2876204 therefore we have to resolve the problem in the shooting circle so that we convert opportunities
2876205 the main issue is how to make the best of the opportunities within the shooting circle many of them got the opportunity we also have to make sure that the senior players are kept fresh
2876206 the secretary general is alarmed by the escalation of hostilities in georgia which have resulted in large numbers of casualties and massive destruction in south ossetia and other regions of georgia
2876207 profoundly concerned over mounting tensions in the abkhaz zone including the bombing of the upper kodori valley
2876208 this is a conflict that is expanding and getting out of control
2876209 the proximate cause is the massive escalation perpetrated by outside forces
2876210 the georgians have made an offer of a cease fire and its concerning that the russians wont respond to that
2876211 its clear that the russians are looking to prolong the conflict in some way because they will give no assurances either about a cessation of hostilities or about withdrawing their forces
2876212 it is where i was born my parents live there and i go back as often as i can and i will never not represent zimbabwe as long as im swimming

2876225 saya akan betul betul senang kalau berbatov tetap di klub ini setelah bursa transfer ditutup dan saya sungguh mengharapkan itu dia pemain yang bagus sekali dan kami ingin menikmati musim bagus darinya lagi di klub ini
2876226 wajar saja kalau laga terakhir lawan kamerun menjadi penting untuk bisa menjaga tempat teratas grup sekaligus menghindari brasil
2876227 meski begitu dengan mempertimbangkan penampilan kami saya yakin brasil juga takkan terlalu senang kalau sudah harus menghadapi kami di fase fase awal
2876228 surveys indicate that three quarters of all reported front end collisions occur at speeds below 30km h and in 50 per cent of those cases the driver doesnt brake at all front end collisions often occur at roundabouts intersections and car parks they can result in vehicle occupant injury as well as seemingly minor but expensive to repair front end damage

2876231 ive apologised and weve had a good discussion about that its a very unfortunate set of circumstances
2876232 i just go for it with the feeling that i am going to have fun doing the activities
2876233 the formulation and execution of a plan by michael clark to murder his own father through the instrument of his son in cold blood obviously places this crime on the more serious end of the scale

2876291 pada hemat saya pas sebagai sebuah gerakan islam tidak boleh membenarkan kerajaan yang menghakis kuasa politik orang islam dibentuk dalam negara kita membenarkannya juga membawa erti kita telah melanggar dan bersalahan dengan semangat perlembagaan parti yang kita tubuh dan perjuangkan selama ini iaitu ke arah membentuk kerajaan yang terlaksana di dalamnya al amru bil makruf dan an nahyu anil mungkar pula menurut lunas syariat
2876292 dan janganlah kamu merasa lemah dalam perjuangan mempertahan dan menegakkan islam dan janganlah kamu berdukacita terhadap apa yang akan menimpa kamu padahal kamulah orang orang yang tertinggi mengatasi musuh dengan mencapai kemenangan jika kamu orang orang yang sungguh sungguh beriman
2876293 i think i was willing them into the hole at that stage
2876294 you have to get focused and give it a go
2876295 but i guess thats the way things go sometimes the only thing i can do is go back home with my head up high and keep working on it
2876296 lets try to keep this as positive as we can please
2876297 i turned to my caddie on 16 and said god this is a lot of fun just to watch
2876298 the whole issue was created by separatist leaders who would like to stop the hindu pilgrimage the real motive is a complete islamisation of the valley after having successfully forced kashmiri hindus to leave the valley
2876299 this is not a struggle merely for 100 acres of land this is the struggle for the identity of our motherland
2876300 it will be an unimpeachable document supported by documentary evidence of all the acts of omission and commission committed by president musharraf that make him liable to impeachment several times
2876301 we are in the government now and have access to many previously confidential documents after going through these documents we are surprised over the horrendous nature of the crimes committed by president musharraf during his almost nine year rule
2876302 the man will have to go it is a political reality and impeachment is just a legal and constitutional procedure to realise it
2876303 if the charge sheet is put into river ravi it will come into flood as far as gross irregularities and constitutional violations are concerned
2876304 the revelation if true lends enormous credence to what was generally talked about in the streets of pakistan about the likely killers of ms bhutto it also lends dramatic significance to the last email she had sent to her lobbyist in the us pointing out dangers to her life and indicating also who she suspected could be involved if something happened to her
2876305 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia
2876306 here we are trying to promote peace and harmony and were witnessing a conflict take place

2876309 barack obama is about to make one of the most important decisions of this campaign choosing a running mate
2876310 he hadnt been chief minister very long and that in itself was a difficulty because his record in office was quite short
2876311 a lot of people were probably quite upset by the timing of the election they werent convinced by the reason the chief minister gave
2876312 its not their gig they like to be friendly with all the parties because they cant pick and chose whose going to be in national power
2876313 i think they would run a mile rather than get caught up in some local political shindig
2876314 we deliberately didnt touch on that out of respect for the moment and just acknowledged each others path and what happened on the weekend as member for nelson and member for blain
2876315 it was absolutely amazing within several days after that email being circulated a number of people came to our door and said we heard youre strapped for cash heres our cheque
2876316 their record on education and education is one of the big issues has been appalling through their whole government and basically the chicken has come home to roost
2876317 this swing againt labour would not have been so great if the party had kept clair martin as their leaded for this election
2876318 its obvious that the public has quickly become disenchanted with rudd and the labor brand and the coalition must capitalise on that now
2876319 the military institution says it is ok to kill and use the most horrible weapons and that killing the enemy is heroic
2876320 i respect dick for having humanity over his military obligations
2876321 the regular people and the government wanted to surrender but the military people didnt want to surrender
2876322 i believe it is the stubbornness of the military people that caused the bombing of japan

2876326 wir wissen von anfragen der medienindustrie bei providern nach bestimmten daten f r ihre eigenen zwecke die datenauslieferung wird unserer kenntnis nach aber verweigert
2876327 es w re nicht rechtskonform in deutschland l sst das bundesdatenschutzgesetz die herausgabe individueller nutzerprofile an dritte nicht zu
2876328 dabei muss aber gew hrleistet sein dass der nutzer in allgemein verst ndlicher form dar ber unterrichtet wird und diese auswertung auch untersagen kann
2876329 wenn angeh rige eines verstorbenen allerdings darauf bestehen dass das profil eines familienmitglieds gel scht werden soll respektieren wir diesen wunsch
2876330 zuallererst bermitteln wir in solchen f llen den angeh rigen unsere anteilnahme dann schlie en wir den betreffenden account sodass es f r andere community mitglieder nicht l nger sichtbar ist
2876331 bei rund zehn mio mitgliedern lassen sich f lle von l ngere zeit inaktiven nutzerprofilen nicht vermeiden

2876333 aufgrund des gro en wachstums das der online bereich immer noch verzeichnet gibt es aus wirtschaftlicher sicht auch heute noch viele m glichkeiten f r internet start ups erfolgreich zu sein
2876334 meiner meinung nach ist es generell sehr schwierig den wirtschaftlichen erfolg im it bereich abzusch tzen
2876335 facebook hat viel geld von investorenseite bekommen aus meiner sicht ist das start up aber derzeit noch weit weg von einem wirtschaftlichen erfolg
2876336 bestes beispiel hierf r ist wikipedia das sicherlich nicht als wirtschaftlicher erfolg zu bezeichnen ist aber dennoch ein sehr gutes projekt darstellt
2876337 die betreiber von bittorrent haben es bislang nicht geschafft ein geeignetes gesch ftsmodell vorzulegen das die basis f r eine erfolgreiche wirtschaftliche entwicklung des projekts darstellen k nnte
2876338 das land muss hier zentral hilfestellung geben damit bergreifende vernetzungen stattfinden k nnen
2876339 die charakteristischen regionen hessens sollten als reise destinationen st rker hervorgehoben werden weil sie eigene identit ten haben unter denen sie bekannt sind das ist sinnvoller als sie unter abstrakten begriffen wie nordhessen zusammenzufassen unter denen sich potenzielle besucher viel weniger vorstellen k nnen
2876340 es war emaa midde im winder wo die schneeflogge wie feddern vom himmel erunner sinn da hat e keenischin an em fensder gesess un geneht
2876341 die studie hat zumindest vom ansatz her recht die filmindustrie hat derzeit mit wirtschaftlich schlechten zeiten zu k mpfen
2876342 seit vergangener woche sind die entsprechenden werte f r besucherzahlen und ums tze in deutschland aber wieder ins minus gerutscht
2876343 vor allem das kinogesch ft ist aber ein l ngerfristiges eine generelle wirtschaftliche tendenz l sst sich deshalb pauschal nur sehr schwer feststellen
2876344 seit einigen jahren hat sich das grundlegend ge ndert mein eindruck ist dass die filmwirtschaft heute wesentlich st rker von wirtschaftsflauten betroffen ist als fr her
2876345 der siegeszug des internets und das damit einhergehende problem der piraterie stellen ein zunehmendes problem f r die filmindustrie dar
2876346 jeden auch noch so gut versteckten web content ausfindig machen k nnten der etwas taugt
2876347 aufgrund der rasant zunehmenden menge an inhalten von blogs nachrichtenportalen bild und video archiven privaten webseiten und dergleichen wird eine effektive suchm glichkeit f r die user immer mehr von bedeutung um an die informationen zu kommen die sie suchen
2876348 e mail dienste geh ren seit mehr als zehn jahren zur grundausstattung des internets und sind f r mio nutzer einer der wichtigsten einstiegspunkte in die digitale welt
2876349 die suche nach bestimmten inhalten spielt in anbetracht der informationsflut im netz eine immer gr ere rolle zugleich haben suchmaschinen ihre suchergebnisse immer weiter optimiert und benutzerfreundlich ausgebaut
2876350 die ergebnisse sind erfreulich da sie zeigen dass radio weiterhin ein fester bestandteil der mediennutzung ist
2876351 gerade jugendliche setzen auf eine vielzahl an medien aus denen sie sich informieren und unterhalten lassen
2876352 das war zu erwarten denn im gegensatz zu radio oder fernsehen hatte internet bisher keine 100 prozentige abdeckung deshalb ist dort noch wachstumspotenzial
2876353 die jugend ist computeraffin und konsumiert viele inhalte ber das internet
2876354 all diesen entwicklungen sind wir uns bewusst von daher bieten wir unseren kunden seit l ngerem auch cross mediale pakete an wo sie neben radiowerbung auch gleich werbefl chen im netz buchen k nnen
2876355 mit zunehmendem alter ver ndert sich aufgrund neuer lebensverh ltnisse auch der medienkonsum
2876356 das internet ist ganz sicher wie jedes andere ein konkurrenzmedium zum radio doch macht radio mehr aus als das abspielen von musiktiteln und kurze moderatorische zwischensequenzen
2876357 wer unterhaltung information bildung und musik zusammen haben will der wird auf das klassische radio setzen
2876358 mom can you teach me long division today i still dont understand it and i dont want to go back to school in two weeks not knowing it

2876393 mongolia like kazakhstan is a country that is rich in mineral assets
2876394 we have agreed to exchange experience in the development of deposits by kazakhstani investors we have specialists who can do this
2876395 the west has withdrawn from the fight for mongolian assets and russia and china are becoming the main rivals
2876396 this means that after the election results are summed up a serious struggle could begin in the mprp between the pro russian and pro chinese groups
2876397 we are not satisfied with the current state of trade between kazakhstan and mongolia
2876398 the development of trade relations is hampered by the absence of a proper road we want to build a road from kazakhstan to mongolia through russian territory
2876399 plays an important role in the development of good neighborly relations and cooperation between countries of the region

2876416 the previous site dealt mainly with international audience and was not structured to cater for the local community
2876417 it was also rather unwieldy and some information awkward to access the new site is simplified and contains much more information and updated news about the firm our offices different services events our resources and capabilities while still possessing capabilities for interested visitors to drill down and gain access to our other primary regional intelligence websites
2876418 we want to keep pushing as many as we possibly can

2876422 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict
2876423 now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected
2876424 t he news reports indicate that russian military forces crossed an internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of georgia russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory

2876451 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2876452 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2876453 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2876454 cerrado por vacaciones del 9 al 26 de agosto o 27 o cuando sea que vuelva
2876455 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2876456 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2876457 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2876458 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2876459 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2876465 israel is seeking to play down its defense exports to georgia which is battling russia in a border war
2876466 israel plans to halt military equipment sales to georgia because of objections from russia haaretz reported aug 5 citing unnamed israeli defense officials
2876467 the fighting which broke out over the weekend between russia and georgia has brought israels intensive involvement in the region into the limelight this involvement includes the sale of advanced weapons to georgia and the training of the georgian armys infantry forces
2876468 the former georgian ambassador to israel estimates that israeli real estate defense and other investment in georgia exceeds 1 billion and that the russia georgia war is putting these investments at risk
2876469 jewish georgian minister temur yakobshvili on sunday praised the israel defense forces for its role in training georgian troops and said israel should be proud of its military might in an interview with army radio
2876470 israel should be proud of its military which trained georgian soldiers
2876471 rubber bullets were fired indiscriminately and also directly at fleeing demonstrators heavily armed police and security personnel stormed a private television station imedi threatening and ejecting the staff as well as damaging and destroying much of the stations equipment forcing the station off the air while the georgian government claimed that it was responding to threats of massive public disorder and a coup detat it has not provided evidence to support these allegations moreover such allegations cannot justify the level of force used
2876472 there is clearly a significant demand for affordable housing in kenner as evidenced by the long line of people who showed up to apply for affordable housing and it concerns me that the government hasnt recognized that need
2876473 would be willing to consider the affordable housing needs of its citizens
2876474 we have an abundance of multifamily housing in kenner and we have a responsibility to study the impacts of development on drainage sewerage and other infrastructure matters before we build more
2876475 i think when you buy a home you dont want to see those buildings around it is what it is call it prejudice or whatever but its pretty much the opinion of everyone you talk to
2876476 there is a shortage of affordable rental housing in the region and to ban new construction will only worsen that
2876477 mixed use developments are popular around the country and are now beginning to pop up around louisiana
2876478 you hear people say we dont want any multifamily because there is a perception that the buildings automatically translate to section 8 tenants crime or other problems
2876479 but a lot of the time it is not multifamily housing that is per se the issue it is landlords that arent properly maintaining developments or some tenants that arent doing what they should be doing
2876480 i see a demand in south kenner for higher end rentals for young professionals who dont want to live in new orleans and arent ready to buy a home
2876481 to see just a portion of these incredible projects realized in the next 10 years would be amazing
2876482 materials are expressed within the design and pervading everything is a sense of sustainability and environmental consideration
2876483 we want the riverfront to tell our story to reflect this authentic place
2876484 the idea was to develop a space where people could connect with the city and feel the presence the river at any point in the 6 mile swath
2876485 the rebuild center was expected to be needed another five years
2876486 but with the way new orleans is coming around it could be much longer
2876487 there are modern buildings in lakeview on canal street and elsewhere in the city that are under the gun and those buildings though currently unprotected are as valuable as the double shotguns and victorian mansions that we treasure
2876488 we are a city of architectural diversity and people love that diversity and sense that as new orleans
2876489 what is being designed now is a contemporary design for the city as it is now and there is room for a new interpretation of new orleans
2876490 the first time we saw the house we were moving into another apartment down the street
2876491 said mitchell whose third floor bedroom is connected via a sliding glass door to a balcony overlooking the river
2876492 it was rented then but we kept looking at it the second we saw it come up for rent on craigs list we called we knew it was special and we knew we were going to live there
2876493 the idb is the premier tool for redevelopment in the city
2876494 he has been a good president and now he is ready to move on
2876495 i am looking for someone who will fit in with the board and can bring a similar wealth of community experience and knowledge to the table
2876496 without the idb our projects would never have moved forward
2876497 one of the challenges that thorns dealt with is that everything getting built following katrina requires cocktails of subsidies that have never before been used
2876498 long before hurricane katrina new orleans suffered from having too much property off the tax rolls the result was crumbling infrastructure reduced services and higher tax rates for property owners paying taxes
2876499 we noticed that there is more or less an ad hoc process without standards policies and procedures which creates the risk that an entity is approving unnecessary tax breaks and thereby wasting taxpayer money
2876500 they say we will approve everything and anything that is not true but the end game is that we got 1 8 billion in federal bonds for the city and have gotten the ball rolling on the citys redevelopment while others were doing expensive studies
2876501 what we do is more than giving up tax breaks or bonds its building a labor base new jobs and in other sources of revenue we are stimulating activity and creating ripples of growth
2876502 if there are other communities that are competing with us who are willing to give these tax breaks and we are not then we are at a disadvantage
2876503 its a competitive world and to attract development you have to use whatever tools are in your tool box as long as the benefits outweigh the costs
2876504 the idb is a board of volunteers making decisions about fairly significant amounts of money with limited expertise and resources

2876507 rene roch president of the international fencing federation beamed like a particularly distinguished cheshire cat
2876508 you make a name to describe a section of the city and suddenly people begin to relate to it as a place
2876509 you give a name and people can say i am from there and feel proud of that place people begin to treat the streets differently
2876510 there was all this neglect but there was also a school and a playground and trees and churches
2876511 all the amenities for a great neighborhood were there but none of the investment
2876512 ms louis never came back and the man in the yellow house drowned in the storm
2876513 i heard about this hoffman triangle and then came out here saw the houses and the school and knew it was a place that was going to come back strong
2876514 i wouldnt tell my daughter to invest anywhere i didnt think was coming back
2876515 the objective is to revitalize the neighborhood so we are going to identify as many properties as we can for expropriation
2876516 the people most in need which are those who cant afford to buy a single family home are the people being discriminated against
2876517 requires property owners who wish to rent or lease or lease to own their property undergo an intimidating irrational oppressive and indefensible process
2876518 the power people gave me running water but they wont give me lights because they say the parish wont give them permission now there is a notice of condemnation on the house
2876519 really and truly i dont feel comfortable there but i need somewhere to live
2876520 its criteria was so unreasonable and there were no assurances that we would even get the permits
2876521 it was an unreasonable amount to ask of an investor who has already put his life savings into building houses for people who needed places to live
2876522 my tenants are receiving eviction notices they are working people with families who are getting notices that they are being evicted how can i give them refunds when i am almost out of money
2876523 our critical task is trying to stabilize real estate values and the neighborhoods for the people who own property here
2876524 if you can meet the four criteria for the permit there is no reason to deny it
2876525 i feel embarrassed because i am the only person in the neighborhood with a sign on the lawn the only person who has to deal with inspectors coming in and making us feel like we shouldnt be here
2876526 in modern hotels and ballrooms they have windows with views of the city we want to compete with these venues
2876527 the superdome is kind of inhuman light will humanize it i am fairly certain that buster curtis would approve he was a smart architect and any smart architect would be in support of natural light
2876528 if they give a view of downtown i would not be opposed
2876529 its hard to add a hole and hide it too but that is what we are trying to do
2876530 we loved the idea of punching open the skin of this building that for so long has been monolithic over the city
2876531 we wanted to connect this icon of the city to its streets the windows do that
2876532 the introduction of windows at that time would have distracted somewhat from the effectiveness of the original multipurpose program
2876533 our water coolers have an in built ambient temperature sensor ats
2876534 our water coolers have an ats which saves 50 on energy consumption
2876535 our water coolers are the only ones to have an ats which saves 50 on energy consumption meaning an average saving of 200 per annum per cooler
2876536 lets get nick jonass 16th bithday on super sweet sixteen
2876537 my grandparents live there and theyre very excited to be seeing me again ive been in touch with a couple of families in the town who are keen to host me while im there
2876538 that means ill have to sit exams in german and maori language later in the year in cologne which should be interesting
2876539 its great for language learners because they dont have to be fluent speakers
2876540 anna will get work experience through teaching at the school but more importantly will gain cultural exposure while in germany it will provide opportunities should she wish to go back and work there after finishing her studies
2876541 we communicated that message beforehand to the russians through u s secretary of state condoleezza rice
2876542 we must check all that we dont trust the georgian side
2876543 we heard a plane go over and then a big explosion
2876544 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2876545 the deployment is quite natural we dont want a repeat of what happened in south ossetia
2876546 if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2876547 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2876548 complete genocide putin also said georgia had effectively lost the right to rule the breakaway province an indication moscow could be preparing to fulfill south ossetians wish to be absorbed into russia
2876549 it was a good impression of world war three wasnt it i am a bit disappointed at the end but we are getting down to the part of the season where you take no prisoners with all the yellow flags that came out it bunched the field up and you got a real knockdown drag out in the end it was pretty much as i thought a fuel consumption race we had to make fuel the championship is tighter than ever which means everybody is going to be a little bit more tightly wound at the next race
2876550 from the beginning i was driving normally i was not pushing very hard the car was very very quick in the beginning there were two safety car procedures in a row where it kept the gap close so it was not an advantage for me to be quick i had some bad luck with traffic and lost two positions our strategy from that point on worked out perfectly we double stinted our michelin tires when i was in the car in the beginning the tires were perfect they dropped off a little bit at the end of the double stint we collected points and it is good there are still four races to go and a lot can happen
2876551 it was not the easiest race for anybody because of the circumstances there were lots of yellows which i was not expecting lots of confusion in the beginning with the time keeping the race was delayed 11 minutes for a timing and scoring malfunction i really had to push the car my first stint in the car was amazingly good at the end it was very difficult for me because there was no right mirror the glass was broken when farnbacher was overtaken for the lead and the number 45 car was losing huge amounts of oil my windscreen was completely covered in oil and with the sunset it was like a blind ride the final lap was just all over the place going towards turn five i had contact under braking and i went sideways going out of the corner i nearly lost the car and made contact as well it was really tough to get the car back on the track i am happy with third we lost a few points to the leaders but still everything is wide wide open we need to just look forward and keep pushing
2876552 alex did a really good job during his stint he was having trouble with the gearbox on the up shifts i felt it more on the downshifts when i got in the car we took a roll of the dice and kept him out during a caution and we had to fuel under green it was a good gamble we got up to third place alex did a great two hours i was working on my times and something fluid had to be down on the track i had a massive spin in turn 14 and went into the tire wall we fixed the damage and just got right back up on it the car had a push after that but it was kill or be killed out there it made for an interesting evening i am very proud of the 71 car for the podium and the whole team
2876553 there is a gap in skills between the chinese team and the korean team we wanted to make the breakthrough but sadly we didnt achieve it
2876554 its my best time and an olympic gold medal thats more than i could have ever dreamed for
2876555 oh i want to change and live my life for the lord
2876556 oh i dont have a cell phone like the other kids or a laptop or sony playstation
2876557 does the body rule the mind or does the mind rule the body i dont know
2876558 im glad that weve put to test this vaunted automated election in the autonomous region this electoral exercise is very historic being the first ever automated elections in the armm
2876559 we c an not end poverty until we took a careful look at wealth
2876560 ive got a heart full of rubber bands that keep getting caught on things
2876561 why wont america and nato help us if they wont help us now why did we help them in iraq
2876562 the top of it is totally broken off and the storm severely damaged 70 to 80 percent of the tree
2876563 that means theres not a whole lot left of it but it didnt kill the tree
2876564 was there as a silent witness to the battle to the aftermath to the burials to the dedication of the cemetery
2876565 i have no doubt that union soldiers sat under it for all three days of the battle
2876566 when its something this bad its highly doubtful that a tree like that can survive
2876567 will need an additional 29 000 to 50 000 rental units affordable to low income households to reach pre katrina levels
2876568 when i got there the house was down and i was like am i at the wrong place
2876569 i called the number on the letter they sent and someone told me it had been taken off the demolition list
2876570 i called back a few months later and they said its ok but we better take another picture of it boarded up the next day i went to take the picture and the house was down
2876571 the problem is the city is bulldozing properties that are neither dangerous nor abandoned people are not being told their buildings are in line for the wrecking ball until it is too late or if luck is on their side almost too late
2876572 homeowners like those at the st ferdinand house who were cited many months ago cannot now fairly determine if their home remains on a city demolition list
2876573 these demolitions are evidence of a very broken system that has not been fixed even after the courts made an agreement
2876574 the end result is there is no safety net of reliable information for homeowners and intact houses are at risk of being lost
2876575 all imminent health threat properties that have been condemned by the city
2876576 they havent been giving proper notice to people whose homes are on the list to be demolished
2876577 the bottom line is they were demolishing homes that could be saved and saving homes that could be demolished and we are trying to change that by putting neighborhood leaders on the committee and making the hearings more open
2876578 how hard is it to delete a name from a list or knock on a door i just dont get it
2876579 seluruhnya ada enam gram kurang lebih tapi tidak bagian kepemilikan satu orang bersama sama

2876583 lebih tertarik sama yang beda sama aku ada sesuatu yang bisa dipelajari
2876584 ada perkembangan baik sekali dibanding minggu lalu sudah bisa mengenali orang
2876585 the language in there is so similar to the language in the left behind books
2876586 it should be known that in 2008 the world shall be blessed they will call him the one
2876587 a nation healed a world repaired we are the ones that weve been waiting for
2876588 when i was in australia they had a placenta tree that was on the river and all the placentas of all that tribe all that clan whatever aboriginal tribe that was all the placentas went under that one tree and it was this huge behemoth of just health and strength
2876589 this tree was just growing taller and stronger above the rest of mother nature around it it was gorgeous

2876601 paris is determined to make a go of this club shes investing a lot of her own money into the project and believes she can make a go of it by roping in all her celeb pals to check it out
2876602 a small fortune is being spent on interior design paris wants a classy decadent feel to the space but with an animal print motif running throughout the ladies loos will be pink and shes getting diamante studded leather sofas and bar stools
2876603 she sourced the location about four months ago and has already paid for the lease which didnt come cheap the idea is to get the club up and running before the end of the year and to host the wildest new years eve party ever
2876604 there were no containers for those drugs in his apartment
2876605 the first time we knew he had taken those drugs was after the autopsy was performed
2876606 it is almost as though he had deliberately ensured there was no trace of their origin where he got them from
2876607 either that or someone removed the containers from the scene a third theory of course is that there never were containers for those drugs that he bought them from a street dealer we just do not know
2876608 it would have compelled her to spill we still want to know whether there was drug use and its sources if any
2876609 all the other people involved in this case have been very cooperative the doctors the masseuse who found the body the bodyguards who arrived at the scene mr ledgers former partner michelle williams
2876610 olsen is the last individual in this investigation who may be able to tell us where heath ledger got the drugs that caused his death
2876611 what has she got to be worried about she was the first person to receive a call from the masseuse who discovered ledger and we want to know precisely what she said
2876612 relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding the death
2876613 right now good legal advice has to trump any other advice she may be getting in terms of perception publicity shes done the prudent thing
2876614 if the feds wont give her immunity then they suspect she had some involvement legal advice says she should protect her rights
2876615 sure part of this investigation is an exercise in publicity there are 63 million americans who have been through drug rehab one in 10 of high school kids takes vicodin and one in 20 abuses oxycontin they are people likely to overdose
2876616 he said he could not see me that night but really wanted to meet me the next day
2876617 he made me promise id call him in the morning and wake him up i tried
2876618 she waited outside his room and tried calling him on his cell phone and he did not respond
2876619 she went into the room she started setting up the massage table and he wasnt waking up
2876620 dependent users normally move on to heroin because its cheaper
2876621 in heath ledgers case it seems to have been the opposite
2876622 as things stand we may never now know where he got those fatal drugs
2876623 i was horrified to learn that he hadnt been contacted about the change in arrangements
2876624 ive apologised and weve had a good discussion about that its a very unfortunate set of circumstances
2876625 without diminishing the callous and brutal nature of this crime which was certainly committed partly for financial gain and with no regard to the sanctity of human life i believe that a determinate sentence is appropriate
2876626 my client states his instructions are that ben clark acted alone and that is what we maintained throughout the trial and unfortunately the jury did not accept that
2876627 cpi inflation is expected to be higher in the short term at around 5 per cent in the december quarter reflecting the effects of higher petrol prices and the recent correction to estimates of financial services inflation before declining thereafter
2876628 a move in november is a likelihood rather than september
2876629 theres still a fair bit of talk of elevated inflation and that suggests theyll wait for the next cpi before they move
2876630 the way this statement reads its just a little bit of hosing down how excited the market was getting for a 50 basis point rate cut
2876631 when they do start to cut its more likely to be a smaller cut rather than big cuts
2876632 the reserve banks been pretty clear and lucid in terms of slowing growth and is signalling rate cuts are not too far off
2876633 we certainly think well get one in the next few months and certainly by early next year
2876634 were actually saying november or just within the next three months and certainly one will be in by february
2876635 the evidence to date is that a significant moderation in demand is now occurring and it is looking more likely the demand will remain subdued and economic growth will be fairly slow in the period ahead
2876636 while inflation is likely to remain high in the short term the board judged at its august meeting that demand was slowing to an extent that could be expected to bring about a significant reduction in inflation over time
2876637 on this basis the board decided that the existing monetary policy setting was appropriate for the time being
2876638 on the assumption that the subdued demand conditions are like to continue scope to move to a less restrictive monetary policy stance in the period ahead is increasing
2876639 the combination of falls in housing and equity prices means that household net wealth has declined in the first half of this year
2876640 so im in town for the porn star convention this weekend
2876641 i know the bad things he does to me are my fault hes really a good man and maybe if i wouldve shut up and not talked back he wouldnt have slapped me in my mouth maybe if i hadnt cursed him out or degraded his manhood he wouldnt have yelled at me maybe if i had changed my dress instead of telling him what i wasnt going to wear he wouldve allowed me to go out with my girlfriends maybe if i could learn to sex him better suck his amp a little longer or stopped telling him no more than i said yes hed stop cheating on me
2876642 my blessings unto you are useless if you dont acknowledge the fact that they are yours
2876643 trust in me your ability to connect to me is there focus your attention on yourself not him the time has come for you to stop believing that your relationship with him is the only one you are worthy of stop hiding behind your contrieved smile stop crying yourself to sleep at night stop acting like everything is all right stop putting him before your children my child let not your heart be troubled
2876644 i approve this message blablabla im 1 000 years old
2876645 they say you are what you eat and with any luck i could be you by tomorrow morning
2876646 adjusting and constantly evolving expanding and trying to stay as young as i can
2876647 could use a little more substance like we had in the day
2876648 theyre standing on our shoulders some of them dont realize it because they sample me so much
2876649 i started to walk out i thought it was a disney thing i had never heard of this thing
2876650 toward the opening i started having trepidations oh my god what have i done ive ruined my career but when it aired the ratings went through the roof
2876651 i have to play before i die or get wrinkly
2876652 lean ground beef family pack not to exceed 20 fat
2876653 we were focused on the products that were going out for grinding
2876654 we were focusing on the product that we tied to the initial illnesses
2876655 der wald in der steiermark holt sich seine almen zur ck
2876656 viele almen wurden in den letzten jahren zusammengelegt manche bauern beschlossen sogar die wirtschaft im tal aufzulassen und sich ganz in den bergen niederzulassen wodurch die almwirtschaft als solche aus der statistik rutscht
2876657 last night felt very easy it was such a relaxed swim this morning i just didnt have it at the end
2876658 i think i forced my stroke and it fell to pieces a bit
2876659 church forms a cirice cyrice chiriche churiche chereche b circe cyrce chyrce cirke etc etc
2876660 so he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness and i saw a woman sit upon a scarlet colored beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and ten horns
2876661 it depends on the event the rarity and the profile of the sportsperson mr swarv said
2876662 when peter brock passed away ebay went from 26 brock products to 2500 he said
2876663 when shane warne retired his memorabilia went through the roof
2876664 to compensate for the additional risk of the inefficiency of the market you are dealing in
2876665 most of these things never pay an income unless you are prepared to rent it out to someone he said
2876666 sure you can two per cent if that mr whitford said
2876667 i would say you would fit it in the crazy money portion that you dont expect to see it come back he said you dont want to bet the farm on it
2876668 dont get caught up in the hype these things are always the flavour of the month but then theres another flavour he said
2876669 i know of no one who has retired on sporting memorabilia except for sportsmen themselves
2876670 they make the mistake of hanging it on their walls and breaching the in house assets test and the sole purpose test he said adding that penalties were up to two years in prison and a 220 000 fine
2876671 i dont think theres too much money to be made out of australian rules football he said most collectors do it for personal experience and do not want to on sell it
2876672 its like willy wonka and the chocolate factory a golden judd or a golden goodwin mr bickley said most shops selling sporting memorabilia have disappeared in south australia in recent years
2876673 a lot of people google us looking for specific items he said
2876674 a shopfront can only carry so much stock and what if youre not carrying the right stock its hard to run a store unless you are doing daily turnover with online you are not paying rent
2876675 we sell tendulkar stuff to india because they dont have memorabilia shops in india and theres massive danger there of pirated products ip theft and forged signatures he said
2876676 why could labour find 25 million to save endangered snails which werent endangered but cant find 25 million to save endangered women
2876677 we cant have politicians intervening to decide which drugs should be funded and which should not
2876678 politicians do not have the clinical expertise to make decisions about which drugs to fund however much we might wish to interfere we must leave it to the experts to decide
2876679 its not about who can scream the loudest and who can make the most noise
2876680 pharmac is hiding behind clinical issues in order to attempt to justify its refusal to fund herceptin and other innovative and modern medicines
2876681 how can the new zealand population feel confident that pharmac have got this and potentially other decisions right while everyone else in the oecd has got it wrong
2876682 this decision is clearly symptomatic of an organisation that is chronically underfunded to do the job they are expected to do
2876683 its a stupid to assume that we as humans lack the ability to sustain order without religious tradition
2876684 every man does that which is right in his own eyes
2876685 every man does that which is right in his own eyes
2876686 revelation is an nwo tool to make christians stand down
2876687 revelation is an nwo tool to make christians stand down
2876688 what i resent is all the phony christians ive run into who arent real christians who tell me
2876689 thats my problem is that when hitler was slaughtering people all over europe most christians literally laid there and took it because they said oh hes the anti christ this is the end of the world
2876690 and so im saying that i have a choice to make i have to in this one life to live im being tested and im not going to just say the games outcome is already you know the die are already cast and so im not going to be involved and im not going to try to do something and take action
2876691 but no i totally agree with what youre saying sir its just that i have found that religion has become this big blanket people rap themselves in and then dont ever do anything
2876692 why wont america and nato help us if they wont help us now why did we help them in iraq
2876693 the president and mr putin were in animated conversation two seats in front of us and i imagine they had a few things on their agenda
2876694 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2876695 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community
2876696 we cannot just go out alone on this and talk and act unilaterally we dont have much impact i believe in terms of our unilateral declarations anymore with the administrations approach to the world
2876697 were alarmed by this entire situation and every escalatory step is a further problem
2876698 if those russian ships leave that port in the black sea and if ukraine decides that it is not going to allow those ships back into that port that is a potentially much greater conflagration involving a wider regional area
2876699 we hope that there is no further bloodshed there has been too much bloodshed already
2876700 right now our focus is on working with both sides with the europeans and with a whole variety of international institutions and organizations to get the fighting to stop
2876701 it has to be condemned and the world needs to stand against it
2876702 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2876703 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2876704 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2876705 we cannot just go out alone on this and talk and act unilaterally we dont have much impact i believe in terms of our unilateral declarations anymore with the administrations approach to the world
2876706 were alarmed by this entire situation and every escalatory step is a further problem
2876707 if those russian ships leave that port in the black sea and if ukraine decides that it is not going to allow those ships back into that port that is a potentially much greater conflagration involving a wider regional area
2876708 right now our focus is on working with both sides with the europeans and with a whole variety of international institutions and organizations to get the fighting to stop
2876709 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2876710 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2876711 clearly there have been incidents on both sides but this is obviously a planned georgian operation a contingency plan they have had for some time to retake south ossetias capital tskhinvali
2876712 possibly the georgians calculated that with putin in beijing they could recapture the capital in two days and then defend it over the next two months because the russians wont take this lying down
2876713 russia should not be blamed for the fighting but russia should now be pressured not to go beyond its peacekeeping mandate and to ensure that armed militia do not cross the border into south ossetia
2876714 this pushed georgia into a philosophy of self reliance the idea that georgia will be able to regain breakaway entities only by its own means
2876715 the elephant in the room behind this whole story is georgias nato prospects
2876716 it might be a signal to the russians saying that the sochi olympics will not go the way russia wants if there is no progress on the settlement in abkhazia
2876717 and taken to tbilisis notorious isolator number 7 the scene of well documented torture of political prisoners since 1991
2876718 the style of saakashvilis governance has made dishonesty injustice and oppression a way of life everyday repression demolition of houses and churches robbery kulakization and murders i would stress murders have become common practice for the authorities
2876719 the request for a previous withdrawal of the invaders is just and our government supports it
2876720 the autonomous republic of south ossetia historically formed part of the russian federation
2876721 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2876722 georgia should move back to the line of 1992 according to dagomisk treaties treaty of non violence should be signed talks can not happen without a non violence treaty
2876723 international tribunal about south ossetia needs to be launched all facts all names all victims must be told out and accused

2876725 the vice president praised president saakashvili for his governments restraint offers of ceasefire and disengagement of georgian forces from the zone of conflict in the south ossetian region of the country
2876726 the vice president told president saakashvili that russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community
2876727 there was massive bombing of gori all evening and now we are getting reports of an imminent attack by russian tanks
2876728 gori is being bombed massively from the air and from artillery as well
2876729 are not there yet but it looks like they are getting ready for it
2876730 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2876731 this is our field of battle this is what we can do
2876732 they have a lot of artillery and tanks but we have heart
2876733 everybody left us because georgia has no gas or oil
2876734 the united states and the european union spat on georgia
2876735 there is still a big danger that russia might decide to do the complete job but its not something that people are going to stand for
2876736 the russians came in and started taking busloads of women and children
2876737 we were suspicious because in the last 20 years weve never seen any mobilization like this
2876738 we thought that this year all the refugees would be returned to their places but now there are 20 times more refugees
2876739 i have been lying here for three days and i need shelter
2876740 they cant run this state they cant recover from this situation the army is in disarray they have no leadership they are going from one place to another without any direction im not a prophet but i have a lot of experience we wont be able to go back there its impossible its finished
2876741 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2876742 they seem to have gone beyond the logical stopping point
2876743 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2876744 georgian missile boats today made two attempts at attacking russian warships
2876745 russian navy ships opened retaliatory fire as a result of which one of the georgian boats that staged the attack sank
2876746 four quickly moving sea targets were spotted today during the russian ships patrolling near the abkhazian coast they violated the border of the declared security zone and were not reacting to warnings these targets were approaching our ships the russian ships fired warning shots and then opened artillery barrage fire as a result of the quick sea battle one target was hit and three others turned and sailed towards poti
2876747 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2876748 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2876749 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2876750 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2876751 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2876752 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2876753 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2876754 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2876755 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2876756 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2876757 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2876758 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2876759 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2876760 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2876761 you know that whole at amp t ad campaign about
2876762 what i hate is what cellphone companies have done with cellphones theyve loaded them down with features no one needs while doing a miserable job of making them be what they were originally supposed to be ie a reliable mobile telephone
2876763 and what i realize is that i know neither my mother tongue nor english well enough to be able to write creatively in either
2876764 maam sir i didnt get that could you explain it again please
2876765 in much of africa for instance tourism is the major source of income and often the only source of foreign currency
2876766 how do you compete in a world in which a portion of business travel is replaced by teleconferencing
2876767 i am well aware of the need to embrace change for the sake of the environment but many people in the audience sponsored the keynote speakers attendance through their delegate fees
2876768 its like the rifle association presenting at a gun control convention

2876784 someone in japan heard it at a japanese record company and he said
2876785 educate people that the climate crisis is both urgent and solvable
2876786 we ensure that every product or service they offer through the campaign makes it easier or cheaper for you to do your bit and help tackle climate change
2876787 ralph nader is not a protest candidate he is not for sale and neither is my vote
2876788 i am not voting for a third party or a third person nor is my vote a protest vote and obama has the support of democrats not necessarily liberals liberals like myself are backing ralph nader
2876789 third or fourth party presidential candidates could garner enough votes in november to make a difference in some of the hotly contested swing states
2876790 i cant vote for anybody who doesnt call for an immediate end to the war in iraq
2876791 the war under post nuremburg laws is a criminal war of aggression its illegal we have no right as a nation to debate the terms of the occupation we have no right to be there
2876792 a few things we wont tolerate personal attacks obscenity vulgarity profanity including expletives and letters followed by dashes commercial promotion impersonations incoherence and shouting
2876793 personal attacks obscenity vulgarity profanity including expletives and letters followed by dashes commercial promotion impersonations incoherence and shouting
2876794 campaigns and parties often use dirty tricks to suppress the vote
2876795 you dont need any proof you just see it its in here everyday
2876796 you can see the rivers turning color and dead fish
2876797 i see where i live i live in costa rica at the moment and its very beautiful and clean
2876798 i see the difference about how the us is treating all its resources
2876799 i ride a bike i dont drive a car little things but i still us too much
2876800 its the price of gas i think that has made people think a little bit more about improving their lifestyle and giving back to the earth
2876801 my goal is to show people how to cook local produce
2876802 it doesnt have to be transported all the way across the country or across the globe
2876803 it predates me being involved in politics or him being involved in politics im older than him so i serve an older brother role i hope he feels ive been there for him and hes certainly been a very loyal and terrifically helpful colleague
2876804 one of the roles ive always wound up playing is being a translator telling people yes he has a different approach hes serious about change this is what it means and my relationship with him gives credibility to that
2876805 my dad is one of the people who taught me how to laugh
2876806 the group had sort of a smothers brothers like routine they would sing songs and they would tell topical stories talk about current events tell a few jokes sing songs and you know thats my dads personality
2876807 i ended up delivering packages to these glittering buildings in downtown chicago and when youre a kid growing up in chicago these are the most important buildings in your life
2876808 in a permanent state of zen very even handed very mild mannered
2876809 when you meet him you feel like youve always known him
2876810 half the time hes coming in to give you bad news or ask you to do something youre not sure you want to do
2876811 but he walks down the hall hes got a smile on his face hes likable youre still happy to see him
2876812 he understands the importance of the personal touch and that e mails and phone calls are not always appropriate
2876813 there are times when a face to face is just the right thing to do he dropped everything and hopped on a plane
2876814 cheated on more times than a blind woman playing scrabble with gypsies
2876815 i think the market is responding to the fact that we are here talking
2876816 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
2876817 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
2876818 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
2876819 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
2876820 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
2876821 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
2876822 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
2876823 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
2876824 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
2876825 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
2876826 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
2876827 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
2876828 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
2876829 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
2876830 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
2876831 is designed to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind
2876832 loony liberalism a kind of ideological m nage a trois between timothy leary karl marx and al gore
2876833 matriarchal environmentalist multicultural anti male anti family anti individual and public hygiene shibboleths are enforced by orwellian regulatory agencies commissions and tribunals better known as the smoke smut seat belt thought language and calorie police
2876834 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
2876835 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
2876836 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
2876837 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
2876838 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members
2876839 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
2876840 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
2876841 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
2876842 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
2876843 we are proud to have published two best selling books by barack obama and are thrilled to have the opportunity to continue to work with his campaign on such an important and inspiring book at this critical moment in our country
2876844 having drafted their platform the democrats should reopen doors that never should have been shut toward pro life democrats
2876845 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
2876846 some places were unprepared some places just couldnt handle it
2876847 people know its going to be a historically high turnout whether they can do anything about it is another question
2876848 tens and sometimes hundreds of thousands of voters are disenfranchised sometimes raising serious questions about whether the intended choice of the voters was certified as the winner
2876849 the first couple of primaries get all the attention its decided and nobody turns out for other elections later on in the primary season
2876850 and that didnt happen this time and i think thats where some elections administrators in later primaries got caught
2876851 some might get lost or replaced or the person didnt fill out all the information and theyre not on the rolls
2876852 the one constant in republican victories in fall elections has been large margins in springfield and those surrounding counties
2876853 if you dont campaign hard in a region of the state that is growing that represents a lot of votes
2876854 a good performing republican will get 65 percent of the vote in greene and surrounding counties
2876855 this race will be fought and won in the margins
2876856 if youre a democrat and cant get north of 40 percent in greene county youre in trouble
2876857 a lot of things hes said have really turned off and angered a lot of people including greene county democrats
2876858 the threat of obama is enough to get the hard core conservatives out
2876859 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection
2876860 i want energy to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
2876861 ive been going there as an individual businessman for 40 years to washington
2876862 the richer i got the more polite they were did i get anything done hell no
2876863 i want to get to a million people by the time congress comes back in after recess
2876864 if they see with me a million people that are gonna write to them say something to them put pressure on them theyre going to listen to us i can promise you that
2876865 i dont have any profit motive in this im doing it for america
2876866 it will be similar to the eisenhower interstate highway period in the 1950s
2876867 he said it was an emergency i want it to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
2876868 and weve had a pretty good drop in the oil price
2876869 he believes in global warming i do too but global warming is on page 2 for me on page 1 its the 700 million going out the back door from our dependency on 70 percent of imported oil
2876870 and its also driving the key challenge for us which is energy independence
2876871 ive been working on this since i was elected in 1996 so i get excited whenever anybody else joins this effort
2876872 hes saying if you are not going to listen because im wealthy im going to shame you into listening to people its a great approach
2876873 he wasnt successful but he made a lot of money at it
2876874 eliminates peoples jobs and then asks the taxpayers to fund his new venture
2876875 american people are desperate for answers and if they get robbed in the process
2876876 the jonah factor 13 spiritual steps to finding the job of a lifetime
2876877 want to continue flying in your private jet and air conditioning your 16 000 square foot mansion and not worry about hurting the environment then send us your money and well offset the damage youre doing by planting trees
2876878 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
2876879 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
2876880 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
2876881 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
2876882 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
2876883 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
2876884 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
2876885 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
2876886 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
2876887 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
2876888 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
2876889 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
2876890 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
2876891 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
2876892 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
2876893 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
2876894 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
2876895 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
2876896 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
2876897 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
2876898 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2876899 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
2876900 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
2876901 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
2876902 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
2876903 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
2876904 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
2876905 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
2876906 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
2876907 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
2876908 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
2876909 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
2876910 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2876911 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2876912 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2876913 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2876914 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2876915 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
2876916 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
2876917 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
2876918 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
2876919 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
2876920 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2876921 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2876922 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2876923 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2876924 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2876925 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2876926 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2876927 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2876928 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2876929 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2876930 just so you all know we did set a record
2876931 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2876932 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2876933 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2876934 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
2876935 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
2876936 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
2876937 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2876938 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2876939 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2876940 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2876941 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2876942 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2876943 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2876944 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2876945 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2876946 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2876947 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2876948 we get blamed by people for being neanderthals but just because something is new doesnt mean its a good idea to include it in the debates
2876949 this has been something weve explored in the past and for a variety of reasons logistical and scale it couldnt come together
2876950 we offered our functionality with the notion that we knew the goal of these debates is all about information and education
2876951 its a way for americans to educate themselves in a different manner and ideally make a more informed choice when choosing their leader
2876952 i think it will change the process for elections to come
2876953 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
2876954 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
2876955 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
2876956 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
2876957 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
2876958 if black people kill black people every day why not have a week and kill white people
2876959 are you better off now than you were four years ago
2876960 clearly we shouldnt relax our guard just because we are automating the elections
2876961 this is the electronic equivalent of ballot boxes stuffed with ballots even before the voting has started
2876962 even though 27 votes each were recorded for their running mates
2876963 whether it paid bribes to win a venezuela election contract in 2004
2876964 the current way computers are used to record count and tabulate votes threatens the basic democratic principles of voting in secret and counting in public in dre you are already counting in secret
2876965 more than a technological problem election fraud is really a social problem and therefore calls for social solutions supported by technological means the only effective social solution to fraud is elections is eternal vigilance and punishment for the cheats
2876966 the lives of people especially the youth who will sign up on the red list will definitely be in the red meaning stepping into the danger zone
2876967 the only issue that hit home is the war because of him
2876968 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2876969 the un secretary general had not uttered a word meaning that he respects our law and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us air it out in clarion call to say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2876970 why should gore and the former us vice president give judgment of evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning for the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2876971 but if they had any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2876972 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2876973 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
2876974 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2876975 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
2876976 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
2876977 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
2876978 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2876979 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2876980 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2876981 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2876982 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2876983 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2876984 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2876985 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
2876986 thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded
2876987 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
2876988 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
2876989 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
2876990 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
2876991 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
2876992 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
2876993 if every american were to pitch in 2 000 we could pay off this years deficit or if we handed over each of us 500 gallons of gasoline or in terms we could all really understand if every american gave up 666 lattes for a year we could pay off this years deficit
2876994 the people who can affect the price of oil would prefer a republican presidential candidate watch the price of oil if it goes down which it may very well it could help john mccain quite a bit
2876995 its not only obamas youth eloquence and energy that have stolen hearts across the atlantic obama has raised expectations of a chance for the nation to redeem itself in the role that europe has loved respected and relied upon
2876996 the 200 000 plus crowd confirmed his rock star status and his more cooperative sounding rhetoric was what the crowd wanted to hear
2876997 mr obamas weeklong tour of war zones and foreign capitals is noteworthy because it is so unusual to see a presidential candidate act so presidential overseas
2876998 sen obama is not just tacking gently toward the center hes lurching right when it suits him hes zigging with the kind of reckless abandon thats guaranteed to cause disillusion if not whiplash
2876999 however you feel about her politics i feel that received some of the most unfair hostile coverage ive ever seen
2877000 if theres anything we need to rescue us from the last eight years its brains good judgment and experience obama has the first two gore has all three
2877001 i have fundamental differences with on the issues and always have i dont have any problem criticizing john mccain
2877002 obama is something special a man who makes difficult tasks look easy who seems to touch millions of diverse people with a message of hope that somehow doesnt sound pollyannaish
2877003 ive been covering presidential campaigns since 1960 i have always said i have never seen the media as much entranced by a candidate than when they were in my very first campaign in 1960 when they were for jfk but im telling you right now the enchantment with obama beats the jfk syndrome
2877004 i knew ronald reagan ronald reagan was a friend of mine barack obama is no ronald reagan
2877005 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
2877006 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
2877007 i didnt bring it into the courts mr gore brought it into the courts
2877008 richard nixon when he lost to john f kennedy thought that the election had been stolen in chicago which was very likely true with the system at the time
2877009 but he did not even think about bringing a court challenge that was his prerogative so if you dont like the courts getting involved talk to mr gore
2877010 bear in mind that the issue wasnt whether or not the election was going to be decided by a court or not it was whether it was going to be decided by the florida court or by the united states supreme court for a federal election
2877011 i mean one side or the other was going to feel that was a politicized decision but that goes with the territory
2877012 i dont think our legal system should be that complex i think that any system that requires that many of the countrys best minds and they are the best minds is too complex
2877013 if you look at the figures where does the top of the class in college go to it goes into law they dont go into teaching now i love the law there is nothing i would rather do but it doesnt produce anything
2877014 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
2877015 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
2877016 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
2877017 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
2877018 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
2877019 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
2877020 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
2877021 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
2877022 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
2877023 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
2877024 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
2877025 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
2877026 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
2877027 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
2877028 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
2877029 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
2877030 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
2877031 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
2877032 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
2877033 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
2877034 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
2877035 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
2877036 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
2877037 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
2877038 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
2877039 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
2877040 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
2877041 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
2877042 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2877043 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2877044 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2877045 axelrods not the type to drop a refrigerator on a guys head hell take the refrigerator apart drop one piece at a time and save the biggest piece for last
2877046 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2877047 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
2877048 this is a classic washington story anonymous quotes from armchair quarterbacks with no sense of our strategy data or plan
2877049 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2877050 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2877051 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2877052 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2877053 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2877054 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2877055 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
2877056 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
2877057 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
2877058 our dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been thirty years in the making and was caused by the failure of politicians in washington to think long term about the future of the country
2877059 this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of
2877060 any time you pick up a newspaper and see the terms climate change or global warming just think jobs for michigan
2877061 believe me the production people can do it if they really try
2877062 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
2877063 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
2877064 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
2877065 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
2877066 yuck im only a half a mile into the run and its so smoggy i cant even see the spectators on the side of the road stop doing this
2877067 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
2877068 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
2877069 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
2877070 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
2877071 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
2877072 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
2877073 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
2877074 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
2877075 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
2877076 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
2877077 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
2877078 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
2877079 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
2877080 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
2877081 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
2877082 lamento uma coisa n o saber o que vai acontecer abandonar o mundo em pleno movimento como no meio de uma novela gostaria de poder levantar me de entre os mortos a cada dez anos e ir a uma banca de jornais n o pediria mais nada com meus jornais embaixo do bra o p lido ro ando as paredes regressaria ao cemit rio e leria os desastres do mundo antes de voltar a dormir satisfeito no ref gio tranq ilizador de minha tumba
2877083 creio que para sabermos se realmente o brasil mudou de patamar em termos de seu potencial de longo prazo teremos de esperar o momento em que os pre os das commodities come arem a cair antes disso dif cil julgar se a mudan a estrutural ou n o o forte aumento das commodities tornou as coisas muito f ceis para o brasil
2877084 when it comes to safety no one is above the law
2877085 we need an olympics of liberty not an olympics of oppression
2877086 i got a little hurt when i was taken to the ground but that does not compare to what is happening in tibet
2877087 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
2877088 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
2877089 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
2877090 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
2877091 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
2877092 the laws are so foolish as to have some apartments be rented at below market rents its a failure of the laws rather than the people who take advantage of it
2877093 the problem is the system the system is there and these people they go and rent the apartment
2877094 while there is legitimate disagreement on the details of the proposal given its promise the city would like to work with the federal government and the port authority to develop a limited pilot program similar to what the bush administration has recently proposed at newark to determine whether it would be successful in encouraging airlines to utilize larger aircraft in peak hour slots
2877095 by bringing this prosecution against a new york state senator and charities registered with the state of new york based on member items obtained from the new york state legislature the federal government improperly intruded on the primary authority of new york state to define and enforce its laws
2877096 the prosecutors action destroys any distinction between what is truly national and what is truly local
2877097 i feel there is a price you pay when you speak out against the administration currently in the white house

2877104 our penal code and criminal procedure code originate from the common law
2877105 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any power on earth to criticise another countrys internal administration of justice
2877106 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2877107 weve had enough of this criticism but if they have a substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2877108 we have been summoning people too often lately i think for now we just let this go
2877109 as the minister of foreign affairs i would like to send this message loud and clear stop meddling in our internal affairs
2877110 we can say the same thing about guantanamo we can say about the malaysians being detained there but we did not do that as we have respect for the systems of the world
2877111 what more with the creation of the asean charter we want to ensure a much brighter future for asean whether in the political economic security or socio cultural sphere
2877112 he did our house and ive hated it ever since
2877113 its teddy bear noir the characters are stuffed animals and its dark and edgy
2877114 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2877115 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2877116 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2877117 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2877118 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2877119 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2877120 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2877121 my prayer for all of them is that they will be one just as you and i are one father that just as you are in me and i am in you so they will be in us and the world will believe you sent me
2877122 it creates new union jobs including major growth areas like fios it takes a big step forward on health care and it brings hundreds of verizon business employees the union rights they deserve
2877123 over time this is a very important provision that will be worth a lot of money
2877124 since the 2002 statute was adopted authorizing the mayor to have sole control of vital decision making issues parents have been disgruntled with having little to no input themselves
2877125 our first priority is the safe closing of the hospital
2877126 these programs stimulate programs that we expect will make a positive difference in the delivery of high quality health care to all new yorkers
2877127 i couldnt see my hand in front of my face
2877128 i dont think there was much they could have done
2877129 all the team felt that feeling of helplessness and just wondering what we were going to do
2877130 we really felt the loss as one of our own thats why it really hurt so much is its so close
2877131 we were in the middle of practice and we saw him leave
2877132 you know the olympics it could be for anything it could be you guys want an interview it could be problems with tickets or logistics or practices we didnt know
2877133 we didnt know if it was something related to u s a athletes or u s a volleyball or a random act of violence which we now know it was
2877134 id much rather be sitting on the bench telling him what i think he should be doing and having him say i dont think so rather than be where i am right now
2877135 were completely aware that we may see him we may not
2877136 thats complete all right with us he has priorities that he needs to take care of
2877137 on paper obviously its a team that we should beat
2877138 team just relaxed a little bit and in a tournament like this as soon as you relax that means your focus goes away the other teams focus picks up of course then we were in a dogfight all the way to the end luckily we were able to regain our composure there in the fifth set
2877139 there somewhat is relief the day is over we overcame so much it was all kind of a whirlwind
2877140 and we got the nerves out and the mistakes out
2877141 i knew things were happening i couldnt control and that were obviously not very good
2877142 it was a little bit hard to go out from there
2877143 a few of us had tears in our eyes because we know how badly she wanted to be out there we said lets do it for her lets do it for our families lets do it for the people back home
2877144 hes extremely concerned about the damage this would do to public education
2877145 i should like someone to remember that there once lived a person named david berger
2877146 you feel like youre sitting inside the patients head doing the surgery
2877147 if the screen were bigger it would be like an imax experience
2877148 youd make an incision around and behind the ear take off bone from the skull and spine dissect around the spinal cord brain stem and through the cranial nerves to get this tumor
2877149 it kind of required a paradigm shift in neurosurgeons ability to see and be comfortable using an endoscope
2877150 i cant feel it i look in the mirror i cant see anything
2877151 the precision has to do with the instruments and the surgeons hands
2877152 the advantage is that you can see better with the endoscope because youre going in directly to the barrel of the tumor
2877153 the united states and the world community should stop intervention and invasion of my sovereign country
2877154 this is not about georgia anymore this is about basic values of humanity
2877155 i want to ask ambassador churkin is your governments objective regime change in georgia the overthrow of the democratically elected government of georgia
2877156 there are democratically elected or semi democratically elected leaders who do things which create grave problems for their countries
2877157 that the secretariat of the united nations and its leadership was not able to adopt that objective position that is required by the substance of this conflict
2877158 particularly from the lips of the permanent representative of a country whose actions we are aware of including with regard to civilian populations in iraq and afghanistan and serbia
2877159 play is the highest expression of human development in childhood for it alone is the free expression of what is in a childs soul
2877160 each time one prematurely teaches a child something he could have discovered for himself that child is kepto from inventing it and consequently from understanding it completely
2877161 the nursery school is a place where children are given back some of the things modern life has tended to take away from them
2877162 your rule is alien and it can never be popular you have much to bring to your subjects but you cannot turn india into england or scotland work through not in spite of native systems and native ways with a prejudice in their favour rather than against them and when in the fullness of time your subjects can frame and maintain a worthy government for themselves get out and take the glory of the achievement and the sense of having done your duty as the chief reward for your exertions
2877163 at the moment the pipeline is not running at any capacity because there was a fire
2877164 they need sea ports they need transportation infrastructure and primarily they want to get rid of us
2877165 america is far and we are near and they do not have the will to defend you nice country you have there it would be a shame if something happened to it

2877172 so early days yet but we will keep you posted as best we can
2877173 forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us
2877174 it was only there on rotting prison straw that i sensed within myself the first stirrings of good gradually it was disclosed to me that the line separating good and evil passes not through states nor between classes nor between parties either but right through every human heart through all human hearts
2877175 and on the whole do you know i have become convinced that there is no punishment that comes to us in this life on earth which is undeserved superficially it can have nothing to do with what we are guilty of in actual fact but if you go over your life with a fine tooth comb and ponder it deeply you will always be able to hunt down that transgression of yours for which you have now received this blow
2877176 berall da wo etwas ber die multiple sklerose geschrieben wird auch wenn es nur so ein funken ist den sauge ich jetzt auf um jetzt zu wissen das habe ich jetzt damit kann ich etwas anfangen damit kann man mir helfen oder auch nicht und bin definitiv auch darauf angewiesen weil ich kriege sonst nirgendwo informationen ich muss danach selber suchen
2877177 ich bin absolut dankbar dass es dieses medikament gibt und falls jemand unter ihnen dieses medikament bekommen soll kann ich wirklich nur sagen dass dieses medikament absolut hilfreich ist und eine absolut gute basis schafft
2877178 ich halte eine solche veranstaltung f r v llig unverantwortlich der patient erwartet eine neutrale informationsveranstaltung und was er geboten bekommt ist wie wir gesehen haben eine werbeveranstaltung in deutschland gibt es ein heilmittelwerbegesetz und in diesem heilmittelwerbegesetz ist ganz klar festgelegt dass eine werbung eine direkte werbung von pharmazeutischen firmen f r ihre produkte am patienten absolut verboten sind
2877179 mit dem neuen mittel lie en sich also tausende von leben retten
2877180 solche artikel sind schon fast als t uschung des lesers des patienten zu bezeichnen der patient leser erwartet einen sorgf ltig recherchierten artikel eines fachjournalisten d h es strahlt eine neutralit t aus die berhaupt nicht gegeben ist teilweise werden nebenwirkungen nicht erw hnt teilweise wird die erwartete hauptwirkung die n tzliche wirkung v llig bertrieben so dass letztendlich das produkt ber das gesprochen wird in einem viel zu g nstigen licht da steht und das ist v llig inakzeptabel
2877181 kann man sich darauf verlassen dass sie artikel in die zeitschriften rein bekommen
2877182 gehen sie von mindestens 40 artikeln aus das erreiche ich im schnitt je mehr geld sie haben desto gr er ist das medienfeuerwerk das man entfachen kann und das ist in dem bereich eine ganze menge wenn man davon ausgeht dass man eigentlich nicht werben darf
2877183 der mehrwert der ganzen geschichte ist jetzt nicht nur die beratung sondern es ist mit der redaktion vereinbart dass bei jeder telefonaktion ein sogenannter nachbericht erstellt wird wir schreiben die nachberichte
2877184 wird heute h ufig das moderne tysabri eingesetzt das in solchen f llen besser wirkt
2877185 wenn sie jetzt zu mir sagen sie wollen in die bunte in der bunten vier seiten machen wir ihnen
2877186 je nachdem von der auflage her da m ssen wir schon mit 8 10 000 oder so was m ssen wir da hantieren
2877187 man muss die vereinbarung so treffen dass ihre firma au en vor ist
2877188 niemand hat die m glichkeit gegen eine zahlung an bunte dort einen artikel mit verdeckter medikamentenwerbung zu platzieren
2877189 jetzt letzte woche war auch wieder eine patientin hier ich hab ihr versucht das alles zu erkl ren dass das nicht richtig ist und dass das aus pharmakologischen gr nden eine falsche entscheidung w re ihr das medikament zu verschreiben sie ist dann als hausarztpatientin bei uns geblieben aber hat sich scheinbar bei einem anderen arzt dieses medikament geholt ich hab es vorgestern dann gesehen dass sie damit hier in der praxis stand
2877190 i wanted to go 1 45 and if it werent for that messed up finish i would have done it
2877191 i just wanted to save as much energy as possible for the relay

2877197 science is a way of helping people come to agreement
2877198 i would have been baffled if you do not say that was perfect
2877199 before the race i felt like i was going to vomit i was so nervous
2877200 people keep telling me i have to leave my cleats at the ball field
2877201 weve got to win that fourth one first before you can start thinking about being a four time gold medalist
2877202 youre constantly competing against incredible ballplayers so that means you raise your level of play
2877203 what a wonderful time it is for each of us to do his or her small part in moving the work of the lord on to its magnificent destiny
2877204 now what of the future what of the years that lie ahead it looks promising indeed
2877205 that shows how out of touch he is with michigan voters
2877206 hes pandering to san francisco liberals and environmentalists who would just as soon we not have cars
2877207 michigan would lose 37 400 to 56 260 jobs in 2020 and 91 490 to 121 786 jobs in 2030

2877225 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2877226 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2877227 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2877228 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2877229 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2877230 if oil were to start creeping higher again in the absence of clear fundamentals it would raise the risk of a partial reversal of recent moves
2877231 worsening economic prospects especially for the domestic economy are persistently strong
2877232 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2877233 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2877234 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2877235 thier lusts have progressed to wanting more than sex from us though they want to be robed often kidnapped like channon christian raped and killed it is widely reported that channon christian wanted the death by sexual torture scenario and staged it herself black woman booty
2877236 size of black male penis consitently appears in search results for our site
2877237 this is unusual because we dont publish sexual related content but because we do publish content specific to black males we get the traffic
2877238 oh i just got here two minutes ago its okay
2877239 therefore when god in his mercy chastens us he shows us and lays upon us only the lighter evils for god knows that if he were to lead a man to a full knowledge of his own evils that man would die at once
2877240 it s a good spot to be in and more importantly the car is running great
2877241 today we went out there and found the limit the first round single tomorrow doesn t matter we want to win the race and to do that you need to win four rounds obviously we re not worried about the first round thats the easy one it s the other three rounds that we re worried about we re in a beautiful place and the sun s going to be out and it ll be a little slippery and the driver is going to come into play and it s going to be fun that s what i wake up for there s a little gladiator in all of us
2877242 winning the last three races doesn t matter now you have to forget about the western swing you have to focus on this race every round there are guys out there who would like to win one race so to win five in a row is pretty tough you can t get caught up in trying to win four in a row or five in a row you have to stay focused on winning the round you are running when we finally get beat then we can talk about how many we were able to win in a row
2877243 its great to be no 1 but we really hope to win some rounds tomorrow
2877244 weve struggled at the last few races even though weve been qualifying well we just havent had any luck im happy about being no 1 but im trying not to get too excited this is the best qualifying performance weve had at john force racing in a while were all in the top half of the field so hopefully we wont race each other until the late rounds
2877245 we didn t set the world on fire today and didn t exactly build our confidence any perhaps we lulled the competition into a false sense of security and we ve got them right where we want them for tomorrow we ll be alright we knew the sun was going to be out today so we tried some things with the setup and just missed it because the racetrack didn t go away as much as we thought it might we did learn some things we know where the edge is now i am going into the first round thinking i ve got the baddest hot rod on the planet that s the confidence i get from the crew i ve got over there working on this car
2877246 i ve been fighting a little bit of a kidney stone and it s about to wear me out
2877247 we debuted a brand new bike here and i think we ve got a good bike for tomorrow we knew it was a good bike yesterday on the second pass yesterday i did a bad job of riding and it still ran a 6 98 we tried a test deal today on the second run and it didn t work out so tomorrow we ll go back to basics and we ll be alright
2877248 i ve been taking some tylenol for the pain i am going to the hospital tonight hopefully we can get it broke up tonight i ll spend some time in there if i have to
2877249 i just need to speak with truitt for a bit how about you whip us up one of your famous meals eh
2877250 hes fine you knew this would happen he wanted you to know he misses you no one got hurt it all went according to plan
2877251 well the guard will come to talk to you stay calm just like we rehearsed ok
2877252 i know its hard to understand but jail time isnt as bad as it sounds really and its not his first time
2877253 you look good truitt time off agrees with you or maybe its him
2877254 terribly sorry afraid i must run mabon you take good care of truitt alright
2877255 cartoon programming eyes schedule young animation force blog com announces
2877256 what is more i continue to consider all these things as a loss for the sake of the what is far more valuable knowing the messiah jesus my lord it is because of him that i have experienced the loss of all those things indeed i consider them rubbish in order to gain the messiah
2877257 i can ride a bike with no handlebars no handlebars no handlebars

2877286 i know that marylanders are frustrated and i take those frustrations with me to the capitol as i fight to go after the speculators and gas gougers who are manipulating our economy and for federal investments in alternative fuels that will bring costs down
2877287 our first responders small business owners and non profits in maryland and across the country are hurting because of high gas prices
2877288 today 62 of small business owners use a vehicle in their business and many are facing serious financial problems because of high gas prices at the same time we are seeing the effect of high gas prices on our first responders and we are experiencing a decline in services by the non profit community because they cannot afford the price of gas in the short term we need to provide immediate relief to americans in the long term we need new policies that will make us energy secure and end our nations dependence on foreign oil

2877309 and we can still work on our papers together right
2877310 i do too well youve got to get to work
2877311 this is the beginning of the re emergence of the russian sphere of influence in what was the former soviet union
2877312 we have made it clear to the russians that if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2877313 the russians need control over energy routes from central asia and the caspian sea in addition they want to get rid of us they want regime change every democratic movement in this neighboring region must be got rid of
2877314 he understands that its not really about georgia but in a certain sense its also an aggression against america
2877315 the russians are testing americas response are we going to help georgia to roll back the russian invasion or are we going to sit on our hands
2877316 this is part of the russian strategy of re imperialization because of their oil and gas wealth they feel emboldened
2877317 the russian position was they were ignored now theyre doing the ignoring
2877318 they were unrealistic to think the united states and europe would come to their military aid
2877319 russia cares about its reputation as a global power that gives the west leverage over what russia does
2877320 referred to the custom of going in a group from door to door at christmas or new year making a request for food or other gifts in the form of a song
2877321 john mccain believes in a strong national defense a smaller more accountable government steady economic growth and opportunity the dignity of life and traditional values
2877322 i ve found that recently on anglican blogs i haven t been writing the words preach the gospel i write instead preach christ and
2877323 i see the country full of confrontations i hope we find a way to be together
2877324 have been postulated to play a very important role in neurocommunication but in this field essentially no critical studies have been performed to address this issue
2877325 so i set up an experiment to create an animal model in which a particular group of neurons in the brain couldnt release a small neurotransmitter and by examining those animal models i could know the function of those molecules
2877326 we found that the mice without gaba release from agrp neurons have increased energy expenditure and are resistant to diet induced obesity
2877327 the function of agrp neurons is probably to reserve the energy for maintaining life
2877328 so if the animal doesnt have enough food the animal should have some strategy to preserve energy and this group of neurons by releasing gaba restrains energy expenditure to maintain enough energy to survive under the conditions in which food is not readily available
2877329 i think it makes the role of gaba in obesity much more relevant than previously thought
2877330 i sought him out because of my interest in metaphysics
2877331 i learned he was a clairvoyant and he gave me a reading one day out of the blue he said why dont you take a ballet class id never done anything onstage

2877333 richard was the strongest most secure partner i ever had you always felt like you were one with richard when you danced with him
2877334 he was my skating partner and we were regional champions in pairs roller dance
2877335 he approached being a minister with a lot of passion
2877336 he did his best to be inclusive rising above any squabbles and always kept his light shining
2877337 he was the nicest most patient human being ive ever met he was so inspiring
2877338 he looked healthy and strong in fine form and sang us all a broadway tune

2877341 russian circles is a three piece instrumental rock metal band from chicago similar to fellow chicago residents pelican russian circles play epic sprawling music which runs the gamut of heavy discordant metal to soft delicate passages they are also known for their energetic live shows which include tours with minus the bear chin up chin up mono and pelican as well as an appearance at the 2006 sxsw they were also the opening band for tool while playing in the united kingdom for their 2007 tour
2877342 i like to call it malignant malaise dealing with insurance companies crooked contractors still trying to get back into your house insurance rates going up people are having problems with that
2877343 people were displaced and our support systems disappeared our neighbors who used to be there for years and years in some cases are gone and people have trouble with that they look next door and their buddy is not their anymore
2877344 although they have started rebuilding their homes or trying to rebuild their homes or they may be still looking for a place to live cause we still have a lot of families displaced the stress level is high
2877345 the inability to finalize to put closure on an event brings depression
2877346 a judge should never speak to one side without the other being present
2877347 i think that most people would say thats not the way we do it
2877348 if i can assist someone and theyre not a regular violator i probably would have done it
2877349 knowingly accept in any case briefs documents or written communications intended to influence his or her action unless the contents are promptly made known to all parties
2877350 take care of it means look at it make sure its not a regular violator and depending on the nature reset for a hearing or give it to the court administrator or dismiss it
2877351 these communications apparently created the attitude on the part of individuals that because they knew him they would receive some degree of favored treatment
2877352 but to run a traffic court like that i think most would say thats not the way we do it
2877353 and i dont think that is what the public would want me to do
2877354 the times picayune editorializes on jamie perdigao and ronald sholes
2877355 i have signed a decree on a state of war georgia is under a state of total military aggression by the russian navy air force large scale ground operations

2877358 they really love barack obama in germany hes like a rock star over there impressive until you realize that david hasselhoff is also like a rock star over there
2877359 of course obamas supporters got him his usual birthday gifts of gold frankincense and myrrh
2877360 obamas people are trying to portray mccain as cranky and mccain is trying to portray obama as arrogant you see
2877361 see barack obama on the news hes becoming a workout fanatic hes at the gym like twice a day sometimes three times a day at the gym yeah according to his staff well he has to stay in shape to do those flip flops

2877364 we dont know whether the explosion was chemical or by virtue of its proximity to the toronto airport if a plane had crashed
2877365 were finding clear evidence that working on country has benefits for the health of aboriginal people and for the nation
2877366 the health benefits in terms of reducing levels of high blood pressure diabetes and kidney disease are quite striking when people are actively engaged in looking after their country
2877367 aboriginal elders and leaders set up these small settlements because it was important to their wellbeing and health
2877368 if you move people away from their land in an attempt to deliver better health and other services paradoxically you may sever the link that gives them both physical and psychological health
2877369 the health impacts derive partly from improved diet and fitness but are also due to the psychological and social effects of caring for country she explains
2877370 but they also mean people live longer lives in which they can contribute to their society grandparents for example can look after the kids longer or people can work for longer and generate more economic activity

2877416 punters just dont want to back north melbourne and even against the bulldogs yesterday we couldnt write a bet at 2 30

2877449 of course european football was a big reason for me coming here

2877477 in the case of invisibility cloaks or shields the material would need to curve light waves completely around the object like a river flowing around a rock
2877478 an observer looking at the cloaked object would then see light from behind it making it seem to disappear
2877479 i have really focused hard on the majors the last two years
2877480 i have turned up to other events and unless i get into contention it feels like a race or a sprint
2877481 where as a major feels like a marathon i feel like i can be patient and take my time i love the feeling of knowing that it is going to come down to the back nine and who can do it under pressure on the last nine holes
2877482 i am a great believer in making it your own responsibility whether you win or dont win i knew i was playing catch up and those are the moments that change tournaments when you take shots on and they come off and you have to do it on the back nine you are not going to win any other way
2877483 i had a discussion with my trainer back home and it was possible i was dehydrated
2877484 so that gave me something to focus on i focused on re hydrating myself whether that was the cause or not i dont know it might have just been tiredness
2877485 but at least i had something tangible that i could pin it on and try to put effort into it and it gave me the belief that if i get my hydration right my co ordination would come back
2877486 i have probably been the leading golfer in europe for close to six years
2877487 it is a big step to move up and start competing on a different level ive got tiger woods and ive got phil mickelson ahead of me
2877488 it is a long way to catch tiger at the top but i know that the only way of focusing on doing that is to focus on controlling what i can do i cant control tiger or phil i am going to continue to strive to improve
2877489 i love the idea of a back nine of a major on sunday so much that i am actually disappointed i am seven months away from the next major

2877492 he kind of had a moment of availability to do it and the strike got in the way
2877493 when i saw the ball pass the pitcher the game was over
2877494 i knew once i hit that ball i wouldnt be hustling if i didnt beat that ball out
2877495 to come back these last two games and get great wins like this it does so much for the spirit and mood of a ballclub the sense of confidence that goes throughout that clubhouse we got a couple of breaks there in the ninth but part of it is hustle the way they got down the line and beat out some balls
2877496 its always pretty fun to walk the dodgers off the field
2877497 they have done it to us in the past its good to finally give it back to them
2877498 ive got matt cain out there and matts been pitching well
2877499 you cant ask much more out of him right now for what he does he keeps making plays
2877500 it would be great to get a guy like watkins or a guy like rookie wide receiver chaz schilens if they were able to make the team
2877501 they both are guys that can contribute on special teams
2877502 i didnt know where i was going to be after each year whether i was going to sign with that team or if i was going to move on
2877503 but now im extremely excited i have a great opportunity on a team that is on the rise this team has great potential and im excited to hopefully be a part of it
2877504 it feels good to come out here and practice and hear the fans go oooh ahhh with the big catches interceptions and big hits
2877505 it just gives you energy for practice and we enjoy that
2877506 its just good to relate with the fans because lets face it weve been terrible the last five years and for them to still come out and support us the way they do my hats off to them
2877507 so i had darren stand next to me and told shane to throw him the ball
2877508 it was good to see coach rob ryan compete rob heard me whisper that so he whispered to hiram about 10 yards ahead of him to go cover him so it really didnt work

2877516 i knew that he was the one person with the combination of guts and passionate concern about the war who would take the risk of helping me
2877517 i knew what i was told about the war was totally false
2877518 in 1968 i came back and dan was across the hall at rand
2877519 he had been a total hawk in vietnam but everything about him seemed shattered it was as if he was trying to grow himself back he was going through a metamorphosis he was very tortured there was no way he could justify the war anymore
2877520 i know some of you will thumb through the book and go directly to the end to find out what happens
2877521 well dont waste your time because that is not the way i write
2877522 r amp b music had always consisted of love songs now songwriters started exploring the color barrier with their songs papa was a rolling stone and love child come to mind as examples of this shift
2877523 i told the guys that rich and i would go out and warm up the crowd with some comedy
2877524 and then we would play or attempt to play the tunes we rehearsed one bit melted into the next until we ended the show and had both forgotten entirely about the band sitting behind their instruments waiting to play
2877525 if i think we could make the movies like up in smoke today and i tell them no i was incarcerated for nine months simply because i made those movies back in the 70s and 80s it is in the court records i was incarcerated for nine months for taking responsibility for a box of glass water pipes that was shipped across state lines

2877527 is consistent with the moderation in economic growth seen in the second quarter
2877528 gdp growth in the second half is likely to be broadly similar to the first half
2877529 weaker demand in the major economies coupled with the need to contain inflationary pressures will dampen growth in the fast growing asian economies
2877530 the lower growth in the second quarter was mainly the result of a sharp contraction in biomedical manufacturing value added
2877531 stagnant growth in the electronics industry also contributed to the slowdown in gdp growth

2877539 right wing evangelicals who promote the left behind doctrine like tim lahaye john hagee hal lindsey and others believe the state of israel is key to bible prophecy
2877540 the proponents of this erroneous doctrine have unwittingly been pounding their theological hammers on u s foreign policy for over a century only to drive a bigger wedge between jews and arabs who want peace in the middle east
2877541 it took over 20 years of research to provide conclusive answers to the premillennial dispensational debate
2877542 when those preachers and teachers of bible prophecy read this book they will soon realize they have been promoting a militant and destructive doctrine instead of a genuine gospel of peace

2877584 usually when you need to use any usb device like scanner flash memory etc you plug it into usb port of your computer but for all that the device is accessible only for the computer it is plugged into and what if someone else needs to use the same usb device
2877585 you can unplug usb device from your pc and give it to another user but according to different circumstances not always there is a possibility to give usb device to another user even for a while or you can allow another user to work with that device on your pc but sometimes it is not possible to allow someone else to work with that usb device on your pc especially if another user is in the another office city or country it is possible to purchase the same usb devices additionally but additional usb devices could be purchased but it depends on the cost of the device and quantity required
2877586 fabulatech has resolved this problem in a different extraordinary way
2877587 weve created usb over network which allows to work with remote usb devices over a local network or internet all you have to do is to install usb over network server on the pc where usb devices are plugged in usb over network client must be installed on the pcs you want to give access to those very usb devices youve already plugged in thats all
2877588 you have to appreciate that and you have to respect that

2877594 before the race i felt like i was going to vomit i was probably that nervous
2877595 but then just before i walked out i had an amazing sense of calm
2877596 i just said to myself more than anything i want to walk away with absolutely no regrets

2877812 oh my stars this is serious zephyr he knows of the time travel spell
2877813 asquith there is something else lady jadrien has recovered she is planning something something to do with the capture of pallas
2877814 no old friend not all of the messages was available to read
2877815 here is the code maybe you can decipher it it might hold a clue to what her evil plan might be
2877816 that is true but there is no other choice pallas must be protected at all cost
2877817 im still tired too just wanted to check up on you
2877818 yeah thats why im calling let me wake up ol sparky and well be over soon
2877819 it always fascinated me that my mother could create such an amazing picture with just some fabric
2877820 yeah she was very talented i was never really good with sewing
2877821 the note you placed in the tin he thinks he may have discovered who wrote the counter spell for the traveling through time one
2877822 i well rhodium i am not sure of course but i think i know who wrote it
2877823 and it would make sense with all that is happening
2877824 yes asquith agrees with you he noticed the handwriting that it appeared to be pashas
2877825 rhodium i wasnt sure okay and we had enough chaos going on
2877826 what worries me is where the rest of paper is and who has it im thinking pasha had written the first part of the traveling spell down and for whatever reason didnt or couldnt hide or destroy the entire paper that somehow she only took the counter spell
2877827 i dont know rhodium just its almost like she intended for that paper to be discovered
2877828 i do not know we should inform asquith of this new
2877829 i wonder what reason she would have to do this
2877830 i do not know my lady but i think pasha would know and understand the consequences if she did
2877831 this opens up a whole new can of fear rhodium
2877832 we have to find out whats going on has pasha made any contact with asquith and the others that you know of
2877833 again i do not know but we can discuss this with asquith today
2877834 alright after we have coffee with the girls i will get ready to go

2877849 lets not irritate the physicians or else theyre going to take their patients to another hospital
2877850 the number one issue in the errors that occur is bad communication
2877851 the scissors didnt cut to his liking he was trying to cut suture material he said they were dull he tossed them across the room one of the nurses had to dodge the scissors
2877852 these incidents happen because the or environment is so high stress
2877853 surgeons hold patients lives in their hands yet theyre dependent on equipment and people who are outside their control this incident was over a year ago and there has not been another incident with this physician
2877854 you have an industry in crisis where people are having to do much more with limited resources that combination can be a potent one
2877855 its very unjust never once did i attempt to thrust atheism on these children i was scrupulously careful not to do that i was simply trying to persuade them to look at the evidence it was a pro evolution point rather than an anti religious point
2877856 i do get a bit exasperated at people hearing what they expect me to say rather than what i do say
2877857 perhaps the most powerful idea ever to occur to a human mind
2877858 we find no vestige of a beginning no prospect of an end
2877859 if you actually look at the god delusion including those bits people think are strident and shrill and so on i like to think theyre actually funny
2877860 a petty unjust unforgiving control freak a vindictive bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser a misogynistic homophobic
2877861 its a bit like the dilemma of a doctor who has a patient who has terminal cancer and the doctor has to decide whether to tell the truth or regard the patients private consolation as outweighing the truth if i were talking to an individual who had recently been bereaved i probably would hold my tongue in a way that i dont for anybody who chooses to read the book
2877862 you cant appreciate english literature for a start unless youre pretty knowledgeable about the bible if you dont understand what it means when someone alludes to
2877863 just glorious and its not just the music the drama of the passion of jesus as a work of fiction is something you can lose yourself in just as one can reading a novel you dont have to believe that heathcliff and cathy really existed to get caught up in the emotion
2877864 but if your main object is to understand how the universe works the question of whether or not theres a god in the universe is profoundly important
2877865 so i wouldnt wish to muzzle myself or anybody else for the sake of a skirmish in american schools about evolution
2877866 weve decided to do a five part mini series one big story that will run during one week
2877867 i wanted to make a really big noise about the show
2877868 torchwood really represents the essence of the channel its sexy action packed and a little bit subversive
2877869 so rumor has it that the bbc was unhappy and russell had to rush to write her out of series 3
2877870 personally id be very happy if they didnt add any more principle characters between jack ianto and gwen there are plenty of possible stories to tell for a season thats only having a five episode run
2877871 we want television screens in the west to be showing not only russian tanks and texts saying russia is at war in south ossetia and with georgia but also to be showing the suffering of the ossetian people the murdered elderly people and children the destroyed towns of south ossetia and regional capital tskhinvali this would be an objective way of presenting the material
2877872 this statement is a lie just like georgian president mikheil saakashvilis statement on the impossibility of using military force in conflict zones
2877873 como presidentes de la misi n de observadores del mercosur que integran legisladores y funcionarios nacionales de los pa ses miembros felicitamos al pueblo boliviano por el ejercicio pr ctico de transparencia democr tica que dieron hoy durante la celebraci n del referendum revocatorio en todo el territorio de la rep blica de bolivia
2877874 expresar al pueblo boliviano mi respeto y admiraci n pese a las provocaciones permanentes el comportamiento del pueblo boliviano ha sido totalmente exitoso hoy en este referendo revocatorio en bolivia lo que importa es en estos momentos es esa voluntad del pueblo boliviano esa voluntad tan pacifista del pueblo boliviano de participar en actos democr ticos para profundizar la democracia
2877875 one of the most purely entertaining hamlets i have ever seen
2877876 the doctor is scarred by losing his race he cant seem to hold on to anyone he is entirely alone even with the ones who do stick with him he is to all intents and purposes eternal thats his tragedy
2877877 its too easy to become defined by your press cuttings
2877878 im much happier going on a radio show and talking nonsense for 20 minutes i am an actor after all
2877879 he was 22 and had only just started acting yet his confidence and determination were extraordinary
2877880 often when we go out together large groups of women will visibly go weak at the knees
2877881 assume that growing up in a manse must be a puritanical existence
2877882 i was a junkie a doctor who junkie every saturday evening at 5 35 i could not be disturbed any noise or distinctive movement would be met with the wrath of a furious nine year old i was worshipping at the shrine
2877883 i didnt say a word to anyone apart from my doctor who doll
2877884 he was a very bright boy quick and witty he was an accomplished actor from early on
2877885 im the only scottish actor alive who hasnt been in taggart
2877886 you feel the weight of history there and its scary
2877887 wed established that we were both fans and he seemed the obvious choice i think david brings to it a fantastic sense of humour he can find lightness even in the darkest of scenes
2877888 the chinese and russians are favourite but britain australia and germany are all evenly matched for third
2877889 it has always been my dream to win an olympic medal but i did not expect it to happen here
2877890 i would like to work a bit harder going into london 2012 and see what happens then
2877891 daley is too young to go for the really big big dives as his body is not yet up to it
2877892 that means in the individual competition when it comes to later dives his older rivals can pull out a really big dives with a high tariff and daley can only hope they mess it up
2877893 but in the synchro it is easier for him and blake to match them
2877894 i watched the diving practice with a bunch of chinese volunteers while i watched the world and olympic champion guo jingjing going through her paces they watched tom daley sitting in a chair
2877895 thats when i realised how big tom daley is in china and the competition hasnt even begun
2877896 hes very handsome one teenager told me kind great talented were some of the other descriptions from youngsters scrabbling for an autograph
2877897 in china diving is a quite big sport so like walking around the streets you do sometimes get recognised in the village as well some of the chinese staff and at the diving pool as well some of a few people recognise you a bit
2877898 its kind of weird because when youre little and you always dream of being that person up there more famous and it is kind of weird to start getting that being recognised and it is really weird as you dont expect it to happen
2877899 going to an olympics at that age was good because it meant i bought the teeshirt got the cd so by the time moscow came around four years later i was not so over awed
2877900 i first met tom when he was 10 i was at a competition and was told this kid wanted to meet his hero which was a bit of weird thing
2877901 it was the taming of the shrew yesterday and that was a lovely day of calm
2877902 no we just put that on there for a laugh
2877903 ive got an audience listen you cant tell anyone you saw me do that okay its a secret
2877904 more beautiful than when i held my baby sister for the first time i met doctor who im going to be hysterical for months
2877905 my friends for christmas got me a t shirt that says mrs david tennant
2877906 i took the day off work saying i had a hospital appointment
2877907 aye right youll be regenerating as jimmy nesbitt in a minute
2877908 are you better what age are you thirteen i was 10 when i had it ive still got the scar look
2877909 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
2877910 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
2877911 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
2877912 defenderemos hasta las ltimas consecuencias nuestras tierras y espacios sagrados
2877913 a thoughtprint is unconscious communication hidden within verbal or written communication the unconscious mind is communicating constantly and typically hides its messages in verbal or written communication generated by the conscious mind we dont always say what we mean these unconscious communications are called thoughtprints
2877914 we want to stop the swift boating before it gets off the ground
2877915 legal trouble public exposure and watchdog groups digging through your life
2877916 and he will be a wild man his hand will be against every man and every mans hand against him and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren
2877917 this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come
2877918 but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived
2877919 putin was saying we are going to make them pay
2877920 what the russians just did is for the first time since the fall of the soviet union they have taken a decisive military action and imposed a military reality
2877921 theyve done it unilaterally and all of the countries that have been looking to the west to intimidate the russians are now forced into a position to consider what just happened
2877922 there is no possibility of drawing nato or the international community into this
2877923 strategically the russians have been sending signals that they really wanted to flex their muscles and theyre upset about kosovo
2877924 if someone went to the russians and said ok kosovo for iran wed have a deal
2877925 weve placed ourselves in a position that globally we dont have the wherewithal to do anything
2877926 ahhh there is nothing like the smell of fresh air
2877927 i just stepped in a whole pile of that fresh air
2877928 everytime i see you yes im feeling like i dream a lot your tender lips tender touch it makes me really hot i wanna love her but somethings telling me to not cross my heart hope to god this feeling never stops
2877929 slaves obey your earthly masters with respect and fear just as you would obey christ
2877930 juntando la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado con los estatutos auton micos
2877931 donde se pueda vivir sin el chicote l tigo del fundamentalismo aimara
2877932 la ratificaci n del pueblo en su voluntad de convertirse en una regi n aut noma
2877933 i dont understand youre so f cking hot but you dont have a boyfriend
2877934 i know this is weird but i cant play with you like i do other girls
2877935 well youre hot and were friends we are just friends right we dont do anything right
2877936 let every student be plainly instructed and earnestly pressed to consider well the main end of his life and studies is to know god and jesus christ which is eternal life john 17 3 and therefore lay christ at the bottom as the only foundation of all sound knowledge and learning
2877937 cursed is all learning that is contrary to the cross of christ
2877938 religion is the only solid basis of good morals therefore education should teach the precepts of religion and the duties of man towards god
2877939 let divines and philosophers statesmen and patriots united their endeavours to renovate the age by impressing the minds of men with the importance of educating their little boys and girls of inculcating in the minds of youth the fear and love of the deity in short of leading them in the study and practice of the exalted virtues of the christian system
2877940 in contemplating the political institutions of the united states i lament that we waste so much time and money in punishing crimes and take so little pains to prevent them we profess to be republicans and yet we neglect the only means of establishing and perpetuating our republican forms of government that is the universal education of our youth in the principles of christianity by the means of the bible
2877941 the only foundation for a republic is to be laid in religion without this there can be no virtue and without virtue there can be no liberty and liberty is the object and life of all republican governments
2877942 in my view the christian religion is the most import and and one of the first things in which all children under a free government ought to be instructed no truth is more evident to my mind than that the christian religion must be the basis of any government intended to secure the rights and privileges of a free people
2877943 christianity is the only true and perfect religion and that in proportion as mankind adopt its principles and obey its precepts they will be wise and happy
2877944 without morals a republic cannot subsist any length of time they therefore who are decrying the christian religion whose morality is so sublime and pure and which insures to the good eternal happiness are undermining the solid foundation of morals the best security for the duration of free governments
2877945 human law must rest its authority ultimately upon the authority of that law which is divine far from being rivals or enemies religion and law are twin sisters friends and mutual assistants indeed these two sciences run into each other
2877946 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
2877947 the great pillars of all government and of social life are virtue morality and religion this is the armor my friend and this alone that renders us invincible
2877948 the moral principles and precepts contained in the scriptures ought to form the basis of all of our civil constitutions and laws all the miseries and evils which men suffer from vice crime ambition injustice oppression slavery and war proceed from their despising or neglecting the precepts contained in the bible
2877949 man depends absolutely upon his maker for everything it is necessary that he should in all points conform to his makers will this will of his maker is called the law of nature this law of nature dictated by god himself is of course superior in obligation to any other it is binding over all the globe in all countries and at all times no human laws are of any validity if contrary to this and such of them as are valid derive all their force and all their authority mediately or immediately from this original
2877950 upon these two foundations the law of nature and the law of revelation depend all human laws that is to say no human laws should be suffered to contradict these
2877951 how has it happened sir that we have not hitherto once thought of humbly appealing to the
2877952 of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity religion and morality are indispensable supports in vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotism who should labor to subvert these great pillars of human happiness these firmest props of the duties of men and citizens
2877953 statesmen my dear sir may plan and speculate for liberty but it is religion and morality alone which can establish the principles upon which freedom can securely stand
2877954 w e have no government armed with power capable of contending with human passions unbridled by morality and religion our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people it is wholly inadequate to the government of any other
2877955 religion morality and knowledge being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged
2877956 it will be a long time before they can piece everything together and determine the accidents cause
2877957 we discovered the hoard with a metal detector and then we went down into the niche and found this small cooking pot inside it
2877958 kalau di polisi warnanya masing masing disesuaikan di polres polda di belakang kan ada tulisan tahanan
2877959 di rapat ini akan dibahas modifikasi caleg yang dapat jatah kursi aturannya seperti apa yang akan diatur
2877960 misalnya kalau nomor urut 4 yang mencapai suara nomor tinggi dibanding nomor urut 1 2 dan 3 apakah nomor urut 1 2 dan 3 ini harus mengundurkan diri
2877961 nggak ada masalah karena masalah bersama seperti teroris pencucian uang dan korupsi sudah menjadi masalah internasional jadi nggak masalah
2877962 karena dia klandestin alias alias saja sudah banyak telepon sudah banyak ganti mereka cenderung pada kurir
2877963 kewenangan penyadapan diizinkan tujuannya untuk perlindungan publik yang lebih luas selama itu dipertanggungjawabkan nggak apa apa
2877964 ini masih dalam penyidikan kita masih menunggu laporan dari kapolda papua
2877965 hari ini mereka siap untuk dimintai keterangan belum ada yang diamankan
2877966 well the truth is usually just an excuse for lack of imagination
2877967 like i always used to say always burn your bridges behind you you never know who might be trying to follow
2877968 the real breakthrough here is that were no longer required to use animal products which sometimes contain viruses that we cant detect
2877969 the properties i have worked with would suggest that potentially 50 increase is in stock numbers with additional development is do able
2877970 furthermore rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her privacy now or in the future
2877971 we still dont know whats wrong but yes it is a cancer scare
2877972 jade has undergone a series of tests but the doctors cant pinpoint the problem shes still in pain and its a worry
2877973 jade and jack are no longer an item but remain very close friends hes helping her out with the kids and has been great
2877974 this is an opportunity to nominate someone aged 60 years and over who has made a significant contribution to australian life and who continues today to give their time and energy to building better communities
2877975 for example volunteering builds social capital within communities and makes australia a stronger country in which to live and the voluntary work that many of our senior australians do really is invaluable
2877976 when you come to a fork in the road take it
2877977 the issue is how long do you leave a ticket in the marketplace knowing there may not be a top prize left but loads and loads of lower tier prizes
2877978 this isnt the first time this has happened and it doesnt surprise me anymore
2877979 politics takes precedence over sport with the iranians and the olympic spirit is as far from them as east is far from west
2877980 the bible is first of all our connection to the land
2877981 particularly paul that is really a big part of what he does as a storyteller
2877982 he very much comes from a regional australian angle itll certainly be an australian adventure being over there with them
2877983 i sing in my own accent i feel that there is a certain amount of australiana in my records in terms of native animal sounds and things like that and ive recorded a lot in the country i feel it comes through in a way but its not something i strive for i guess on a conscious level
2877984 he was really the only person i thought would be a good option i sent him some demos he doesnt work on anything he doesnt like hes not a gun for hire producer at all so i had to send him demos and he had to like them luckily he did
2877985 it sounds like a mark nevers record to me he has a particular beautiful sound he gets from drums vocals guitar and bass particularly all his records have a beautiful amount of bass on them and this i think is the most bass heavy album i have made
2877986 with mark it was very much performance based recording hes very traditional in that way it was all done very live i played guitar and sang at the same time we did no overdubs for vocals which was nice it was sort of a lot like the way tony and i recorded
2877987 i was really happy to have tonys input on a couple of these songs i got back from nashville and i missed him really badly on a couple of tracks and so it was a really beautiful connection between nevers style and tonys style
2877988 he was coming back through town and marky played him the demo from my song and asked him if hed like to sing it and he liked it it was really exciting for me he does such a beautiful job i cant really imagine the song sounding any better or any other way now
2877989 i was there last year with darren hanlon i got up and did a song with him which was fun i got to play the drums and sing at the same time i liked it so much that we decided that it was a priority for this tour to get up there luckily we got offered a show at the darwin festival so that made it easier for us to get there as well i kind of very much planned for this tour to be extensive and to go to lots of places that we havent been to
2877990 it is so beautiful and any excuse to go there especially if you can find these beautiful old theatres to play in
2877991 the theatre in pomona the majestic is the only silent theatre still operating in australia the milton theatres also beautiful and theres lots of gorgeous venues sitting there with nothing happening in them the idea is to go and go back and go back and hopefully you can build up a little community of people who come and see you play
2877992 la mina en bolas mas linda es la m sica
2877993 not a single test of this system has ever been carried out under realistic combat conditions
2877994 with american spending on missile defence set to dwarf most countries military budgets the profits to be made are massive but weapons makers cant bank on them yet
2877995 earlier this month president bush repealed an offshore drilling moratorium the same one his father signed in 1990 congressional bans on offshore drilling were enacted in 1981 and bush is urging congress to lift them as well the move is unlikely more than risking any environmental catastrophes or destroying critical natural habitats attempting to open additional offshore drilling fields is a great way not to come up with a long term solution to our energy needs and if you buy the argument that it is then its a great way to win the votes of an uninformed politically blinded or desperate american people the argument for new offshore drilling however is based more on election year posturing and political brush offs than science and logic americans who believe that drilling off the eastern and western seaboards will get us back to 2 or even 3 a gallon gasoline are in for quite a rude awakening offshore drilling wont even make a dent
2877996 the bush administration has decided to propose a drastic overhaul of u s fisheries environmental procedures
2877997 regional fisheries management councils would assume new environmental authority even though the councils continue to have members with commercial fishing interests
2877998 for more than a year u s federal officials have attempted sometimes in vain to quell rumors that the number of new hiv infections in the united states is on the rise the washington blade first broke the story in november 2007 reporting that the cdc was poised to raise the official estimate for the number of hiv infections believed to occur in the united states to a range as high as 58 000 to 63 000 per year a greater than 50 percent increase over the current estimate of 40 000 annual hiv infections
2877999 kevin fenton who heads the cdcs aids prevention efforts says the new data give the clearest picture yet of the u s aids epidemic
2878000 what the data actually show is that the 2006 estimate of roughly 56 000 new infections is substantially higher its about 40 percent higher than what had previously been estimated
2878001 the challenges presented by population growth an aging population migration patterns and urban and coastal development will be compounded by changes in temperature precipitation and extreme climate related events climate change will affect where people choose to live work and play among likely climate changes are changes in the intensity and frequency of precipitation more frequent heat waves less frequent cold waves more persistent and extreme drought conditions and associated water shortages changes in minimum and maximum temperatures potential increases in the intensity and frequency of extreme tropical storms measurable sea level rise and increases in the occurrence of coastal and riverine flooding in response to these anticipated changes the united states may develop and deploy strategies for mitigating greenhouse gases and for adapting to unavoidable individual and collective impacts of climate change

2878012 too many residents said this group is just harassing any animal they can lay their hands on
2878013 our call centres just been flooded people are saying enoughs enough
2878014 they were basically going there to witness what it was like on the ground in beijing to use the olympics to legitimize their rule over tibet and to whitewash their human rights record
2878015 their intention was to go and see how the chinese government are using the games and their assumptions were confirmed
2878016 we want to send a clear message that the truth has to be exposed
2878017 the true reality behind the hosting of these olympic games the stories that are not being told because of the security and the control of the media
2878018 weve been in contact with all of them and they are well

2878022 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2878023 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2878024 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2878025 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2878026 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2878027 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2878028 its kind of disappointing when you talk it up and talk it up and then nothing happens
2878029 the houston area got most of the rain today two to four inches
2878030 with instability caused by the low pressure we could still see a 50 percent chance of rainfall throughout the day
2878031 he never sold a painting thats why he killed himself
2878032 if you consider something holy you will not violate it and you will not betray it
2878033 well if books like that are out there i dont want to live
2878034 if it had been somebody there to shoot her every minute of her life
2878035 her talent for fiction is so great as to be almost overwhelming
2878036 the author lives in milledgeville georgia where she raises peacocks
2878037 the guilt of outliving those you love is justly to be borne she thought outliving is something we do to them
2878038 oh is there anything you want to tell me is there anything i can do for you
2878039 i want you to write exactly the book youve always wanted to write and i want you to be as smart as you feel like being
2878040 asid berlebihan dalam cecair badan memberi ruang kepada penyakit begitu juga lemak

2878044 now we can clearly see the health disparities that exist in our community
2878045 the game against the swedes will be a classic between the tactics and organisation of the swedes and our hard running and direct game
2878046 how does believing that reflect christ or anything that christ taught
2878047 is this something i enjoy or is this just something i do regularly
2878048 i was raised to think of movies as something you did after work not before
2878049 wait i think s wanted to see the movie too
2878050 well tell him to get up we have a bus to catch
2878051 wherere ya headed ill give you a lift to the transit center
2878052 and he said i need to get off the stage and go back over here
2878053 a kid comes up and says he wants to play with you
2878054 and you tell him to go sit down whats wrong with you
2878055 and heres a kid who asks if he can hang out with you and you send him away thats not right
2878056 but thats where i buy nearly all of my christian books
2878057 okay i gotta squeeze some time out today tomorrow and saturday to write a sermon
2878058 you keep saying youre not a preacher youre a teacher so do what i made you able to do
2878059 i think theyre worried about nothing the holy spirit can reach anyone in fact they make a lot of general statements that i really dont think are accurate postmoderns arent quite as monolithic as they make them out to be
2878060 and actually sing faster not just higher and pretending its faster
2878061 if they can keep themselves from giggling theyll hear the following lyrics
2878062 how many of us have participated in team sports in high school or college
2878063 well you never referred to me by name so off to hell with you
2878064 you dont believe humans are capable of destroying the earth
2878065 are you talking about the species of whom god said if they can pull
2878066 he meant for us to do great things through his power but when we put our minds to it we can do things through our own power like build a tower that hes really not pleased about or like pollute a planet that hes told us to care for
2878067 that sounds an awful lot like the idea that the earth is a living being are you sure you havent fallen for the earth worshippers propaganda
2878068 and youre figuring that if we pollute the earth like crazy god will fix the pollution before it destroys the planet
2878069 how big does the pollution have to get before god fixes it im thinking of chernobyl frinstance theres a whole lot of irradiated ukraine thanks to that disaster
2878070 yeah but there couldve been so much more pollution if god hadnt stepped in remember how the scientists were talking about a big toxic cloud that would destroy europe god stopped that from happening
2878071 out of curiosity do you figure god fixes other instances of human irresponsibility so that it doesnt result in untold human suffering inadequate levees for example
2878072 we really wanted the elections postponed because it could delay the implementation of any agreement that would be reached if the two sides conclude a deal by november 2009
2878073 unless we get a full blown war over there then thats the only time it might significantly affect
2878074 it seems that we are having a good election and the people our brothers and sisters in the south are showing us the way
2878075 is consistent with the moderation in economic growth seen in the second quarter
2878076 gdp growth in the second half is likely to be broadly similar to the first half
2878077 weaker demand in the major economies coupled with the need to contain inflationary pressures will dampen growth in the fast growing asian economies
2878078 the lower growth in the second quarter was mainly the result of a sharp contraction in biomedical manufacturing value added
2878079 stagnant growth in the electronics industry also contributed to the slowdown in gdp growth
2878080 mr and mrs bronstein cordially invite you to the wedding of their daughter judith which they have paid for out of their own pockets
2878081 dont worry about bringing food weve paid for the food out of our own pockets
2878082 if you notice that certain corners have been cut in the food or decorations its because we dont know a damn thing about how to throw a party on a budget and weve pissed away the bulk of it on renting unnecessary space and musicians and caterers and furniture and party favors and we actually put down deposits on some things so please dont trash the place like you did those hotel rooms when we went to disneyland grad night
2878083 man is that shirt really 17 years old it looks it
2878084 i wanted to go 1 45 and if it werent for that messed up finish i would have done it

2878087 i just feel like thats not the last youre going to see of me im going to bring it back and i wont be done until i at least have a legitimate shot at those world records again
2878088 youve got to tip your hat to somebody that does something like that in a pressure packed race like that thats a hell of a swim and he is a true champion
2878089 i just got to go home and take care of myself its going to be a tight final natalies just so good at racing and planning out her races so i just expect nothing but fast fast swimming tomorrow morning
2878090 its exactly where i wanted to be going into the finals im happy with that i just need to recover and focus on my final
2878091 beautiful boards blah blah blah too pretty to ride blah blah blah to me it was frustrating to hear the same thing from 99 963 of the people i make them to ride
2878092 i see the visual appearance as the third reason to have one a distant third at that the second reason to have one would be the ride quality of a hollow wood board the feelings that foam cant offer resonant etc
2878093 as far as an organization trying to rebuild around young guys thats important
2878094 a lot of guys i know who were drafted its five or six deep at their positions im not saying im ahead of anybody in this organization but theres a good chance to speed up the process in the situation im in who knows what would have happened if i had been drafted by another organization im fortunate to be where i am and happy to be where i am
2878095 its not for sure hes signed yet as far as im concerned were not teammates yet at the time we were both trying to win for our schools if i had a chance to go back i probably would have said something to him
2878096 his emotions were running high it wasnt overboard compared to other guys you see
2878097 yes i was definitely excited to strike manny ramirez out
2878098 hes one of the greatest hitters in the game im young thats probably not going to happen again but im not saying it might not happen sometime in a big game in a different situation
2878099 i was milton bradleys love child parts one and two
2878100 you know we all have busy lives were just so very very busy
2878101 and some of us really take no time to just sit down relax and talk to god so im gonna give you the opportunity lets each of us go off in a corner of the room get comfortable and just take this time to talk to god
2878102 i know you all are tired from the long week so take this time to lie down and take a nap for 30 minutes
2878103 we never made any donations sir i have no idea what you are talking about
2878104 i remember many a long weekend trying to look up information about donors on the internet
2878105 john mccain puts the ethics bar higher than anyone in national politics
2878106 hes very dedicated and exhibited a high degree of integrity
2878107 i am proud to be a child of an army officer and happy that the armed forces are doing so well in the field of organ donations
2878108 i know the value of organ donation as my father at one point was deeply in need of one as conscious individuals we should all pledge to donate our organs
2878109 if we cannot live as good human beings we can be nice at least after our death life is beautiful and lets live longer by donating organs
2878110 it was still pretty easy to spin the tires out there and we werent really sure what the track would hold so we waited to watch a few pairs of funny cars run ahead of us
2878111 just about everyone had spun during the opening session but we were able to get down there far enough to be the fifth quickest and that was important for the later run because it put us further back in line
2878112 when ashely force ran 4 11 in the same lane we were going to be in we went with the more aggressive option and that turned out to be a really big call on the part of my dad and me it got us solidly up in the top half earned us some big qualifying points and really ended up helping us out a ton in u s smokeless showdown points which we havent even been paying attention to that much you get zero showdown points when you dnq and weve done that four times this year so we all just kind of put that whole deal out of our minds right now were right there in it
2878113 as a matter of fact i thought the news was false but thats what the numbers are and its pretty amazing basically if we go to reading and out qualify scelzi and beckman were in that seems impossible after all weve gone through but weve qualified in the top half at five of the last six races and we really made up a lot of distance in a hurry ill take it because we need some good news around here
2878114 its a crushing blow because its on me and we had it right there in our hands to make a strong move for the countdown
2878115 its not over yet and we still have two more races to go before the 10 countdown spots are filled but im the guy in the car and that was the best i had right then
2878116 the way this all set up with us having to race tasca in the first round made the drama just about as thick as it can get it was so tense in the pit hardly anyone was talking but we felt really good about the car and really good about the tune up it ran just about flawlessly and our 4 25 was right there with just about all the best runs in the round we just didnt get there first like i said i dont have an easy answer because i did the best i could and it wasnt enough it hurts in a lot of ways but were not folding up and quitting were going straight to reading to win that race
2878117 its unfortunate that todd got ill but we did get expert help from rockstar energy drink dodge crew chief phil shuler and the armys alan johnson but it wasnt to be today
2878118 its been a tough season for the mopar oakley dodge team and when you put yourself in a position to having only three races to get into the countdown it makes it tough to get there
2878119 it is too bad because this car is a lot better than this although we havent shown it its very disappointing
2878120 all we can do is hope to win the next two races to try to squeak into the top 10 if not well just be a headache to the others in the countdown to 1 playoffs rounds
2878121 just when you think im not that sore anymore well throw something else in there
2878122 buddy im fitting into two suits i havent fit into in more than a year

2878125 unfortunately there are no facilities for pd in pakistan and the randomly collected data reveals that there are around one million patients in the country
2878126 of these patients around 400 000 to 450 000 are being treated by family doctors
2878127 however the cause for this change is still not known
2878128 we have been found efficient effective and hardworking more than permanent teachers and our performance has been acknowledged by maqsoodul hassan a former director general of the federal directorate of education
2878129 we had been promised that our job will be regularised with the passage of time but it has not been done yet
2878130 the punjab government has regularised 7 000 english teachers who were contracted in 1995 and has given them other benefits
2878131 we have been in depression because the federal government has been ignoring us our salary has been fixed at rs 10 000 over the last three years while prices of commodities have multiplied in this time contract has been hanging over us like sword of damocles

2878138 maestros hay actualmente para quienes no puede faltar unas palabra o una demostraci n de gratitud es verdad que han servido muchos a os pero pobres maestros para ellos han pasado desapercibidas mucha cosas
2878139 los nuevos m todos de ense anza los textos tiles modernos cuadros ilustrativos mapas y diversos objetos de aplicaci n adaptados a las nuevas pr cticas escolares
2878140 han penetrado hoy hasta en las m s apartadas escuelas de la provincia
2878141 no lo han visto estos maestros que viven a n estacionados e indiferentes a los progresos did cticos sin darse cuenta de su misi n
2878142 no pueden permanecer por m s tiempo dirigiendo las escuelas de la provincia sin causar grandes atrasos a la ense anza pues no tan solo no saben transmitirla porque no conocen ni los m s elementales principios de pedagog a sino que ignoran completamente las mismas materias de instrucci n de los actuales planes de estudio
2878143 aprendieron a leer mal por m todos que est n desechados hoy d a y en sus largos a os de servicios no han tenido tiempo de corregir ni sus errores de ortograf a esto es todo lo que saben y es tambi n toda la instrucci n que pueden suministrar
2878144 la sobreasignaci n por responsabilidad funcional no debe confundirse con el adicional por extensi n horaria
2878145 la ordenanza municipal 757 82 establece que los jueces del tribunal de faltas no pueden cobrar menos que los directores de repartici n pero se desoy esa norma y ahora la corte nos da la raz n
2878146 la sobreasignaci n por responsabilidad funcional no debe confundirse con el adicional por extensi n horaria

2878170 we cant say whether games like grand theft auto encourage aggression whether aggressive kids like gta or if other factors affect both of these

2878183 wed hoped that was the beginning of an opening in the democratic space
2878184 but the political space is contracting again its clear the ruling party is determined to stay in power by any means
2878185 i dont think the political space is in any way being constrained
2878186 they dont claim they want a socialist state but the ideology is still there
2878187 the international community espouses ideas about good governance transparency and human rights but then they help a regime that flouts and violates those fundamental rights
2878188 i dont think the american people or the congress are going to accept decreasing food when there are photographs from ethiopia of starving children

2878198 the majority race is not as good at identifying minorities as it is its own race this is hard wired in some way that we dont completely understand but the phenomenon should be presented to the jury

2878255 ons is nog nie baie seker wat gebeur het nie maar die vrou het vertel dat sy omstreeks 23 00 n skoot gehoor het
2878256 sy het by die venster uitgekyk maar niks gesien nie
2878257 masset het by die huis waar sy vrou was ingestruikel en vir sy vrou die naam ges van wie moontlik die verdagte kan wees
2878258 ons het net ingetrek toe vlieg di drie gewapende mans agter die mure uit

2878272 my goal is to walk unaided but that is up to how hard i am willing to work and if luck is on my side
2878273 but i know that i will be disabled for the rest of my life it is not something i will ever fully recover from
2878274 he fingered where my bullet wound was and then told me to get up he had a gun in my face i said i couldnt move
2878275 luckily for me i was a dead weight he only managed to get them to my knees he then put his gun in between my legs and kept repeating that he was going to f me and then kill me

2878284 he came to ask my son cobus to go into the house with him because he was scared there was someone in the house when we came into the house we looked everywhere for antoinette
2878285 in the bedroom we just saw a bunch of duvets lying there i was just feeling under the duvets when i felt a cold foot
2878286 they smashed her head to a pulp with a blunt object
2878287 he said the child had to stay with us for the night because antoinette was going to work night shift

2878297 if you are a minister what are you afraid of its just a superiority complex that they have its terrible all ministers should send a circular telling their people to stop this
2878298 these people who ride bikes dont you think by slapping a policeman they are asking for trouble from the police
2878299 there are certain types of south africans with an attitude that needs to change that attitude maybe has to do with the skin colour of the drivers these people who are complaining must accept that it is darkies in those cars and it will be so for a long time to come
2878300 if you find anyone abusing the system report them to us we will institute proper disciplinary action
2878301 i dont watch the speed i read my papers and drink my coffee in the car
2878302 the law says if a policeman is driving regardless of speed they have a right to switch on the blue light if they want to pass any policeman as soon as he steps into a government vehicle if he likes can switch it on
2878303 the act is very clear you may only use a blue light and exceed the speed limit if it is safe and under due consideration of other road users you cant speed you cant jump traffic lights if its not safe to do so due regard has to be paid to other road users
2878304 the ministers of transport and justice really need to sit down and take action
2878305 there to serve not to show off their conduct needs to be investigated because these are not isolated cases and you would expect the premier to condemn something like this
2878306 we as the psam encourage people on the receiving end of such incidents to report them to the police or independent complaints directorate if no action is taken they should involve the public protector
2878307 it is an abuse of power and we will investigate any reported accidents you dont just put it on because you woke up late and your child is late for school
2878308 i followed them to a service station in empangeni where they filled up for fuel and didnt seem to me to be in a hurry i confronted the black clad sunglassed firearmed driver of one of the vehicles and asked him where he had got his drivers licence he was more concerned about my swearing than the danger he was on the road
2878309 its quite strange it seems as though the hijackers knew that mr hector would be taken to louis leipoldt the closest emergency hospital and that they decided to leave the car there because they were only interested in the money
2878310 some of the children are traumatised they saw the man lying there some kids walked around him gave him a wide berth i saw some kids closing their eyes as they walked past
2878311 we have opened a case of attempted murder for investigation
2878312 die geknetter van die vlamme en die reuk van die rook sal ek nooit vergeet nie ek het paniekbevange aan die kattebak geskop en gebid asseblief here help my dat ek nie vandag hier doodbrand nie met n wonderwerk kry ek dit toe oop
2878313 oomblikke later het ek die geknetter van vlamme gehoor ek het paniekbevange besef hulle het die motor aan die brand gesteek
2878314 but before they could alight from the car they were shot
2878315 the second woman was shot in the pelvis and is in a serious condition at a hospital
2878316 ek het opgespring my vuurwapen gegryp en na die voordeur gehardloop die eerste rower het in die halfoop deur gestaan en skreeu hy is van die polisie en toe begin die ou agter hom skiet
2878317 ek het teruggeskiet en die eerste ou in die kop geskiet ek het n tweede ou in die bors geskiet en nog n ander rower iewers op die lyf
2878318 ek is amper seker hulle het koe lvaste baadjies aangehad want daar was geen bloedspoor op ons erf of buite nie ek weet egter vir n feit ek het hulle ook raakgeskiet
2878319 die aand van die aanval het die rowers in dieselfde twee voertuie gevlug
2878320 die volgende oomblik het n gewapende rower uit die donker verskyn
2878321 ek kon sien hy was nou nie juis n professionele rower nie want hy was baie onhandig met die pistool
2878322 die rower het ges i demand money toe s hy ek moet op die grond gaan l ek het op hom geskreeu ek kan nie op die grond l n vir hom geld gaan haal nie
2878323 ek was woedend maar ons kon daarin slaag om hom plat te slaan en te oorrompel wat kommerwekkend is is dat my huis baie veilig is daar is veiligheidsheinings reg rondom die erf
2878324 rasta told me that no one would be home i broke a window and went into the house i took a television set outside and went inside again
2878325 i took a knife from the kitchen and went into a bedroom while i was trying to open a wardrobe i heard movement and when i turned i saw a white person behind me
2878326 i was shocked as rasta had told me no one was there i was scared and i stabbed him several times and he fell i could feel he was still breathing
2878327 i felt sorry for injuring him and put him on his bed and i went out and took the television set
2878328 he spoke all over the world and was extremely passionate and incredibly optimistic
2878329 he lived in a world of great dreams if one fell over hed get another one in place
2878330 the car behind me was hooting and flashing lights indicating i should move to another lane it was not possible to change lanes at the time but these people seemed to feel i was in their way
2878331 they came up to me and asked how come you drive like that i said but what have i done wrong
2878332 they started swearing at me before punching me twice in the face through the drivers side window
2878333 on saturday the doctor told me i had come close to being concussed my head is still sore im still not 100 percent
2878334 how much longer are these people going to be allowed to terrorise ordinary drivers somebody will get killed by this

2878338 hoe kon dit n rassistiese moord gewees het jaco kon nie agter n toe deur sien watter kleur die rowers is nie al wat hy geweet het is dat hulle besig was om in sy kamer te probeer inkom en hom dan beslis sou aanval
2878339 n onskuldige persoon het hom uit noodweer verdedig uit vrees dat hy sou sterf
2878340 ons is nie rassiste nie jaco het uitstekende verhoudings met sy werkers sy huishulp het in trane uitgebars toe sy die oggend by die huis aankom en sien wat gebeur het
2878341 i dont want to mess the youngsters brians career up

2878352 hulle het die serp wat ek die dag aangehad het oor my mond vasgebind
2878353 hulle het hul klere uitgetrek en in my dogter se kamer gelos ek het van hul tekkies tussen my onderklere gekry
2878354 die aanvallers het ook sy suurstofpype uitgeruk en hom vir die dood gelos

2878457 the county has been raping the taxpayers with contracts and bond fees and attorney fees and its not going to change until we change who we elect
2878458 as republicans we struggled with this decision but felt it was the right thing to do
2878459 this is not the burlington county republican party that many of us so strongly supported for many years these candidates are not like sen diane allen freeholder bill haines or sheriff jean stanfield people with strong moral character who champion fiscal conservatism and represent real republican values

2878474 were finding clear evidence that working on country has benefits for the health of aboriginal people and for the nation
2878475 the health benefits in terms of reducing levels of high blood pressure diabetes and kidney disease are quite striking when people are actively engaged in looking after their country
2878476 aboriginal elders and leaders set up these small settlements because it was important to their wellbeing and health
2878477 if you move people away from their land in an attempt to deliver better health and other services paradoxically you may sever the link that gives them both physical and psychological health
2878478 the health impacts derive partly from improved diet and fitness but are also due to the psychological and social effects of caring for country she explains
2878479 but they also mean people live longer lives in which they can contribute to their society grandparents for example can look after the kids longer or people can work for longer and generate more economic activity

2878492 are democrats really prepared to close the government in order to stop drilling
2878493 i think the american people would find that a suicidal strategy
2878494 so republicans are going to tell seniors youre being squeezed by high gas prices and high grocery prices and now were going to cut off your social security checks
2878495 said jennifer crider a spokeswoman for the democratic congressional campaign committee the house democrats campaign arm
2878496 as far as im concerned those bans end sept 30 and if they end on sept 30 fuel prices will head back down on oct 1
2878497 i want to see the most forward looking energy policy for alternatives
2878498 if in order to get that you have to compromise and have the states sign off on whether they want drilling or not maybe thats the price we are going to pay to get it but to have an up or down vote on drilling where does that leave us it leaves us in the same place republicans have put us in after eight years of their policies

2878516 usually i listen to what theyre saying because theyre already emotional to begin with

2878520 theres nothing better than this when i started playing with wexford before we were struggling in the bottom of division 4 against no disrespect teams like waterford and tipperary weve come so far so who knows whats going to happen the next day we have surpassed the expectations of everyone but ourselves
2878521 they came up the field on numerous occasions in the first half and we contained them and from the outside everything looked relatively comfortable then the long diagonal ball across the face of the square and the ball is in the back of the net and then all of a sudden for want of another way of putting it the backside fell out of us
2878522 its like starving a child and then expecting that child to grow into an olympian athlete

2878525 the rainfall was completely freakish it was of monsoon proportions even met eireann couldnt forecast the particular weather front coming in until sometime on saturday morning which was very late
2878526 people would be ringing up saying their houses are flooded and there was water on the roads people were trapped in cars and they needed to be rescued
2878527 this was an unprecedented and extreme weather event and it is great to hear that serious injury and fatality have been avoided
2878528 in the first 20 minutes of each half cork certainly asked a lot of questions about us but we weathered the storm and finished both halves strongly
2878529 there was no way that we or any side can dominate a game for 70 minutes or for one half
2878530 we took our foot off the pedal around the 22th minute of the first half and never really got to grips with the game after that
2878531 there was some hope when we reduced kilkennys lead to five points in the second half but the goal that we needed never materialised
2878532 the scores that were got in the second half by both teams is just a testimony to the players out there we dont talk about the players that we have playing our games we dont appreciate enough what players have to go through in those kind of conditions

2878561 daley is too young to go for the really big big dives as his body is not yet up to it
2878562 that means in the individual competition when it comes to later dives his older rivals can pull out a really big dives with a high tariff and daley can only hope they mess it up
2878563 but in the synchro it is easier for him and blake to match them
2878564 i watched the diving practice with a bunch of chinese volunteers while i watched the world and olympic champion guo jingjing going through her paces they watched tom daley sitting in a chair
2878565 thats when i realised how big tom daley is in china and the competition hasnt even begun
2878566 hes very handsome one teenager told me kind great talented were some of the other descriptions from youngsters scrabbling for an autograph
2878567 in china diving is a quite big sport so like walking around the streets you do sometimes get recognised in the village as well some of the chinese staff and at the diving pool as well some of a few people recognise you a bit
2878568 its kind of weird because when youre little and you always dream of being that person up there more famous and it is kind of weird to start getting that being recognised and it is really weird as you dont expect it to happen
2878569 going to an olympics at that age was good because it meant i bought the teeshirt got the cd so by the time moscow came around four years later i was not so over awed

2878583 mccain saw us excused himself and we three went to the senate dining room for lunch
2878584 during lunch mccain said almost with mischievous glee that he had slipped some highly technical questions to james mcclure to ask mofford questions she wouldnt be prepared to answer or expected to answer
2878585 flabbergasted i asked mccain why would he want to sabotage moffords testimony when in fact the cap was the nonpartisan pet of republicans and democrats such as far left udall and far right goldwater since its inception
2878586 his reply as near as i remember was ill embarrass a democrat any time i get the chance
2878587 ive known cindy since she was a little girl and the hensleys have always been very good to me
2878588 that hurt me more than anything to be set up like that
2878589 he orchestrated a partisan mean spirited and utterly inexcusable hearing designed to embarrass governor mofford by unfairly pressing her only a week into her new job for minute details on the central arizona project which was the most sacrosanct of all issues critical to arizona
2878590 i know that there was quite a little conversation with my staff i know we did ask mofford a number of questions because somebody had told us that she was not well grounded in some of the issues and it was designed to expose her lack of information
2878591 im not saying he wasnt but i just dont remember
2878592 he said i didnt have anything to do with that
2878593 the one about the woman who is attacked on the street by a gorilla beaten senseless raped repeatedly and left to die
2878594 when she finally regains consciousness and tries to speak her doctor leans over to hear her sigh contently and to feebly ask
2878595 you can attribute that to me and hell kill me for it
2878596 he traces his environmental awareness to the sainted rep mo udall an arizona democrat who took mccain as a young congressman under his tutelage to environmentalists thats like saying you learned about civil rights by driving around alabama with martin luther king jr
2878597 mccain was i have to say at the time sympathetic with what we were trying to do but he never came forward and offered any solutions
2878598 soon found he had to stop mccain from using his good name
2878599 you will recall during my speech at the dinner for the president in phoenix i announced that you were going to give half of the funds you raised to the state republican party i am told by the party that you still owe them 35 000 and unless you pay all of it or most of it they cannot meet their payroll next wednesday
2878600 that was devastating to me that he brought in a reporter i thought that was crossing the line and it destroyed me
2878601 i was wearing pepe jeans the day i came to new times so you could interview me for the cindy mccain story
2878602 if a person knows that prescriptions have been written in their name and they never met with the doctor and they dont know the whereabouts of the drugs what is their responsibility and i was told it was my responsibility to turn it in so at that moment i began to cooperate with the dea
2878603 july 27 1992 i have always wondered why john mccain has done nothing to fix the problem
2878604 the aforementioned matters are of great concern to those directly involved but my main concern is the ability of avmt to survive a major shake up
2878605 during my short tenure at avmt i have been surrounded by what on the surface appears to be the ultimate all american family in reality i am working for a very sad lonely woman whose marriage of convenience to a u s senator has driven her to distance herself from friends cover feelings of despair with drugs and replace lonely moments with self indulgences
2878606 he always had his own views of how a newspaper ought to be run and he didnt like the way we ran it
2878607 its a free world so hes welcome to feel that way
2878608 we used to sit in the outer office and listen to him
2878609 others were much more discreet about it for instance jon kyl if he had an issue would call and discuss it and it would be fine
2878610 hed tell editorial boards how awful his hometown paper was
2878611 so id hear from my colleagues around the country that was always fun
2878612 hes a united states senator and you ought to have respect for a united states senator
2878613 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2878614 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2878615 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2878616 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2878617 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2878618 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2878619 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2878620 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2878621 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2878622 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2878623 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2878624 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2878625 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2878626 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2878627 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2878628 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2878629 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2878630 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2878631 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2878632 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2878633 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2878634 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2878635 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2878636 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2878637 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2878638 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2878639 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2878640 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2878641 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2878642 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2878643 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2878644 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2878645 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2878646 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2878647 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2878648 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2878649 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2878650 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2878651 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2878652 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2878653 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years

2878655 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2878656 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2878657 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2878658 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2878659 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2878660 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2878661 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2878662 who are open to doing something on the production side
2878663 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2878664 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2878665 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2878666 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2878667 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2878668 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2878669 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2878670 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2878671 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2878672 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2878673 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2878674 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2878675 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2878676 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2878677 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2878678 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2878679 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2878680 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2878681 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2878682 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2878683 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2878684 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2878685 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2878686 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2878687 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2878688 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2878689 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2878690 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2878691 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2878692 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2878693 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2878694 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2878695 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2878696 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2878697 i want to direct all kinds of films my next directorial venture would be what subject excites me
2878698 a big star associated with the film can manage to draw audiences for first three days in the second week onwards it is the film which matters
2878699 it was not a trade mark masala entertainer will you call taare zameen par an art film it did commercial business of rs 131 crore
2878700 there are several films with huge stars that have crashed at the box office
2878701 it is a very dramatic film which values human life justice for wrongdoings is necessary otherwise how can we move forward as a society
2878702 it is important that we accept it ensure justice and move forward
2878703 it is important not only to respect life but sensitise the society so that there is a positive impact the film amu does precisely that
2878704 healing process is important how can we move ahead as a society if we do not tend to the injuries of our fellow travellers
2878705 but the censors deleted five lines pertaining to a political party and the film was given an a certificate i was asked why the young generation should see a film on an issue which is buried and long forgotten the 1984 riots are not forgotten and the film was made out of my personal experiences as i actively worked in relief camps in delhi during that period

2878730 we have seen steady and material deceleration in googs organic revenue growth
2878731 hmmm thats a good question let me think about that for a second
2878732 im not really sure im going to have to think about that for a bit and get back to you
2878733 im not sure to be honest what do you think
2878734 ive never really considered that perhaps you can expand the question a little and we can explore it right now
2878735 im not sure how we would deal with a sudden spike in the cost of bandwidth we would have to collect more information and answer that question down the road
2878736 looking forward to seeing you tomorrow at your offices at 123 main street at 3pm if anything changes you can reach me on my mobile at 310 555 1212

2878765 why are they pitching him after only one rehab start in louisville have they looked at the standings do they want to ruin the guy bad idea
2878766 but everything i threw right over the middle of the plate they were sitting on my slider especially the first inning everything they hit was a slider
2878767 i wasnt getting good depth on the slider and it definitely wasnt the way i wanted to come back
2878768 it has been a bad home series for us all 1 6 including houstons four game sweep we have some soul searching to do and figure some things out
2878769 we helped a lot of batting average the last four games because every time i looked up they had double digits in hits
2878770 the problem i saw when i got here is that we had a dozen or so eligible free agents
2878771 when the season gets late if you are in the hunt through october then it can be a motivator if you are not in the hunt you see a lot more i have to look out for myself type of thing
2878772 i didnt say im seeing it here but ive seen it happen human nature makes sense
2878773 when you are 18 games out its tough to say im going to get that runner over from second to third with nobody out by giving myself up it is a lot easier when you are winning at this time of year
2878774 winning takes care of a lot of stuff including my sleep pattern
2878775 the next six weeks count a lot were looking at who still wants to win right now thats big if you want to win right now under these circumstances then how much better are you going to be in better circumstances
2878776 its like a broken record us getting behind early in every game
2878777 some weekend four losses to houston some week 1 6 on the homestand it wasnt just a bad game sunday it was a bad week
2878778 i like ross he did a good job for us i have nothing to say bad about him we had him on trade waivers and nobody claimed him
2878779 right now were not heading north and lately weve been headed south
2878780 there are things we have to find out about other guys hanigan has a chance to be in our future and we need to learn if he can be a regular or if he can be a no 2 next year
2878781 i was having fun playing at louisville its an honor to be up here but louisville was winning games and it was a fun team to be on now i shift gears try to learn the pitchers see how things go
2878782 i just try to put good swings on the ball im a catcher and im here for the pitchers but hopefully i can add some offense too
2878783 its not the big leagues but honestly im looking forward to it they are seven or eight games up and in a playoff race when i was down there before the guys were winning and there is good morale
2878784 his last outing was his best since ive been here
2878785 my advice to him was win and improve then come back here and continue to improve im big on showing improvement and if you do that youre showing me you have the ability to learn retain and apply what you learn
2878786 ive worked hard for this and ill take it for what it is take it for the experience ill get
2878787 definitely an honor ill do my best to learn and improve my game by being here
2878788 oh iya besok kamu ulang tahun ya kita pergi ke ancol ya jalan jalan disana kita pulang yuk sudah malam nih

2878794 mike there seems to be some hesitation about accepting the offer what up
2878795 mike you said you wanted a position with more responsibility related to project management this position will definitely stretch your responsibilities from day one yet i hear some hesitancy as you talk about the position under what circumstances if any would you accept the position if offered
2878796 mike there seems to be some hesitation about accepting the offer what up

2878803 you dont have the base of information to make intelligent decisions
2878804 on the plan ride over i was kind of thumbing through it looking through it just trying to remember it
2878805 one thing we have to get straight is this chad thing
2878806 were going to have to call him rook or call me c p or something
2878807 i dont know he looks a little thin he needs to eat some chicken wings or something
2878808 hes cool though ive played against him so many times he owes me some money though because i get all those personal fouls against him every year so i might take his shoes or something and maybe hell give me a ransom
2878809 its going to be a lot of fun im looking forward to it i really do
2878810 i dont have revenge on my mind or anything like that i have one thing on my mind and thats a victory period
2878811 ive been there before i know what its all about i think it brings out the best in all of us and i think it makes our team better so im no stranger to that i welcome the challenge and i look forward to it
2878812 the same stressors that are preprogramming the fetus to be heavier when born may also be programming the fetus to develop rheumatoid arthritis later in life
2878813 i love the way she is full of power and she is unapologetic about it
2878814 i love how funny she is and yet she is so clueless about her own emotionality she is so intuitive about other people but she doesnt have a clue about herself
2878815 shes a fascinating woman as an actress to step into for someone like me who always wants to talk about other peoples feelings she is totally not like that she has no interest in it for herself
2878816 its hard to find roles like that if youre a woman there arent a lot of good writers out there and there are a lot who dont know anything about writing for a woman
2878817 its like a marriage in that i literally give myself up to this character six months out of every year and it literally takes up every single fiber of my being for six months
2878818 i steal an occasional moment to be with my family but for the most part it is a total takeover its a total mind takeover i have to memorize the lines but i also give myself over to the character six months out of the year
2878819 there are a million things i am powerless over i feel that way every day
2878820 i am powerless over what people think of me i dont think any actress thinks they care what other people think if they do why become an actress
2878821 yes im the first quadriplegic to serve in house but i certainly wont be the last
2878822 im excited for the people after me it shows once again that people with disabilities can lead and serve just like anybody else
2878823 our commitment to a barrier free workplace sends an invaluable message to all americans that the house will lead by example
2878824 hopefully this will be an inspiration to people with disabilities not only in rhode island but across america
2878825 i hope others with disabilities will continue to dream and hope to serve theres no reason that they cant
2878826 there is certainly no peace for those people because they know they are being looked for theres no peace for their family its not only a rotten life for them its a rotten life for their families
2878827 if you wait two years after the crime to put someone on the list i think its harder to catch that person
2878828 theyve gotten farther away and the outrage over the crime has died down
2878829 we grow up being pretty connected in our world now electronically and socially
2878830 its hard to disconnect those guys that do that are truly hard to find
2878831 more times than not when they are riding back with me they say they are just glad it is over
2878832 however we have seen in the past that when this soil sits for a while it disperses we intend to fill an oven with this material either by additional vibration of the same screen or by opening doors to one of the other tega cells
2878833 every sample has one illicit drug or another regardless of location
2878834 you may see differences from place to place but theres always something
2878835 i am very pleased that we were able to identify the ice as actually being frozen water
2878836 im also looking forward to other discoveries that we might make in the surface materials of mars
2878837 a disgrace to the general assembly and the republican party
2878838 the best argument against democracy is a five minute conversation with the average voter
2878839 democracy is the worst form of government except all the others that have been tried
2878840 its a bit of an art learning how to drive across dry lake beds at great speed
2878841 the good thing about having it attached to the truck is that if you miss the dust devil you can quickly pick up the instruments and chase it down again
2878842 but chasing just gives you more information about dust devils
2878843 the big thing about this project is were not just going in and measuring dust devils
2878844 we want to be measuring the ambient meteorology at the same time so having two different test areas gives us two different climatic regions to study
2878845 i really like going into the field and chasing dust devils
2878846 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal
2878847 i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2878848 we are overjoyed that our duracut bit helped to simplify the soil extraction process
2878849 we knew our rotozip bits were able to perform under harsh conditions but never imagined that something right off hardware shelves would also penetrate the surface of mars
2878850 we now better understand the process of planet formation and can explain the properties of the strange exoplanets weve observed
2878851 we also know that the solar system is special and understand at some level what makes it special the solar system had to be born under just the right conditions to become this quiet place we see the vast majority of other planetary systems didnt have these special properties at birth and became something very different
2878852 gas disks to gas giants simulating the birth of planetary systems
2878853 but we now know that these other planetary systems dont look like the solar system at all
2878854 the shapes of the exoplanets orbits are elongated not nice and circular planets are not where we expect them to be many giant planets similar to jupiter known as hot jupiters are so close to the star they have orbits of mere days clearly we needed to start fresh in explaining planetary formation and this greater variety of planets we now see
2878855 such a turbulent history would seem to leave little room for the sedate solar system and our simulations show exactly that
2878856 conditions must be just right for the solar system to emerge
2878857 we now better understand the process of planet formation and can explain the properties of the strange exoplanets weve observed
2878858 we also know that the solar system is special and understand at some level what makes it special
2878859 the solar system had to be born under just the right conditions to become this quiet place we see the vast majority of other planetary systems didnt have these special properties at birth and became something very different
2878860 an essential element of the implementation of nasa missions is the dissemination of collected data to the science community at large
2878861 this delivery while not the first for the messenger mission represents a significant milestone
2878862 we had delivered data from messenger to the pds before but not mercury data
2878863 this delivery was particularly significant the first messenger flyby of mercury was mankinds return to this planet after an absence of over three decades in this one flyby we imaged previously unseen areas of mercurys surface greatly improved the resolution in areas already covered and made observations of a kind that had never been made before
2878864 the science results from these instruments have already shed light on questions about mercury that have lingered for more than three decades
2878865 the availability of these data via pds will allow scientists around the world to study the data and begin making even more connections and discoveries
2878866 an essential element of the implementation of nasa missions is the dissemination of collected data to the science community at large
2878867 its critical to maintain a planetary data archive that will withstand the test of time so that future generations of scientists can access understand and use pre existing planetary data
2878868 the pds validation process needs to be comprehensive and unforgiving to ensure that only high quality well documented data are released for use by the science community
2878869 the data archives do not need to be perfect but they do need to be documented well enough that future users unfamiliar with how the data were acquired can understand the data and apply them to new problems
2878870 the tool now includes actual unprocessed images from the narrow angle and wide angle cameras taken during the january flyby
2878871 viewers will see the same images that told the team that the cameras were not only on target but were revealing mercury as it had never been seen before
2878872 its a unique opportunity to project high resolution nasa data for educational purposes
2878873 many members of the messenger team devoted long hours and weekends to ensure that the project met the goal of releasing all of our mercury data six months after the flyby we are delighted to share these historic data with the scientific community and the public and we hope that their availability will foster interest everywhere in the mysteries of the suns closest planetary neighbor
2878874 plays a key role in understanding how electronics work how all sorts of interesting materials behave how light behaves during communication by optical fibers
2878875 when you look at all the technology governed by quantum physics its not unreasonable to assume that if one can apply chaos theory in a meaningful way to quantum systems that will provide new insights new technology new solutions to problems not yet known
2878876 this type of common behavior has been a signature of classically chaotic newtonian systems mostly studied using a computer but it never had been observed in an experimental system that only can be described by quantum mechanics
2878877 when you have a chaotic system that is characterized by extreme randomness it paradoxically can produce ordered behavior after a certain amount of time
2878878 there is strong evidence that is happening here in our experiment
2878879 when things get atom small our notions of being able to put a specific particle in a specific place with a specific speed at a specific time become blurry
2878880 although they are held in place in the crystal structure the spins can interact with each other and change the direction in which theyre pointed in much the same way that magnets interact with each other when brought close together
2878881 somehow despite the fact these spins have very complicated interactions with each other and started out in completely different orientations they end up all moving in the same way after several milliseconds
2878882 thats never been seen before in a quantum mechanical system these guys are dancing together
2878883 the proposal encourages facilitates and harnesses entrepreneurial space achievement enabling a dynamic globally competitive commercial space sector is in line with national policy and is mutually beneficial to the air force and the state
2878884 we take great pride in fostering a vibrant commercial space sector and expect the spirit of innovation and attitude of cooperation that made this idea into a reality to be prevalent in the years to come
2878885 our primary mission here is to assure access to the high frontier this proposal better enables us to execute that mission
2878886 most zombie movies seem to be made from the point of view of a critique do you think there will ever be a zombie movie made from the point of view of a dissent
2878887 with cloud computer looming on the horizon it is important for us all to think of the privacy threats there as well
2878888 the tool resides with someone else and the data is stored somewhere else generally that is a bad idea
2878889 when information is in the public domain it is game over
2878890 information on your computer may get protection under the law but on someone elses it gets less protection
2878891 the information we are all giving to online companies is massive and dangerous and its going to get worse before it gets better
2878892 giving them our data is a clear and present risk
2878893 how hard would it be to target someone as a political activist or a person with aids
2878894 this is heresy but one day google will die what happens to data when a company dies is a big question
2878895 but we realised there were no stars in it so that it must be a cloud of gas
2878896 we now think that what were looking at is light from a quasar the bright stormy centre of a distant galaxy powered by a supermassive black hole
2878897 the quasar itself is no longer visible to us but its light continues to travel through space and the voorwerp is a massive light echo produced as this light strikes the gas
2878898 this discovery really shows how citizen science has come of age in the internet world
2878899 hannys attentiveness alerted us not only to a peculiar object but to a window into the cosmic past which might have eluded us for a long time otherwise
2878900 trying to understand the processes operating here has proven to be a fascinating challenge involving a whole range of astrophysical techniques and instruments around the world and beyond this has also been some of the most rewarding astronomy ive done in years
2878901 from the point of view of the voorwerp the galaxy looks as bright as it would have done before the black hole turned off its this light echo that has been frozen in time for us to observe
2878902 its rather like examining the scene of a crime where although we cant see them we know the culprit must be lurking somewhere nearby in the shadows
2878903 ic 2497 is so close that if the quasar was still shining today on a good night you could probably see it with a small telescope
2878904 the nearest active quasar called 3c 273 is 1 7 billion light years further away
2878905 its amazing to think that this object has been sitting in the archives for decades and that amateur volunteers can help by spotting things like this online
2878906 it was a fantastic present to find out on my 25th birthday that we will get observational time on the hubble space telescope to follow up this discovery
2878907 when we got the news about hannys voorwerp we were intrigued to find out what it was and fortunately we were able to slew the telescopes round and get some great images and spectra to study it
2878908 it was only later that we heard the story about how it had been discovered its inspirational that hanny picked out this object from galaxy zoo in her spare time and nobody had ever seen anything like it before
2878909 we are proud to have definiti 8k video system installed at the beijing planetarium it is the highest resolution planetarium in the world

2878949 there was not the sense that islam was inherently opposed to the west or inherently opposed to modern life or inherently opposed to universal traditions like rule of law
2878950 some correlation between the economic crash during the asian financial crisis and the acceleration of these islamic extremist forces
2878951 understand that not only are those in islam who would resort to violence a tiny fraction of the islamic world but that also the islamic world itself is diverse

2878954 making this team is up to me and how well i play
2878955 i need to perform really well in all the preseason games and show the coaching staff that i am the type of player who can contribute
2878956 i gotta go to work every day and improve every day
2878957 if im not getting better at certain things its really not good for me and a waste of time for me its hard to keep that focus knowing that every day you have to do something better if you slip its hard to get that rope back i think that if i can keep working on the things i need to work on i can be a contributor
2878958 brad is another all around guy we played him at fullback we played him as a backup tight end hes smart and he can kind of do it all so that increases his value because he can do more things and so i think special teams will impact him as well so well give him an opportunity on special teams

2878965 there is a gap in skills between the chinese team and the korean team we wanted to make the breakthrough but sadly we didnt achieve it
2878966 i think the more minutes we get together in the olympics the better it is
2878967 we have 180 minutes now and get 90 more against new zealand so we will improve our game from one game to another
2878968 i think the more minutes we get and the more we play together the more we can get done
2878969 i just got to go home and take care of myself its going to be a tight final
2878970 natalies just so good at racing and planning out her races so i just expect nothing but fast fast swimming tomorrow morning

2878983 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2878984 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2878985 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2878986 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2878987 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2878988 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2878989 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2878990 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2878991 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2878992 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2878993 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2878994 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2878995 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2878996 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2878997 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2878998 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2878999 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2879000 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2879001 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2879002 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

2879006 the press should avoid discriminatory or denigratory references to people
2879007 the continual reference to aliens and their link with some negative often illegal act would clearly create sub conscious concerns if not acrimonious feelings regarding foreign peoples
2879008 did not show how this use of alien draws empathy and understanding away
2879009 alien is brief and strong it fits a newspaper headline even foreigner which has the same meaning has nine letters to the five letters of alien phrases such as non national 11 letters displaced foreign national 24 letters economic migrant 15 letters are not found in the daily sun

2879032 d por sentado que acatar la decisi n del tribunal constitucional
2879033 dentro de la legalidad se est n cerrando todas las puertas
2879034 rodr guez zapatero ha tomado la decisi n unilateral y personal de suspender la consulta porque aqu su voluntad es imponer que los vascos no podamos hacer nada que desde madrid no quieren que hagamos ya nos han dicho en m s de una ocasi n que no tenemos derecho a decidir nuestro futuro y ahora nos est n diciendo que no tenemos derecho ni siquiera a opinar
2879035 es lo que estamos defendiendo en las reuniones que estamos manteniendo con el resto de formaciones pol ticas queremos convencerles de que la consulta se tiene que hacer y desgraciadamente a d a de hoy el pnv ya dej sentado que ellos van a acatar la decisi n del tc que es lo mismo que decir que no van a empujar para que la consulta se haga
2879036 paso importante en torno a la cuesti n de la materializaci n del derecho a decidir
2879037 si nos cierran esta v a inventaremos nuevas v as
2879038 es quiz esa falta de unidad o de uniformidad en las opciones de otras formaciones pol ticas las que impiden que proyectos importantes como el de ley de consulta no hayan sido socializados
2879039 es sacar el derecho a decidir del centro del debate pol tico y por eso es tan importante para zapatero que el pr ximo ejecutivo vasco no sea nacionalista
2879040 un candidato teledirigido desde madrid no va a defender los intereses de los vascos
2879041 se va a dedicar m s a las genuflexiones ante zapatero y el gobierno espa ol que a empujar por las necesidades de los vascos

2879044 he was in for one offensive snap rushing the passer his first play
2879045 but theyre basically street free agents right now is what we call them and everybodys looking for those guys those guys dont just grow on trees or theyd be on somebody elses roster
2879046 you can look for as many explanations as you want
2879047 jaymes rushed the passer the way he rushed on his only snap probably thousands of times since hes been to camp here he just got loaded wrong and unfortunately for him and for us hes going to be out for the season
2879048 i felt like i was starting to turn that corner but mentally i stayed with it
2879049 i think i mentioned after the game nothing good happens holding on to the football
2879050 you have to be quick with your decisions and trust what youre seeing not that everything ended up being his fault but youve got to get the ball out of your hand hes a quick study and i think hell be that much better next time out
2879051 random house deputy publisher thomas perry said in a statement the company received cautionary advice not only that the publication of this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
2879052 in this instance we decided after much deliberation to postpone publication for the safety of the author employees of random house booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the novel perry said

2879056 for everyone coming off the bench its all about energy
2879057 kara was the first one to come off and the defensive mind set changed once the rest of us came in it was contagious
2879058 she was the only person who had us in an offensive flow early on when we were struggling so keep going to the person whos hot
2879059 thats very unusual for us to take that type of attitude and have the type of chemistry that we have early its really scary
2879060 i told all these players from my experience playing in three olympics we cannot remember who scored what who had what rebounds
2879061 you just play and the only thing you remember is if you go home with gold or not thats whats important and everyone has taken on that attitude
2879062 i think theyre going to play great i think the energy in the arena will be electric i think thatll be fun for us also
2879063 itll be easy to get yourself up for that game
2879064 i dont have a choice i dont have a chance

2879089 the oil companies need to know that there is a limit on how much profit they can take in this economy
2879090 this liberal will be about socializing uh um would be about basically taking over and the government running all of your companies
2879091 i can see that this congresswoman is going to favor nationalizing the oil companies and making sure the prices go down
2879092 we the government should own the refineries then we can control how much gets into the market
2879093 were going to take things away from you on behalf of the common good

2879151 once bishops priests and others decided that they could use conscience to excuse them from obedience to truth as taught by the church when bishops and priests started giving conscience the authority to determine moral truth rather than obey the truth as taught by the church its not surprising that during those years some priests and some bishops started to follow their own conscience in terms of sexual misconduct

2879155 in this time of economic uncertainty floridians want real leadership and concrete ideas on how to end the republican recession not photo ops and publicity stunts
2879156 at a minimum bush could tell floridians correctly that he was doing what he could recognizing that governors have a very small role in directing the states economy charlies in a tougher spot because there is no discretionary money
2879157 i think the real issue is not the listening tour but is it a hearing tour
2879158 the public has to believe the governor feels what they feel and cares what they care

2879181 the frightening thing is they say they are taking no options off the table even nuclear first strike
2879182 that is my sense because the democratic leaders in the house are proposing no resistance whatsoever paul said
2879183 we saw this when a supplemental bill came up and the president asked for 107 billion for the war the democrat leadership gave them 162 billion

2879208 said there were no plans to redeploy the estimated 130 us troops and civilian contractors who he said were stationed in the area around tblisi

2879222 it is quite different going from potentially shooting a missile then going to your kids soccer game
2879223 you do stick around and see the aftermath of what you did and that does personalize the fight
2879224 you have a pretty good optical picture of the individuals on the ground the images can be pretty graphic pretty vivid and those are the things we try to offset we know that some folks have in some cases problems
2879225 no ones been naive enough to come in to interview but not know about that aspect of the job
2879226 theyre putting a missile down somebodys chimney and taking out bad guys and the next thing theyre taking their wife out to dinner their kids to school

2879241 he has a lot of races left there is somebody gearing up just to beat him every single day it will be exciting to watch him swim for the rest of the week
2879242 it doesnt change the race that much its just everybody is using a little bit better technology it might improve all the times a little bit more but the race is still the same
2879243 hes got two arms two legs just like a lot of our kids when you see that you want to be there too

2879255 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2879256 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2879257 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2879258 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2879259 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2879260 i accept the fact that im going to fall off this horse
2879261 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2879262 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2879263 i thought that since the us is supporting georgia there would be some control over the situation in south ossetia and that there would be a peaceful solution to the conflict but what is happening there now its not just war but war crimes george bush and georgian president mikhail saakashvili should answer to the crimes that are being committed the killing of innocent people running over by tanks of children and women throwing grenades into cellars where people are hiding
2879264 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2879265 pedimos a rusia que cese os ataques a reos e con misiles contra xeorxia respete a integridade territorial de xeorgia e retire as s as forzas de combate terrestres do territorio xeorgiano

2879268 the americans were going to smash them thats what we came here to do
2879269 you would think racing teammates might be a little easier
2879270 but actually it turns out to be more mentally tough we know that that team works well and very close with ace capps crew chief ed mcculloch so we know that their setup is very close to ours
2879271 more than that were fighting to help our teammates gary scelzi jack beckman and jerry toliver get into the top 10 not that were super solid in the top 10 but were solidly in the top 10 we want nothing more than to get those guys in there
2879272 approaching that round we had lane choice and we just got outran
2879273 all in all a great day i talked with michael waltrip this morning told him congratulations on another year with napa were real excited about that and i wished him good luck in watkins glen today and he wished me good luck and told me not to lose to a girl
2879274 so we had to beat ashley force the first round or i would have to had to answer to michael waltrip i didnt want to have to call him back and say we lost to a girl this was all said in fun of course ashley force is an outstanding and tough competitor
2879275 we struggled to qualify here and we went from being no 16 to knock off the top qualifier first round then we ran really well the second round and just got beat so it wasn t all bad
2879276 its time to get ready now for the draw charity softball game thursday night in reading because we had another practice with gary scelzis superchargers here in brainerd and i am very sore i can tell you my teammates are as well but its going to be a lot of fun and were looking forward to the next two races before the countdown starts
2879277 the result in this case was less than ideal from rhodes perspective
2879278 youll have multiple cpus being deployed on top of which you run multiple virtual machines and the net effect is you push a lot more i o traffic into the network
2879279 if you have 1 000 physical machines each deploying 10 virtual machines as far as the networks concerned you need 10 000 ports

2879312 i had told myself long ago that three books in a series are enough for my attention span and so after
2879313 prayerfully i decided to return to gresham setting the story fifteen years after julia hollis and her children first left london for abandoned coaching inn which became larkspur inn i believe readers would like to see how the children philip aleda and grace elizabeth and laurel turn out as adults but i like to inject fresh faces into every book hence jewel libby and her daughter becky find gresham a haven from a bad man writing the book was like coming home visiting old friends

2879339 president bush created this problem we would put in place rules so it never happens again
2879340 but a sound budget is based on making realistic promises and sticking to them
2879341 weve already got an unsustainable budget situation over the long term in the short term were in a big fiscal hole so its really important to hold the line
2879342 the important point is how much are the policies going to cost and extending the bush tax cuts has a cost

2879439 soldiers families support systems and equipment are stretched and stressed by the demands of lengthy and repeated deployments with insufficient recovery time
2879440 i have certainly given my support to 12 month deployments
2879441 operationally we would welcome that both because of the strain and the stress and really just a general recognition of the value in that and hopefully this reduction can allow that over time
2879442 in short this is a hollow announcement it has no immediate effect
2879443 it is nothing more than political posturing at the expense of our troops our soldiers are unraveling and they need their commander in chief to provide immediate relief
2879444 but it only resets us to where we were last winter

2879448 think not that i am come to destroy the law or the prophets i am not come to destroy but to fulfil
2879449 though philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of men
2879450 let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things
2879451 for if there be first a willing mind it is accepted according to that a man hath and not according to that he hath not
2879452 and the lord said unto david my father whereas it was in thine heart to build an house unto my name thou didst well that it was in thine heart
2879453 sincere intentions to do good shall be graciously approved and accepted of god though a teaching on christian stewardship should contain this comfort for saints who find themselves with a willing heart but without means
2879454 be not deceived god is not mocked for whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap for he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life everlasting
2879455 and let us not be weary in well doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not
2879456 as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them who are of the household of faith
2879457 from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love
2879458 stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith christ hath made us free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage
2879459 therefore as ye abound in every thing in faith and utterance and knowledge and see that ye
2879460 i speak not by commandment but by occasion of the forwardness of others and to prove the sincerity of your love
2879461 the divine influence upon the heart and reflection in the life
2879462 stewardship series part iii for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified gal 2 16
2879463 bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse that there may be meat in mine house and prove me now herewith saith the lord of hosts if i will not open you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that
2879464 now concerning the collection for the saints as i have given order to the churches of galatia even so do ye upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store as god hath prospered him that there be not gathering when i come
2879465 this kind of doing your own little thing means you are separated from christian tradition and wisdom over the centuries
2879466 i long for the day when i can give the responsibility of teaching to someone else warm a pew somewhere and not have to prepare sunday lessons for my family and not have to wonder where the money goes that i give into the offering plate and not wonder what my children are being taught nor trouble myself with the slant of the teaching when i can join the 99 9 of the others who name the name of christ in this country and take in whats dished out from the pulpit and the sunday school curriculum without regard for doctrinal integrity and only open me bible when the pastor asks me to every sunday morning and wednesday night id much rather spend my time indulging myself in my hobby and tv like gideon id rather tear down baals altars by night like moses id rather have someone else speak like peter i want to say its been fun lets go back to fishing like jonah id rather they just burn all the while feeding my appetite like samson unfortunately im like jeremiah his word burns from within and must come out regardless of whether i want it to or not im as jaded as reluctant as tired and as fed up as i could ever be in this position i resigned my ordination several years ago only to have to pick it up again at home please give me an honest valid scriptural reason to go back to a church and ill stop it now
2879467 because i seek no benefit from the irs in my giving i am free to give where it is needed in my sphere of influence gifts then become truly gifts as there is then no need to track my giving for write off purposes from bi lingual bibles for immigrants who work nearby to basic clothing needs for a prison inmate to a bill that needed paying for a missionary family i have purposed in my heart to give as needs come so long as there is the ability to give
2879468 in addition to communicating good things to those who teach we are to care for the needs of the saints there are many large buildings today that stand like edifices to lost opportunities to minister sustenance to brothers and sister in the lord it is not enough to have the church food pantry or the church office to apply to as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them who are of the household of faith gal 6 10 emphasis added we are an us a living body of many members if we are to experience fellowship on a high plane we must also be available to minister in the basics necessities the whole body of christ is to nourish itself under its head which is christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love eph 4 16

2879473 un d a al subirnos al autob s despu s de un partido le di al conductor la cinta y le ped que la pusiera sin decir nada fue una sorpresa todos nos pusimos a cantar y ese d a me di cuenta de que pod amos hacer algo grande porque all hab a un grupo unido
2879474 a los jugadores les prepar bamos im genes de los equipos rivales pero tambi n hac amos seguimientos a su juego
2879475 en el caso de iker casillas por ejemplo le preparamos un informe sobre como actuaba en las segundas salidas porque no s lo debe conocer al rival sino tambi n intentar mejorar el juego propio
2879476 bueno no todo fueron v deos y n meros tanto mi trabajo como el del resto del cuerpo t cnico tuvo mucho que ver con el aspecto psicol gico del grupo
2879477 se notaba una gran tensi n hasta que llegamos a los cuartos de final el equipo se sent a obligado a pasar esa fase y cuando se logr hubo como un suspiro de alivio y a la vez la sensaci n de ahora hay que rematar el trabajo
2879478 hab a un buen ambiente y eso hizo mucho luis dio la misma importancia a palop el tercer portero que no jug ni un minuto que a fernando torres pero es que en realidad para el cuerpo t cnico todos lo eran
2879479 pero el partido de grecia que ya no era tan importante tuvo el mismo tratamiento es cuesti n de profesionalidad
2879480 todos estaban deseando hacer el trabajo bien en el tiempo en que dur la eurocopa no hubo ni un momento de euforia cuando alguien lanzaba alg n mensaje de optimismo era acallado por el grupo con el argumento de no hemos ganado nada
2879481 eso s hubo fiest n tras ganar la final a alemania

2879485 debutar en unos juegos ol mpicos y contra el subcampe n mundial ha sido emocionante con una palabra se define todo

2879487 el 90 de mis sensaciones han sido muy buenas porque es muy dif cil jugar el primer partido en unos juegos como ha demostrado la propia selecci n griega hemos salvado el partido con un sobresaliente
2879488 no tenemos que pensar en la globalidad del torneo por ejemplo cuando hemos visto que ya estaba todo decidido en los ltimos cinco minutos como si ya pens ramos en otro partido hemos dejado de correr de abrir l neas de pase
2879489 ahora espero que podamos disponer de m s tiempo para poder encontrar la mejor forma de movernos y salir a la ciudad los jugadores deben estar siempre en la villa pensando s lo en baloncesto
2879490 me parece que ser la primera vez que juego un partido a esa hora los biorritmos no son los mejores y no puedes adaptar totalmente las necesidades del jugador a ese horario porque es imposible
2879491 el motivo no lo s quiz el ansia por hacerlo demasiado bien en el punto y final de su vida deportiva puede influir en el caso de lenika
2879492 me dijeron un par de palabritas que eran b sicas que mi hija de cuatro meses me est esperando en madrid que ten a que ir a buscarla con una medalla colgada al cuello que esto es una vez y hay que aprovecharlo

2879494 soy brusco y muy agresivo eso es lo que me ha hecho llegar hasta aqu as puedo suplir algunas deficiencias t cnicas
2879495 a m me llega en el mejor momento estoy centrado y cansad simo
2879496 soy una fuera de la ley detesto los sistemas esto es cada vez m s inhumano
2879497 detesto los sistemas se est en una sociedad gran hermano y no soy nada optimista esto es cada vez m s inhumano por eso no me interese envejecer todo est controlado ya no hay hueco para la espontaneidad va a ser terrible
2879498 somos los primeros que nos autoexigimos la presi n somos nosotros
2879499 se no soy yo nunca lo ser nunca hay que pensar que no est mal perder por pocos te tiene que doler perder
2879500 no hay mucho tiempo para pensar en lo que fuimos hace tres a os y en el paso del tiempo pero claro unos juegos son unos juegos filosof a claro que se puede hacer
2879501 y est muy bien pero hay tanto tantos partidos que al final no vale para nada hay muchas competiciones en balonmano y por lo tanto muchas lesiones los jugadores est n machacados y claro que queremos crear una selecci n b y trabajar con 30 y todo eso pero al final los que est n son los mejores los 14 que corren que atacan y que defienden
2879502 y no no nos relaja en absoluto el haber dejado de estar en el centro de las expectativas
2879503 porque nosotros somos los primeros que nos autoexigimos la presi n somos nosotros
2879504 lo decide todo un m nimo detalle es un gol menos a favor y uno m s en contra es un torneo
2879505 y estamos tan igualados que la diferencia es la definici n
2879506 china ha puesto un plan de partidos muy bien pensado
2879507 de otra forma no se explica que justo los dos partidos que juegan ante alemania y espa a los dos rivales m s dif ciles sean los que ha fijado a las ocho de la ma ana china adem s tendr una ventaja porque se viene preparando de madrugada desde hace tiempo ha adecuado el horario biol gico de sus jugadores para estar a tope muy temprano cuando lo normal es que el organismo alcance su m xima producci n hormonal a ltima hora de la tarde
2879508 pens que no me estaba moviendo que me parar a en el agua
2879509 ha sido el mayor dolor que nunca he experimentado en una carrera pens que no me estaba moviendo que me parar a en el agua
2879510 ste es un xito incre ble para el que he trabajado muy duro durante mucho tiempo no tengo remordimientos sobre mi preparaci n para estos juegos ol mpicos lo di todo hasta sentirme agotada
2879511 siento alivio no era cuesti n de recuperar el r cord sino de competir
2879512 no le gusta mezclar pol tica y deporte pero quiere ser un modelo para sus compatriotas adem s de llevarles algo de felicidad
2879513 desde ahora est claro game on juguemos va a ser muy buena tiene confianza y autocontrol
2879514 no ve a nadas fui a un m dico y me dijo que me olvidara me fui a otro que no lo vio tan mal adem s el seleccionador me tranquiliz me dijo que aunque no pudiera entrenarme m s de dos d as si el m dico me daba el alta vendr a a los juegos

2879541 uncle simon david is hildas grandson i spoke to hildas grandson
2879542 you could imagine how shocked he was when the name of his grandmother hilda glasberg appeared on the yad vashem database of shoah victims names testifying to her death

2879571 do not lift iron upon it the altar of g d shall be built of whole stones
2879572 iron was created to shorten the life of man and the altar was created to lengthen the life of man so it is not fitting that that which shortens should be lifted upon that which lengthens

2879587 the evidence to date is that a significant moderation in demand is now occurring and it is looking more likely the demand will remain subdued and economic growth will be fairly slow in the period ahead
2879588 while inflation is likely to remain high in the short term the board judged at its august meeting that demand was slowing to an extent that could be expected to bring about a significant reduction in inflation over time
2879589 on this basis the board decided that the existing monetary policy setting was appropriate for the time being
2879590 on the assumption that the subdued demand conditions are like to continue scope to move to a less restrictive monetary policy stance in the period ahead is increasing
2879591 the combination of falls in housing and equity prices means that household net wealth has declined in the first half of this year

2879599 beijing games organisers have worked extremely hard to put into effect their olympic promises and to allow overseas journalists to report on the olympics
2879600 almost every day well hold an average of two news conferences
2879601 despite progress in some areas the fccc is disappointed that the chinese government has neither fully lived up to its olympic promise of a free media environment nor made a clear cut and enduring commitment to further openings after the games
2879602 we strongly urge china to match its growing global influence with greater accountability
2879603 we have sufficient forces to contain the violence in north cotabato
2879604 we really wanted the elections postponed because it could delay the implementation of any agreement that would be reached if the two sides conclude a deal by november 2009
2879605 unless we get a full blown war over there then thats the only time it might significantly affect
2879606 it seems that we are having a good election and the people our brothers and sisters in the south are showing us the way
2879607 a genuinely neutral mediator not the russian government must begin a process of negotiations immediately

2879611 the summer is historically a dead time in recruiting so this has definitely changed the way were looking at how we fill our talent need
2879612 the smaller shops are realizing this is a great time to pick off talent
2879613 i think an average mba interested in investment banking is thinking he or she may need to look more broadly and i think the boutique firms will capitalize on that
2879614 theres a general anxiety among students now i dont think anyone trusts any of the companies whether its an investment bank corporation or a commercial bank anything could happen
2879615 we had a job offer rescinded from someone in the automotive industry so certainly there is risk across all the industries this year
2879616 i think manufacturers who make money should do all they can to make their products safe
2879617 this is just one step it ought to be banned for everything
2879618 many common everyday products could disappear from grocery stores all across california
2879619 we should definitely take steps to limit our exposure to the substance
2879620 anything we can do to reduce bisphenol a could potentially have big payoffs to protecting human health
2879621 its the start of something that can be great weve been waiting for years for this moment
2879622 i dont know how many people were watching the game but it was an honour to play in it
2879623 we were all excited and anxious this game was over the top
2879624 but we have a saying back home that when youre good you play for the name on the front of your jersey instead of the name on the back our guys all play for the name on the front of their jersey
2879625 with those bills and the tuition coming due and hanging over your head it does put you in a bit of a panic
2879626 only to find out the lenders theyve chosen are no longer going to be offering loans this fall
2879627 some of these rates have no caps which means if interest rates rise you could be up to paying 15 to 18 percent on these loans
2879628 you know when he comes out so its very scary
2879629 it took me four years to paint like raphael but a lifetime to paint like a child
2879630 i concluded that an active sexual relationship between two people of the same sex might therefore reflect the love of god in a way comparable to marriage if and only if it had about it the same character of absolute covenanted faithfulness

2879633 the americans were going to smash them thats what we came here for
2879634 are any of the characters modeled on people you know
2879635 we do think there are many witnesses because at that time around seven p m there were a lot of people in the park or in the surroundings of the park
2879636 there were also people who were part of the altercation and many people playing sports or just sitting in the park
2879637 were talking about the death of a man its a major investigation

2879640 seharusnya tragedi itu tidak boleh terjadi jika panitia siap saya prihatin dan ikut berkabung dunia musik kembali tercoreng
2879641 kejadian ini akibat ketidaksiapan panitia seharusnya mereka panitia bisa memprediksi berapa banyak penonton yang akan hadir memikirkan segi keamanan dan bisa mengukur kapasitas gedung apalagi menyangkut band band yang memiliki komunitas tertentu
2879642 apapun warna musiknya bila ingin tampil untuk kepentingan penonton jangan pernah pandang enteng suatu even kalau meremehkan ya kejadian seperti ini
2879643 bandung ini kan kota musik kok gedung keseniannya saja begitu semoga dengan kejadian ini pemerintah bisa mengkaji serius
2879644 pasti mereka tidak memikirkan faktor keamanan harusnya jumlah penontonnya dibatasi
2879645 bukan apa apa sih karena kalau sudah mabuk tersulut sedikit bisa terpacu kekuatan tubuh juga bisa langsung mudah terjadi hal hal yang tidak diinginkan
2879646 yang pasti saya shock dengan kematian sepuluh orang penonton sebagai musisi saya prihatin semoga ini yang terakhir
2879647 harusnya ini tidak boleh terjadi apa panitia tidak memikirkan segi kenyamanan konser kalau ingin menyuguhkan tampilan di tempat terbatas panitia harus siap dengan fasilitas misalnya mereka memasang screen sehingga penonton di luar gedung bisa meyaksikan band kesayangannya
2879648 kalau gedung kapasitasnya 600 orang ya segitu jangan sampai ditambah menjadi 800 ratus penonton karena segala sesuatu yang berlebihan akan ada efeknya ya kejadian kan ini pasti over kapasitas
2879649 saya tahu ada kejadian musik di braga tapi saya tidak mengira kalau harus menelan korban sebanyak itu
2879650 memang dari segi tempat pertunjukkan seharusnya bukan untuk musik karena kalau untuk konser banyak faktor yang harus dipikirkan tidak sesederhana di aacc itu

2879652 there is no such thing in america as race transcendence and obamas going to find that out real soon
2879653 theres no such thing as post racial in america because if you push the envelope too far youre going to hear about it
2879654 just because barack obama is black doesnt mean he gets a pass on being held accountable on issues that matter to black people
2879655 im not an obama critic or a mccain critic the term itself is dismissive and insulting
2879656 we have an awkward history about how to talk about race in the nation and in newsrooms
2879657 but i do think we are all searching for the language
2879658 its still a sensitive topic but i think the doors been opened to the conversation whether or not that conversation will happen in a reasonable or superficial way i dont think anyone has a real sense of how it will play out right now
2879659 i want to do what i always try to do which is to be authentic in my coverage
2879660 im an advocacy journalist not a journalist in the traditional sense i believe my role in the media is to get people to re examine the assumptions they hold
2879661 now some of you regard it as keeping a brother down holding a brother back because you regard it that way you dont understand that this is the role that ive always played

2879735 i studied reincarnation in india and thought there was truth and justice in the theory that we come back to learn and grow i taught the theory and wanted to bring it to the world i felt that i remembered far back into my past but i was mistaken when you become sensitive and can feel the spirits around you they speak to you by impressions and their past will be like a panorama a person feels it and will relive the past of spirits but the mistake is made of taking this for the memory of past incarnations i did not know this when i lived on earth but when i came to the spirit side of life i learned differently once you reach the spirit world where all is congenial where all is life where all is bliss where there is no jealousy no envy where all is one grand harmony do you think for one moment that you would want to leave that beautiful condition to come back to earth and be a little baby restricted in mind and knowing nothing whatever
2879736 i had not known of a spirit to reincarnate and in this my disappointment has been grievous karma exists in the spirit world and many spirits of my association have become pure and perfected spirits through renunciation yet they have remained spirits and have progressed to the highest realms without taking another body
2879737 take the chair in front of us and try not to be nervous
2879738 what are all these spirits doing in the room get them out of here
2879739 you do this you do that this reading is over
2879740 reincarnationists do not seem to want to consider the logical explanations for their experiences which are sometimes as little as feeling drawn to a place etc does anyone really consider this their proof of a past life

2879744 you probably have no idea what you are talking about
2879745 spirits are giving you impressions of their past its not you remembering
2879746 i had not known of a spirit to reincarnate and in this my disappointment has been grievous karma exists in the spirit world and many spirits of my association have become pure and perfected spirits through renunciation yet they have remained spirits and have progressed to the highest realms without taking another body
2879747 when i reached the spirit world i found such glory and happiness and beauty that i now realize this little earth is a grammar school not a university or even a high school it is only the first lesson of life
2879748 you can learn in one day here what takes years to learn on earth forget reincarnation because it is a sandbag around your neck you will have it so centered on your mind that you will think of nothing else and you will stay just where you are you cannot progress because your mind will always revert to the earth again you cannot live on the earth more than once life is progression not retrogression

2879764 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god v 2 the same was in the beginning with god v 3 all things were made by him and without him was not any thing made that was made v 4 in him was life and the life was the light of men v 5 and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not v 6 there was a man sent from god whose name was john v 7 the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe v 8 he was not that light but was sent to bear witness of that light v 9 that was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world v 10 he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not v 11 he came unto his own and his own received him not v 12 but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name v 13 which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god v 14 and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth v 15 john bare witness of him and cried saying this was he of whom i spake he that cometh after me is preferred before me for he was before me v 16 and of his fulness have all we received and grace for grace v 17 for the law was given by moses but grace and truth came by jesus christ v 18 no man hath seen god at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him

2879769 god after he spoke long ago to the fathers in the prophets in many portions and in many ways in these last days has spoken to us in his son whom he appointed heir of all things through whom also he made the world and he is the radiance of his glory and the exact representation of his nature and upholds all things by the word of his power
2879770 in the past god spoke to our forefathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways but in these last days he has spoken to us by his son whom he appointed heir of all things and through whom he made the universe the son is the radiance of gods glory and the exact representation of his being sustaining all things by his powerful word
2879771 now the main point in what has been said is this we have such a high priest who has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens
2879772 the great object of hebrews then is to set before these believers eyes christ the son of god the son of man the great high priest in heaven and to cause them constantly to occupy their thought and worship with god into whose presence christ by his blood has brought them without the camp within the veil

2879778 32now the full number of those who believed were of one heart and soul and no one said that any of the things that belonged to him was his own but they had everything in common 33and with great power the apostles were giving their testimony to the resurrection of the lord jesus and great grace was upon them all 34there was not a needy person among them for as many as were owners of lands or houses sold them and brought the proceeds of what was sold 35and laid it at the apostles feet and it was distributed to each as any had need 36thus joseph who was also called by the apostles barnabas which means son of encouragement a levite a native of cyprus 37sold a field that belonged to him and brought the money and laid it at the apostles feet
2879779 what of the following issues will be the most important to you when you decide how to vote for the president

2879865 it was an opportunity to go over to china and do something that has probably not been done in the past go to china and do some comedy
2879866 there were days when we got promising news and days when we got not so encouraging news
2879867 but we decided to stick it out until the end and it paid off
2879868 our motto was lets just go until they tell us to stop
2879869 there were moments where you were just being watched very closely
2879870 we still did what we wanted to do but i was hurrying it up saying come on come on lets go it was a subconscious thing

2879875 we do think there are many witnesses because at that time around seven p m there were a lot of people in the park or in the surroundings of the park
2879876 there were also people who were part of the altercation and many people playing sports or just sitting in the park
2879877 were talking about the death of a man its a major investigation
2879878 they were basically going there to witness what it was like on the ground in beijing to use the olympics to legitimize their rule over tibet and to whitewash their human rights record
2879879 their intention was to go and see how the chinese government are using the games and their assumptions were confirmed
2879880 we want to send a clear message that the truth has to be exposed
2879881 the true reality behind the hosting of these olympic games the stories that are not being told because of the security and the control of the media
2879882 weve been in contact with all of them and they are well
2879883 oh i only do couture im too fancy for sportwear
2879884 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
2879885 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
2879886 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2879887 we cannot just go out alone on this and talk and act unilaterally we dont have much impact i believe in terms of our unilateral declarations anymore with the administrations approach to the world
2879888 were alarmed by this entire situation and every escalatory step is a further problem
2879889 if those russian ships leave that port in the black sea and if ukraine decides that it is not going to allow those ships back into that port that is a potentially much greater conflagration involving a wider regional area
2879890 right now our focus is on working with both sides with the europeans and with a whole variety of international institutions and organizations to get the fighting to stop
2879891 it is ridiculous to ask us to do this because georgia will never use force against its own people as simple as that
2879892 hes a great kid and leads by example and is our team captain hes also the chiefs all time career home run leader with 85 and is the career leader in rbi with 359 he ranks second in career hits with 464 those are big numbers for amateur baseball
2879893 hes unbelievable he plays on three different teams at the same time and is just a real good guy very quiet
2879894 i dont know how he does it between work and all the games and traveling around this year in particular is extraordinary because hes playing well in each league hes very disciplined hes just phenomenal about the game i mean were all doing it for free but he just loves baseball he always comes prepared he sleeps right eats properly
2879895 literally hes a professional hitter thats the attitude he takes
2879896 theres not a pitch he hasnt seen i would think in any mens league considering he did get drafted that alone would give him the edge he puts up numbers but in two or three different leagues
2879897 its a daily thing i come home do a load of laundry and see what my game plan is i just love baseball
2879898 this is my drug honestly im here with guys in somerville working out ill set up netting in the aerobic studio during offseason and take 150 swings

2879902 he appeared to be a very down to earth guy
2879903 a lot has changed since i was involved with olympics com during the sydney 2000 games regarded at the time as the very first digital games then the official site was the leader in all major markets
2879904 now news and media websites are more sophisticated with multimedia capabilities that make it very difficult for a once every four years site to compete against
2879905 when i saw the movie with an audience for the first time i was so surprised and blown away by how much people were laughing
2879906 for me i was doing the most serious and painful drama ever woody is so clever i think he managed to make all of us forget that we were doing a comedy
2879907 lives in a very dark and painful space she is trapped in her head i think thats one of the worst things that can happen to someone
2879908 her pain is real so i didnt want to laugh at that at all

2879918 torture outside the olympic village a guide to chinas labour camps
2879919 citizens did not have the right to change their government and many who openly expressed dissenting political views were harassed detained or imprisoned abuses included instances of extrajudicial killings torture and mistreatment of prisoners leading to numerous deaths in custody coerced confessions arbitrary arrest and detention and incommunicado detention
2879920 the communist party bosses see the games as a milestone marking chinas emergence as a world power it is perfectly natural for china to want to showcase its economic might as well as its sporting prowess but the world should not pass up this opportunity to look realistically at where its most populous country is progressing china is clearly uncomfortable about being subjected to such scrutiny its leadership is used to hiding behind an ideological facade this cannot last forever if the olympics mark the start of chinas sprint for global credibility it has got off to a mixed start china is not the maoist dictatorship of the cultural revolution bureaucratic and economic interests jostle for influence there has been a limited opening up of debate in academic circles and a strengthening of civil society but by brutally suppressing dissent clamping down on restive minorities in tibet and elsewhere and restricting freedom of information the regime has shown it has a long way to go there is little doubt that an open challenge to the communist partys rule would lead to an immediate and brutal tiananmen style crackdown

2879933 i became totally blank like someone hit on the head by a wooden plank it became hard to explain on why id become increasingly insane why was there a frequent mood switch which appeared to be a negative glitch i sounded as though lifes to depart with my senses totally fallen apart a query on my purpose of life long after it became a sharpened knife with no thrill and no sprill every passing second like hell until i saw that smile spill out of the mouth like an elixir pill life took an u turn and here on willve no burn with the disastrous past buried and the present thoughts steadied now the purpose in life is to travel that extra mile to always catch the seraphim smile

2879939 going out first in the dressage was a disadvantage and after that my chances of winning an individual medal were slim so the best i could do was a strong effort for the team
2879940 i put a solid score on the board for the team and they can take a few risks now
2879941 companies that meet the prescribed threshold norms and regulations will have a floating window to notify the authority from the date of signing of the loi to the inking of the agreement however the notification will have to be made by the company within 30 days from the execution of the shareholders agreement or else the act stipulates penal provisions
2879942 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2879943 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2879944 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2879945 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2879946 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2879947 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2879948 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2879949 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2879950 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2879951 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2879952 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2879953 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2879954 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2879955 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2879956 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2879957 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2879958 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2879959 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2879960 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2879961 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2879962 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2879963 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2879964 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2879965 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
