3640085 i shall keep the silence of my heart with greater care so that in the silence of my heart i hear his words of comfort and from the fullness of my heart i comfort jesus in the distressing disguise of the poor
3640086 my heart is restless until it rests in you o lord
3640087 all night long in my bed i searched for the one my heart loves
3640088 i will get up now and go about the city through its streets and squares i will search for the one my heart loves

3640099 on our roadways public safety has to be the number one issue
3640100 putting flaggers out on state highways is going to cause someone to get hurt whether its the flaggers or drivers on those roadways
3640101 i wouldnt say its a disappointment but anyone who looks at this with a straight face would have to say were not going to see much change
3640102 well continue to look into modifying things as we go forward
3640103 i remember coming here and it was all about alternative lifestyles
3640104 the internet has opened up the world wide and were competing with everyone now
3640105 provincetown isnt turning straight no ones trying to make it straight
3640106 but weve always been trendsetters theres a long history of gay men going into places creating fabulous things and then people coming and joining us look at the south end
3640107 it used to be that you could walk down the street holding hands with a man and you felt safe now you feel gawked at
3640108 the thing about provincetown is that its always been inclusive first for artists then for gays
3640109 thats the whole charm of it everyone feels like they belong here
3640110 we could see there were people inside but there was nothing you could do it was horrible
3640111 one hundred feet in either direction and he could have hit some cars
3640112 i hope one day that things will be back to normal
3640113 i would love to be able to sit up and watch television with him after the kids have gone to bed i guess i can keep hoping and praying
3640114 they were good neighbors and it was just a tragic loss
3640115 it was really a brand new plane if there were any problems it wouldnt have been cleared to fly
3640116 he was the kind of guy you could go to when you had a question about process or procedure
3640117 he was someone who worshipped the process and followed the rules he had opinions but he put the process above anything else
3640118 he was a guy who was public spirited and public minded
3640119 regardless of which side of the issue people were on they all respected joe
3640120 i think hes crashed his altitude went up down up down and then he disappeared off the radar at really low altitude
3640121 people rushed over and tried to help but it was just too late the flames were too intense
3640122 we ran outside we saw the flames and the smoke and we could just see the tail of the plane
3640123 traditionally we will see a few skirmishes but frontal attacks and positioning will end
3640124 i saw russian planes bombing our villages and killing our soldiers but i could not do anything and this will always be with me
3640125 russia has said it has ended its invasion but in reality it has not
3640126 our relationship with georgia is more important so that russia will have influence over the whole south caucuses just as it has for centuries
3640127 the downside risk to our growth expectations in 2008 09 is primarily from a further deterioration in global conditions with its attendant impact on india be it in the sphere of oil prices or capital markets
3640128 iran is friends with the american and israel people no nation in the world is our enemy this is an honor
3640129 people who live in israel are either palestinians or those who have occupied the region with whom iran is not friends
3640130 all these players whove gone abroad its a loss of talent for the team but its also a source of pride for chinese people
3640131 i just like to work with the animals and getting them tame so i can lead them around the showroom

3640134 it is so special to see someone from chandigarh achieve a feat like this which no indian has done before his achievement is much bigger than any other sporting achievement in this country including our team effort in winning the 1983 cricket world cup
3640135 it was my dream to see some indian winning an individual olympics gold as i had missed it narrowly in the 1960s now our government should pay special heed so that we can produce many more abhinav bindras in future
3640136 i am writing a letter to the prime minister to felicitate abhinav with the bharat ratna award if they can give it to politicians artists and film stars then why not to this extraordinary sportsman
3640137 the only key factor behind abhinavs success is that he had a dream in his mind and luckily got full support from his father in realising his dream one thing is quite encouraging for the budding players that abhinav did it entirely on his own without any help from the government or anyone
3640138 abhinavs father a s bindra put in his time money and everything that he could do and today the glorious outcome is before everyone money did play an important part but that was not all his determination to succeed was more important
3640139 abhinav bindras determination shows on his face he is very cool and composed i was expecting an olympics medal from him since he debuted at sydney olympics in 2000 and this time also i had many hopes from him
3640140 i had the same joyous feeling as i had during indias sole world cup victory in 1983 it is a matter of great pride for the whole country and especially for the chandigarh people that a young boy from this region has won the first olympics individual gold

3640149 making sure that investors 1031 funds are secure is expensive and time consuming
3640150 so a lot of 1031 exchange companies dont do it
3640151 as long as there is new money coming in that you can use to pay out the 1031 exchange funds that have to go out youre ok
3640152 but as soon as the market slowed he needed to get those funds back into the 1031 exchange company but apparently couldnt
3640153 but its amazing how patient people have become in the wake of the indymac bank failure
3640154 in a bad economy where 1031 exchange companies cut corners is with the bonds which can be expensive
3640155 the irs is unforgiving on this issue because they say you have the right to choose any 1031 exchange company you want if you choose a company that turns out to be a bunch of crooks the irs says its your problem you still owe the taxes
3640156 its most peoples life savings and they never ask these important questions about security what we are often asked is why were going to keep the funds in a trust account that only earns 2 percent
3640157 they keep asking if there isnt a place where we could earn a little more

3640399 while many u s jewelry manufacturers have found it more profitable to farm work out to other countries weve relios chosen to stay and uphold our made in the usa value system and its paid off
3640400 of course there are certain concessions weve had to make there are hardly any stone cutters left in the u s so many of our stones and beads are sourced worldwide but everything else is done right here at our albuquerque factory from design modeling the original and casting to stone setting and assembly all right here under one roof it helps us serve our customers better to have that kind of quality control
3640401 consistent customer service has gotten us where we are today and thats not all
3640402 were relios very committed to the idea that in order to be successful all stakeholders must be satisfied employees customers vendors and shareholders we focus a lot on employee team building

3640404 textaloud quickly became a very important part of my learning process
3640405 then when reading text on a web page or in an e mail whenever i needed to check on how to pronounce the words i simply played them with textaloud
3640406 i could do this easily from within outlook firefox and internet explorer using the textaloud toolbars or from other applications using the clipboard monitoring feature
3640407 i installed an electronic dictionary which meant i was able to select an unknown word or phrase for a translation if needed
3640408 but the end result is that textaloud now speaks an english word to me using an english voice then repeats the word twice in german using the klaus german voice this process allows me enough time to repeat the word out loud and then finishes by repeating a phrase also incorporating the target word
3640409 textaloud is great for learning the proper pronunciations of foreign words no matter what the language
3640410 in addition since textaloud works with all standard text files all of the steps needed to create word repetitions and other exercises can be automated
3640411 these are invaluable for quickly and efficiently creating a custom language lesson
3640412 i love the fact that textaloud dutifully creates audio files for all my german language words and phrases which i can then sync with itunes into my treo and use whenever i have the time and inclination and wherever i go
3640413 ive also created audio books in english for long car trips with the family
3640414 the beauty of textaloud is that it is easy to use for the beginner and powerful for the advanced user
3640415 it has simplified every step of my language learning life i am no longer tied to the computer nor do i need to sit down with a book i can learn on a walk on a bus plane train anywhere

3640606 theres no question that we are in a mass extinction spasm right now
3640607 amphibians have been around for about 250 million years they made it through when the dinosaurs didnt the fact that theyre cutting out now should be a lesson for us
3640608 my feeling is that behind all this lies the heavy hand of homo sapiens
3640609 or we might be seeing the start of it right now
3640610 but no matter what the start date empirical data clearly show that extinction rates have dramatically increased over the last few decades
3640611 the target would never know what hit them further there would be no munition fragments that could be used to identify the source of the strike
3640612 screening for depression during pregnancy is important for this population group given latinas high rates of fertility and births to single women particularly among more acculturated u s born latinas
3640613 the sample for this study was a low income population our conclusions may or may not be different for women in other socioeconomic status ses groups hence more research needs to be conducted among latinas from differing ses groups including research focusing on the role of social support and cultural values beliefs related to childbirth and pregnancy among latinas
3640614 the higher prevalence rate of depression in americanized latina women is of concern in our community as the population demographics clearly indicate a significant rate of growth of this group in their childbearing years
3640615 thus it is important to more clearly understand the circumstances that affect their physical and emotional well being during pregnancy so that preventive measures can be initiated this is critical for the overall health of both the mother and child
3640616 women who were us born were significantly more likely than mexican born women to meet the cutoff score 21 on the ces d scale women who conducted their interview in english were significantly more likely to express depressive symptoms compared to women who conducted their interview in spanish
3640617 our main finding was that reward dependence is the only personality dimension correlated with opiate receptor binding and that positive correlation was restricted to the ventral striatum which is considered the key area of the human reward system and of the development of addictive behavior
3640618 this correlation means that people with high reward dependence have a high concentration of opiate receptors available in that area while people with low dependence have fewer opiate receptors
3640619 this is a novel finding and will provide a deeper understanding of the functional relation between human personality neurobiology and addictive behaviour

3640625 as a result of the severe financial crisis investors are increasingly seeking individual advice security and transparency these are areas in which the vontobel group can draw on its strengths

3640631 when women feel like crying they tend to hide it what this kind of delicate feeling and lingerie have in common is that both are only revealed to the important person in a womans life
3640632 i designed my lingerie to look like the face of a crying woman to illustrate this similar trait
3640633 for my showpiece i was inspired by the glamour of the 30s i used a lot of high quality fabric such as silk and lace my main inspiration came from the little black dress which vogue magazine in 1935 described as nothing in fashion is as new
3640634 my design was based on making a little black dress out of lingerie
3640635 my main inspiration came from the desire to make something beautiful out of trash from the atmosphere and fascination i experience when i am at the market or in a second hand shop
3640636 i love the way the elements clothes furniture art and jewellery with their lively colours are mixed and keep the balance of chaos and the way every element tells me its hidden story
3640637 a little the more extreme the design the less practical it is we have to see if it will sell well
3640638 i think we cannot have one without the other we are here to see inspiration but if we only go for inspiration we cannot afford it we have to go commercial to finance the inspiration
3640639 beautiful lingerie must bring the best out of the woman who wears it and that depends on the style of the woman whether it is classic or trendy good lingerie also needs to fit well
3640640 it has a lot of glamour and picked up the trend of marie antoinette very well the craftsmanship was beautiful and the lingerie fitted the model perfectly
3640641 i cannot believe that i am here at this international award ceremony and that im meeting so many other designers and sharing experiences i am very happy and grateful for this opportunity

3640646 the law has been amended and no minor can be contracted into marriage with guardian or parental permission or without permission
3640647 but because of religious pressure the court can decide otherwise

3640649 even in the womens shelter run by the government they keep on calling them on the phone
3640650 they keep on threatening them there also thats why they cant change their minds
3640651 they told them not to go to court or they would kill them

3640655 maintaining a tight monetary policy stance and active fiscal and other methods are necessary to bring down inflation rates

3640657 our mouse model is a step forward in understanding the pathogenesis of this disease and it may help us understand how we age in general
3640658 but the disease is probably much more frequent than previously inferred
3640659 as it is part of a spectrum of disorders with diverse clinical manifestations such as anemia and lung fibrosis
3640660 dirks mutant mouse is the first faithful mouse model for a human telomere disease
3640661 together these results suggest that in patients suffering from dyskeratosis congenita the enzyme telomerase cant elongate telomeres as fast as the nucleases chew them away

3640669 this is a scandal one on a par with the tainted blood scandal
3640670 we consider ourselves a generous society so we really have to wonder why there arent more organ donors

3640672 since the beginning of this year we have seen the deployment of some new tactics by insurgents
3640673 they are no longer targeting civilians by planting bombs on buses as they did in the 1990s but attacking government personnel army and the police this is aimed at winning the general population on their side
3640674 chinas success in fighting those terrorists at home has made it impossible for them to survive underground and many are now training abroad
3640675 in 2001 it may have been premature to say that the east turkestan islamic movement was part of the global jihad but by now many of its elements have spent so much time in the tribal border areas of pakistan that we cant really say for sure what cause they stand for
3640676 they are trying to show that their actions are aimed at whom they view as their main opponent the chinese government
3640677 things will be finalised today it will be a government of national consensus
3640678 efforts for a consensus government were still on in spite of the dispute between the maoists and the nepali congress over the defense portfolio
3640679 the passage to the formation of the next government should not be obstructed even if the nepali congress continues with its claim to the defense ministry
3640680 nepali congress will not join the government as an opposition party it will play an active role in constitution making
3640681 musharraf has continued to cling to the office of the president defying the clear verdict of the nation in the february 18 elections the people had voted against his dictatorship and steps taken on november 3 2007
3640682 since the supreme court was prevented by the illegal removal from office of judges who refused to take oath under pco from ruling on the validity of general musharrafs election in october 2007 we support the governments decision to impeach him under article 47 of the constitution and call upon the government to bring these proceedings to a speedy conclusion
3640683 we call upon the government to take these steps simultaneously with the commencement of the impeachment proceedings rather than after their conclusion

3640696 we are not suggesting any changes to the way we use desal
3640697 we need this information only for planning for future uses of our water supplies
3640698 this is one more step farther toward turning on the switch
3640699 i want to be very careful about even getting any closer to turning on the switch
3640700 we should be fully vetting how much conservation is possible and what money that takes to achieve
3640701 we shouldnt be looking at desal and then conservation we should be looking at conservation and then desal
3640702 if other agencies have an interest in desal they should help us with the study cost
3640703 its an incredible asset we really need to know how much its going to cost and how much its going to take if we need it
3640704 goleta city alert is a powerful communication tool and greatly enhances goletas existing emergency preparedness and response capabilities
3640705 we used the goleta city alert system to provide information to residents during the gap fire and while we had not officially launched the system we were able to reach out to residents and businesses within a matter of minutes
3640706 the program is absolutely voluntary but we do urge our citizens to participate
3640707 by allowing our citizens to participate with this new technology we are able to in mass send out a message with time sensitive stuff such as the gap fire
3640708 this is a step in the right direction any time you provide information to the community about an incident it helps to keep our community together and safe
3640709 the problem is we have to find the most immediate way to communicate with them if there power goes out or you are away from home you can still receive messages from the system on your cell phone its a very valuable tool we can use to help keep our community safe
3640710 goleta city alert is just another tool in our toolbox to ensure that residents and businesses in goleta have the information they need in an emergency
3640711 certainly the gap fire helped us to realize how critical of a tool this will be for us
3640712 in addition to sending safety related notifications such as a gas leak or missing person we plan to use goleta city alert to send public interest announcements including notifications of road closures or power outages among other things
3640713 the system is only as good as the information that is entered into it i strongly encourage residents and businesses to register their contact information into the goleta city alert database to make sure they are ready to receive important timely information at any point throughout their day
3640714 these are the types of projects that will truly inspire others to install solar
3640715 to say that solar is blossoming everywhere is just an understatement
3640716 it was even worse than the hateful stuff they used in promoting it
3640717 interestingly they parked in front of a gate that had three different signs on it saying no hunting and or no firearms
3640718 we are very serious about enforcing this ban on hunting in sedgwick reserve
3640719 and people need to know what not only are we enforcing it during hunting season were there all year
3640720 kayaking up the goleta slough under the full moon is a very easy yet very special experience also they provide wet suits for late afternoon ocean kayaking if one is so inclined
3640721 patrik is great at giving instruction to people who have never been in the ocean kayaking and the food is always great an all around fun evening

3640733 you try to get the best and you try to get more than somebody else you try to be no 1 in the collection field
3640734 most of your coupons today like the ones in the recent issues run anywhere from 5 to 10 and these are for five and 10 cent coupons
3640735 the thing is a lot of them you just cant get if you go into canadian tire and you spend 50 they might give you 10 or 15 cents in coupons thats not really enough to build a collection on you have to find somebody whos got a bunch
3640736 yes it is pretty enough and opaque enough to be worn as a dress but it is also shapewear that is sexy and when you take off your dress you have sexy lingerie on as well

3640757 i dont know about you but i am not initially attracted by the idea of my brain as a sort of dung heap in which the larvae of other peoples ideas renew themselves before sending out copies of themselves in an informational diaspora it seems at first to rob my mind of its importance as an author and a critic who is in charge according to this vision we or our memes
3640758 the first rules of memes as it is for genes is that replication is not necessarily for the good of anything replicators flourish that are good at replicating as dawkins has put it a meme that made its bodies run over cliffs would have a fate like that of a gene for making bodies run over cliffs it would tend to be eliminated from the meme pool but this does not mean that the ultimate criterion for success in meme selection is gene survival obviously a meme that causes individuals bearing it to kill themselves has a grave disadvantage but not necessarily a fatal one a suicidal meme can spread as when a dramatic and well publicized martyrdom inspires others to die for a deeply loved cause and this in turn inspires others to die and so on
3640759 meme vehicles inhabit our world alongside the fauna and flora
3640760 we are all well aware that we live today awash in a sea of paper borne memes breathing in an atmosphere of electronically borne memes memes now spread around the world at the speed of light and replicate at rates that make even fruit flies and yeast cells look glacial in comparison they leap promiscuously from vehicle to vehicle and from medium to medium and are proving to be virtually unquarantinable memes like genes are potentially immortal but like genes they depend on the existence of a continuous chain of physical vehicles persisting in the face of the second law of thermodynamics books are relatively permanent and inscriptions on monuments are even more permanent but unless these are under the protection of human conservators they tend to dissolve in time as with genes immortality is more a matter of replication than of the longevity of individual vehicles the preservation of the platonic memes via a series of copies of copies is a particularly striking case of this although some papyrus fragments of platos texts roughly contemporaneous with him have been recently discovered the survival of the memes owes almost nothing to such long range persistence todays libraries contain thousands if not millions of physical copies and translations of the meno while the key ancestors in the transmission of this text turned to dust centuries ago
3640761 the huge arrays of garish signs that compete for our attention along commercial strips in every region of the country are the exact counterpart in the infosphere of the magnificent redwood forests of the biosphere
3640762 the memes for normative concepts for ought and good and truth and beauty are among the most entrenched denizens of our minds and that among the memes that constitute us they play a central role
3640763 the beavers dam the spiders web the birds nest as not merely products of the phenotype the individual organism considered as a functional whole but rather as parts of the phenotype on a par with the beavers teeth the spiders legs the birds wing
3640764 there is no radical discontinuity one can be a mammal a father a citizen scholar democrat and an associate professor with tenure
3640765 since memetic evolution occurs on a time scale thousands of times faster than genetic evolution however in the period since there have been memes only tens of thousands of years the contributing effects of meme structures on our constitution on human phenotypes vastly outweigh the effects of genetic evolution during that period
3640766 the court of appeal to day delivered judgment in this important case the master of the rolls in this case the appellant was a mrs fardell a woman who while navigating a motor launch on the river thames collided with the respondent who was navigating a punt as a result of which the respondent was immersed and caught cold the respondent brought an action for damages in which it was alleged that the collision and subsequent immersion were caused by the negligent navigation of the appellant in the court below the learned judge decided that there was evidence on which the jury might find that the defendant had not taken reasonable care and being of that opinion very properly left to the jury the question whether in fact she had failed to use reasonable care or not the jury found for the plaintiff and awarded him two hundred and fifty pounds damages this verdict we are asked to set aside on the ground of misdirection by the learned judge the contention being that the case should never have been allowed to go to the jury and this contention is supported by a somewhat novel proposition which has been ably though tediously argued by sir ethelred rutt the appeals judge the common law of england has been laboriously built about a mythical figure the figure of the reasonable man in the field of jurisprudence this legendary individual occupies the place which in another science is held by the economic man and in social and political discussions by the average or plain man he is an ideal a standard the embodiment of all those qualities which we demand of the good citizen no matter what may be the particular department of human life which falls to be considered in these courts sooner or later we have to face the question was this or was it not the conduct of a reasonable man did the defendant take such care to avoid shooting the plaintiff in the stomach as might reasonably be expected of a reasonable man moocat v radley 1883 2 q b did the plaintiff take such precautions to inform himself of the circumstances as any reasonable man would expect of an ordinary person having the ordinary knowledge of an ordinary person of the habits of wild bulls when goaded with garden forks and the persistent agitation of red flags williams v dogbody 184l 2 a c i need not multiply examples it is impossible to travel anywhere or to travel for long in that confusing forest of learned judgments which constitutes the common law of england without encountering the reasonable man he is at every turn an ever present help in time of trouble and his apparitions mark the road to equity and right there has never been a problem however difficult which his majestys judges have not in the end been able to resolve by asking themselves the simple question was this or was it not the conduct of a reasonable man and leaving that question to be answered by the jury this noble creature stands in singular contrast to his kinsman the economic man whose every action is prompted by the single spur of selfish advantage and directed to the single end of monetary gain the reasonable man is always thinking of others prudence is his guide and safety first if i may borrow a contemporary catchword is his rule of life all solid virtues are his save only that peculiar quality by which the affection of other men is won for it will not be pretended that socially he is much less objectionable than the economic man though any given example of his behaviour must command our admiration when taken in the mass his acts create a very different set of impressions he is one who invariably looks where he is going and is careful to examine the immediate foreground before he executes a leap or bound who neither star gazes nor is lost in meditation when approaching trap doors or the margin of a dock who records in every case upon the counterfoils of cheques such ample details as are desirable scrupulously substitutes the word order for the word bearer crosses the instrument a c payee only and registers the package in which it is despatched who never mounts a moving omnibus and does not alight from any car while the train is in motion who investigates exhaustively the bona fides of every mendicant beggar before distributing alms and will inform himself of the history and habits of a dog before administering a caress who believes no gossip nor repeats it without firm basis for believing it to be true who never drives his ball till those in front of him have definitely vacated the putting green which is his own objective who never from one years end to another makes an excessive demand upon his wife his neighbours his servants his ox or his ass who in the way of business looks only for that narrow margin of profit which twelve men such as himself would reckon to be fair contemplates his fellow merchants their agents and their goods with that degree of suspicion and distrust which the law deems admirable who never swears gambles or loses his temper who uses nothing except in moderation and even while he flogs his child is meditating only on the golden mean i have called him a myth and in so far as there are few if any of his mind and temperament to be found in the ranks of living men the title is well chosen but it is a myth which rests upon solid and even it may be upon permanent foundations the reasonable man is fed and kept alive by the most valued andenduring of our juridical institutions the common jury hateful as he must necessarily be to any ordinary citizen who privately considers him it is a curious paradox that where two or three are gathered together in one place they will with one accord pretend an admiration for him and when they are gathered together in the formidable surroundings of a british jury they are easily persuaded that they themselves are each and generally reasonable men without stopping to consider how strange a chance it must have been that has picked fortuitously from a whole people no fewer than twelve examples of a species so rare they immediately invest themselves with the attributes of the reasonable man and are therefore at one with the courts in their anxiety to support the tradition that such a being in fact exists thus it is that while the economic man has under the stress of modern conditions almost wholly disappeared from view his reasonable cousin has gained in power with every case in which he has figured to return however as every judge must ultimately return to the case which is before us it has been urged for the appellant and my own researches incline me to agree that in all that mass of authorities which bears upon this branch of the law there is no single mention of a reasonable woman it was ably insisted before us that such an omission extending over a century and more of judicial pronouncements must be something more than a coincidence that among the innumerable tributes to the reasonable man there might be expected at least some passing reference to a reasonable person of the opposite sex that no such reference is found for the simple reason that no such being is contemplated by the law that legally at least there is no reasonable woman and that therefore in this case the learned judge should have directed the jury that while there was evidence on which they might find that the defendant had not come up to the standard required of a reasonable man her conduct was only what was to be expected of a woman as such it must be conceded at once that there is merit in this contention however unpalatable it may at first appear the appellant relies largely on baxters case 1639 2 bole at page 100 in which it was held that for the purposes of estover the wife of a tenant by the mesne was at law in the same position as an ox or other cattle demenant to which a modern parallel may be found in the statutory regulations of many railway companies whereby for the purposes of freight a typewriter is counted as a musical instrument it is probably no mere chance that in our legal text books the problems relating to married women are usually considered immediately after the pages devoted to idiots and lunatics indeed there is respectable authority for saying that at common law this was the status of a woman recent legislation has whittled away a great part of this venerable conception but so far as concerns the law of negligence which is our present consideration i am persuaded that it remains intact it is no bad thing that the law of the land should here and there conform with the known facts of every day experience the view that there exists a class of beings illogical impulsive careless irresponsible extravagant prejudiced and vain free for the most part from those worthy and repellent excellences which distinguish the reasonable man and devoted to the irrational arts of pleasure and attraction is one which should be as welcome and as well accepted in our courts as it is in our drawing rooms and even in parliament the odd stipulation is often heard there that some new committee or council shall consist of so many persons one of which must be a woman the assumption being that upon scientific principles of selection no woman would be added to a body having serious deliberative functions that assumption which is at once accepted and resented by those who maintain the complete equality of the sexes is not founded as they suppose in some prejudice of man but in the considered judgments of nature i find that at common law a reasonable woman does not exist the contention of the respondent fails and the appeal must be allowed costs to be costs in the action above and below but not costs in the case bungay l f and blow l f concurred

3640769 there is a rich tradition of involvement by private foundations and individual donors in supporting dissidents opposition movements and alternative media in countries suffering under dictatorships unfortunately this tradition appears to have waned with the end of the cold war with the exception of george soros and the open society institute there is no bill gates of democracy promotion in fact given the internets claim to be a force for free expression and the wide dissemination of ideas the spread of freedom would seem a natural cause for the relatively youthful billionaires in the information technology community

3640817 yes this is another tool among many but what is lacking with us as
3640818 the state may ratify the treaty of lisbon signed at lisbon on the 13th day of december 2007 and may be a member of the european union established by virtue of that treaty
3640819 mr mulhall said there was a sense with the lisbon tretay that the european union wanted to settle its institutional affairs and move on to deal with the real agenda
3640820 the state may ratify the treaty of lisbon signed at lisbon on the 13th day of december 2007 and may be a member of the european union established by virtue of that treaty
3640821 public opinion will be led to adopt without knowing it the proposals that we dare not present to them directly all the earlier proposals will be in the new text but will be hidden and disguised in some way
3640822 france was just ahead of all the other countries in voting no it would happen in all member states if they have a referendum there is a cleavage between people and governments a referendum now would bring europe into danger there will be no treaty if we had a referendum in france which would again be followed by a referendum in the uk
3640823 the difference between the original constitution and the present lisbon treaty is one of approach rather than content the proposals in the original constitutional treaty are practically unchanged they have simply been dispersed through the old treaties in the form of amendments why this subtle change above all to head off any threat of referenda by avoiding any form of constitutional vocabulary but lift the lid and look in the toolbox all the same innovative and effective tools are there just as they were carefully crafted by the european convention
3640824 sometimes i like to compare the eu as a creation to the organisation of empires we have the dimension of empire but there is a great difference empires were usually made with force with a centre imposing diktat a will on the others now what we have is the first non imperial empire
3640825 public opinion will be led to adopt without knowing it the proposals that we dare not present to them directly all the earlier proposals will be in the new text but will be hidden and disguised in some way
3640826 the most striking change between the eu constitution in its older and newer version is perhaps that in order to enable some governments to reassure their electorates that the changes will have no constitutional implications the idea of a new and simpler treaty containing all the provisions governing the union has now been dropped in favour of a huge series of individual amendments to two existing treaties virtual incomprehensibility has thus replaced simplicity as the key approach to eu reform as for the changes now proposed to be made to the constitutional treaty most are presentational changes that have no practical effect they have simply been designed to enable certain heads of government to sell to their people the idea of ratification by parliamentary action rather than by referendum
3640827 the substance of the constitution is preserved that is a fact
3640828 90 per cent of it is still there these changes havent made any dramatic change to the substance of what was agreed back in 2004
3640829 the aim of the constitutional treaty was to be more readable the aim of this treaty is to be unreadable the constitution aimed to be clear whereas this treaty had to be unclear it is a success
3640830 the good thing about not calling it a constitution is that no one can ask for a referendum on it
3640831 if its a yes we will say on we go and if its a no we will say we continue
3640832 the constitution is the capstone of a european federal state
3640833 the evidence of practice since may 2004 suggests that the eus institutional processes and practice have stood up rather robustly to the impact of enlargement

3640861 we and the mdc headed by mutambara have signed the agreement
3640862 tsvangirai did not sign the agreement because he is basically trying to take us back to renegotiate issues that we had already agreed on we are proceeding and the president is going to form a government of national unity including members of the opposition
3640863 gigantic experiment i think with nature and the whole of humanity which has gone seriously wrong
3640864 why else are we facing all these challenges climate change and everything
3640865 that would be the absolute destruction of everything and the classic way of ensuring there is no food in the future
3640866 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out

3640876 frank and i have been jaycees for more than 40 years and he was an excellent leader and model jaycee
3640877 he was a warm and voluble person who used his gifts as a salesman in all of his activities in the community
3640878 we go back a long way frank was very hardworking perceptive and had a good political mind
3640879 and he was always chewing on a damn cigar and usually had a big smile on his face
3640880 he worked hard and well with the staff and during campaigns didnt mind doing the dirtiest or fanciest of work from planting signs on lawns or administrative work
3640881 frank was a team player with his people and wanted to make things happen he was always positive about his work and getting it done
3640882 he was one of the most honest bureaucrats which is a word that comes hard for me because i really dont like bureaucrats
3640883 frank never had an agenda and did what he was supposed to do and did it very well

3640979 importante mostrar a ge rgia sob um prisma positivo agora

3640982 image quality is also surprisingly good the lens is the weakest link but even this performs reasonably well with good centre and edge sharpness awith only a small amount of barrel distortion although it does suffer from noticeable chromatic aberration in the corners of the frame at wide angle colour reproduction is very good and captures highlights in bright colours better than some cameras ive seen recently the exposure system does tend to sacrifice highlight detail in favour of shadow detail resulting in some burned out highlights but on the whole it copes well with a wide range of conditions
3640983 in summation it is fair to suggest the gx 20 is not an entry level unit it has clearly been designed with the intermediate to advanced user in mind who is familiar with the general controlling functions and handling of a dslr the lack of scene modes and the detailed menu function information help to define the target customer as an experienced camera user capable of fully controlling the gx 20 as opposed to it automatically controlling the look of images with point and shoot operation
3640984 they initially opted for a break hoping a trial split might make them stronger sadly it doesnt seem to have worked john took the decision to end things as he felt he just wasnt ready for the level of commitment that jennifer deserved
3640985 contrary to reports jen didnt want to have kids or marry this year but she did want to set a timetable for their future together
3640986 they have spoken on the phone since the split and are trying to remain on good terms but unless john has a dramatic change of heart its unlikely theyll rekindle their romance
3640987 i became aware that kris could qualify for scotland a few months ago
3640988 i saw a lot of him when i was manager of derby and he was at nottingham forest
3640989 he transferred to derby in the summer and i had him watched
3640990 i think he will give us a different dimension he is a boy with a lot of ability he is naturally left sided and maybe we have lacked width in the squad
3640991 i spoke to the boy and he was keen and enthusiastic to join the squad
3640992 callum is an experienced player who has played for scotland in the past
3640993 he did very well for preston and i watched him in a pre season game against motherwell
3640994 he is fit and injury free and this is an opportunity to look at him
3640995 darren barr is one for the future he was involved with the b squad last year and he is still finding his way
3640996 but this was another good opportunity to bring a young player in
3640997 they filled with water the main thing is that i dont think they were tight enough it is her responsibility
3640998 its like when ian thorpe got in at the olympic trials he got disqualified its down to him its one of those things
3640999 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3641000 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3641001 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3641002 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3641003 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3641004 you come to great states like wa and you just see the development bursting at the seams
3641005 its a state which has seen such strong economic growth in recent years and all that comes at a price people have to have places to live suburbs in which to build their homes
3641006 its good to see the state government here under alans leadership with a forward visionary plan on how to deal with urban congestion and public transport
3641007 these are places nobodys gone before in essence so this is a first step
3641008 it was bad for the arctic but very very good for mapping
3641009 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3641010 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3641011 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3641012 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3641013 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3641014 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3641015 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3641016 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3641017 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3641021 there are no obvious reasons why the banks wouldnt pass through any change in the cash rate
3641022 funding environment is quite different even in the past few weeks
3641023 the reason this is so significant at present is that customer deposits only account for around 50 per cent of bank funding
3641024 the gap between the cash rate and money market rates is much wider than the historical average and is not showing any sign of easing the new reality is that movements in cash rates set by central banks are no longer a reasonable guide to the cost of bank funding
3641025 the average cost of funds the money that banks have borrowed on domestic and international markets to lend their customers is increasing
3641026 the situation changed over the last couple of weeks with the impact of statements that came out of melbourne with regard to a couple of banks nab anz and their respective positions which has had some impact internationally on the reputation of australian banks and the ability to access international funding markets
3641027 the rba talks to the banks via hotline no doubt and they probably have a good feel as to how the banks will respond given the 50 basis points cut call was largely predicated on the commercial banks not passing anything on the rba can probably stick to 25 basis points in september
3641028 obviously they the rba would like to see the banks fully pass it on whether they do or not is completely up to the banks

3641049 i gave it my best shot and thats all i can do
3641050 my plan was to go out fast yesterday i went out easier and my coach said i should go out faster and i think im back to my normal self
3641051 ive gone out under world record pace before i died a lot on the last length and on the last few metres my arms were really struggling
3641052 all the indications are they want to kill police there is no intelligence at all to suggest they want to currently kill anyone other than police if innocent ordinary people get in the way they would have no issue they dont care its just not what their tactics are the notion theyve got any moral position is non existent
3641053 they are badly disrupted by our activity over 40 arrested this year on various operations
3641054 with absolute certainty that the provos are not engaged in any terrorist activity
3641055 level of awfulness that we havent even conceived of yet
3641056 whats quite interesting is the determination of cops not to be put off what they are doing its consistent
3641057 the police federation has been very clear we werent frightened 30 years ago were not going to be frightened of these people now
3641058 we are seeing dissident republicans currently at the top end of activity in my experience here
3641059 for up to a year now ive been saying my major concern is dissident republicans
3641060 but as in the history of the past we dont know everything and as a consequence of quite determined attempts to kill police officers in four incidents show they have some capability and some capacity
3641061 all the indications are they want to kill police there is no intelligence at all to suggest they want to currently kill anyone other than police if innocent ordinary people get in the way they would have no issue they dont care its just not what their tactics are the notion theyve got any moral position is non existent
3641062 weve got a reasonable grip on them we are determined to deal with them
3641063 young disenfranchised people who are seeking something to do in life that gives them a sort of awful credibility
3641064 they want to recruit more people and they see killing cops as a way of recruiting more people
3641065 the people they are recruiting are hugely vulnerable young people who i suspect more competent groups wouldnt want to touch with a barge pole again it doesnt make them less dangerous sometimes it makes them more dangerous
3641066 they are in their death throes is how ive described it
3641067 i think there will come a point in time where people have just got so sick of them we see that but the end game is always going to be messy and this is one of those
3641068 no one has gone public to say the army council has gone away so its right to assume it still exists
3641069 what i can say with absolute certainty is that in terms of pira activity that is to say terrorist activity its not happening
3641070 does it mean all the provos have gone into nine to five jobs of course it doesnt there are some involved in organised crime without a doubt but operating as individuals not operating as an organisation and i think thats the key distinguishing factor
3641071 on the other side of course it must be hugely frustrating to those who dont have that confidence its easy to deny if someone is killed by someone who is inextricably linked to provos for someone to say it wasnt authorised its quite an easy thing to say
3641072 so i can understand i think the unionist community are going to look for a lot more than just a statement that pira have gone away before they are satisfied but we are not seeing activity
3641073 lets not forget one of the first convictions for an international terrorist offence was abbas boutrab here
3641074 so we have to make sure that northern ireland does not feel too comfortable and think we are not in the loop weve an international land border here which no other police force in the uk has
3641075 no doubt some people will claim that these proposals are unworkable unreasonable and perhaps plain barmy
3641076 but the issue is clear internal migration has always been an important part of a dynamic economy
3641077 if we are to ensure that people in this country have similar opportunities regardless of where they are born we need to allow people to move from places with few prospects to places that offer more opportunities
3641078 all towns and cities should have the right to determine their own policies and their local councils should be assessed regularly and accurately and the results of such assessment explained to local people
3641079 freedom responsibility and accountability are the keys to unlocking the potential that exists in our towns and cities

3641120 discerning travellers expect the highest level of service and comfort the choices we have made for transport experiences accommodation and food and nz wine ensure that these are all inclusive in the tour thus providing maximum value for money
3641121 we are the first to do this on a sustainable platform with our coaches rated by vehicle testing new zealand as the cleanest running tour coaches in country and all of them fitted out with re cycling bins this means our customers can enjoy their vacation knowing that we are doing our up most to protect what they have largely come to experience the new zealand environment
3641122 the effort that tim and his team have put into promoting and spreading the word about these first and best in class tours is commendable it has been exciting challenging and incredibly hard work but the rewards are emerging in the form of excellent customer feedback and a strengthening forward booking pattern
3641123 like many new ventures we have experienced and felt pretty much every emotion from the excitement of launching through some disappointments to the satisfaction from our first bookings and receiving exceptional customer feedback all of which leaves us very optimistic about the future
3641124 in the end we will judge our success by our team spirit the new zealand luxury vacations and tour experiences we deliver the level of customers satisfaction we provide and the financial returns to the shareholders who have been so supportive in the launch of our company

3641136 i went into this competition different than any other competition ive done where i knew that i was already here i earned my spot at the olympics and now it was all for me
3641137 i didnt want to come here and me be the only one to lift and not give it everything i had
3641138 he was here to support me i needed to make some lifts i wanted to be happy i wanted him to be happy for me
3641139 you could tell she was out there having a good time and lifting her heart out
3641140 i was just thinking to myself this is the last lift girl you do this
3641141 thats what i kept telling myself dont let yourself be disappointed after youre done with this no matter happens if i make two lifts or six lifts whatever i just wanted to leave with a smile and i did exactly that
3641142 i was filled with just sheer joy knowing it was the last one of the sign up for our breaking sports alerts and weekly e newsletter

3641145 i think everyone is wearing the suit now so were on kind of a level playing field
3641146 technology in all sports keeps advancing i think sports kind of have to keep up with that technology its a great suit i love it
3641147 hopefully our sport stays that way certainly no one wants to lose to a suit we swim the race against the athletes next to us not the technology
3641148 personally i dont have any positive test to back it up but yes i think doping exists
3641149 the sport has become entertainment and its taken on the morals of entertainment we rely on an inadequate doping agency for the proof youre innocent until proven guilty the key word being proven it can be very depressing for clean athletes

3641167 thats not something were going to do in an emergency with willis situation it helps us it gives us some depth that we didnt have
3641168 youve got to be able to put yourself in those situations as a kicker theres nothing that can replicate that other than a game and thats as close as you can get in fact i think that was worse than kicking a game winner because you dont want to let your guys down

3641189 things will be finalised today it will be a government of national consensus
3641190 efforts for a consensus government were still on in spite of the dispute between the maoists and the nepali congress over the defense portfolio
3641191 the passage to the formation of the next government should not be obstructed even if the nepali congress continues with its claim to the defense ministry
3641192 no programme has yet been fixed for a meeting of the left constituents with the cm yet if such a meeting comes up we would try to convince the cm of the urgency of the tripartite dialogue on the darjeeling dialogue
3641193 the sooner the dialogue takes place the better the chief minister must take the initiative and prevail over the centre a delay however inadvertent may aggravate the problem further
3641194 mr bhattacharya is well aware of the ground situation in the hills and so we are confident that he would listen to our appeal to take the initiative on the matter
3641195 if a meeting takes place with the cm my party would definitely ask him to use his influence with the centre to hold the tripartite dialogue at the earliest
3641196 those resisting are failing to realise the good sides of the package instead they are holding up the project
3641197 we are trying our utmost to convince the reluctant of the urgency of starting the project and are hopeful of a positive outcome
3641198 if the resistance continues we would be left with no other option but to return the amount to the centre
3641199 over 90 per cent of the people whose land has been acquired have agreed to our proposal and everything would become normal in no time
3641200 innovation technology and current medical practice all factor into the outcome of this study application of an expert interview system specifically targeted to erectile dysfunction along with a continuous platform for patient client physician communications make this particular internet system comparable to traditional medical practice
3641201 consider using the regulatory model of oversight protections implemented by the state of utah to license internet prescribing companies
3641202 a magnificent indication to all that nobody is above the law
3641203 gigantic experiment i think with nature and the whole of humanity which has gone seriously wrong
3641204 why else are we facing all these challenges climate change and everything
3641205 that would be the absolute destruction of everything and the classic way of ensuring there is no food in the future
3641206 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out
3641207 if they think this is the way to go we will end up with millions of small farmers all over the world being driven off their land into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness

3641211 in terms of the number of students who are ready this year compared to last we are talking about genuine progress
3641212 more students are reaching at least a minimum level of readiness for college credit courses were keeping a lot of kids from having to take remedial level courses that translates to millions of dollars that are being saved at the state level
3641213 we have a more heterogeneous population of test takers so were including those kids who werent considering college or arent considering college

3641229 we are entering a new phase if they conduct an investigation on the assumption that there are survivors
3641230 they could make what they do look great if they showed results in the probe into the abductions and at the same time come up with the right moves on the nuclear issue

3641245 you have to wonder when they look at what they consider a loophole with such excitement
3641246 that would suggest manipulating the process and i think opens the door to suspicion
3641247 the prospect of someone coming in with no id and registering and voting is contrary to every sort of protection that legislators and lawmakers have built into this system for decades
3641248 the processes and the law and the systems in our 88 counties are not equipped to handle same day registration
3641249 this is one of many ways well be encouraging our supporters to skip the lines on election day and make sure their vote is cast early
3641250 instructions are being developed and being sent to boards of election across the state to make sure voting is consistent
3641251 there is no question that the huge effort to register and turn out voters at ohio state university is going to have a positive impact on our race

3641254 es war sehr emotional und ein gro es erlebnis es herrschte bei den menschen eine urspr ngliche begeisterung
3641255 i had said that if i won another medal i would climb the wall thats why i braked
3641256 my left leg was pulling today particular on the climb i had it massaged but it didnt help
3641257 i had never been as well prepared for the olympic games
3641258 but the voice heard by the crowd and by a worldwide television audience estimated to be in the billions was that of 7 year old yang peiyi who was pulled from the performance after the final dress rehearsal because she did not have the right look a senior official said
3641259 photos of peiyi on a blog by her tutor show a typically pretty girl in a white dress with a pink clip in her hair she appears to be losing her milk teeth and her two front teeth are only partially grown at slightly awkward angles
3641260 i dont agree with the decision because they are kids and it may scar them for life
3641261 i think the girl with the voice should have a chance to perform at the closing ceremonies it would be a great chance for her to redeem herself to the world
3641262 more ire was directed at the organizers for not going public with the decision rather than at miaoke whose performance was highly praised immediately after the opening ceremony
3641263 all these players whove gone abroad its a loss of talent for the team but its also a source of pride for chinese people
3641264 were representing singapore and even though were chinese when we play we give it our all
3641265 anyhow were just not capable of posing a threat against china
3641266 this is just going to help us to make the next generation stronger to build up a very solid system domestically

3641269 die kontrolle ber die medien ist absolut existentiell in jedem krieg kriege werden nicht mehr auf dem schlachtfeld gewonnen sondern mit der unterst tzung der ffentlichen meinung
3641270 in jedem krieg lernen die konfliktparteien hinzu wie sie die medien unauff llig instrumentalisieren und mit welchen informationen sie sie f ttern k nnen
3641271 verl ssliche informationen ber aktuelle entwicklungen und reale opferzahlen zu bekommen
3641272 um sich selbst ein bild vom ausma der zerst rung zu machen
3641273 in modernen kriegen ist die zahl der verletzten durchschnittlich drei mal h her als die der toten
3641274 niemand kennt die genauen opferzahlen aber sie d rfte wesentlich niedriger liegen als von russland behauptet
3641275 ich habe erwartet dass es schwierig sein wird die fakten zu erfahren
3641276 doch momentan habe ich keinerlei vertrauen in jegliche informationen die die regierungen verbreiten
3641277 viele georgische web seiten sind seit tagen nicht mehr erreichbar schuld sollen russische hacker sein

3641285 nu papa dood is gaan jullie toch wel verder met zijn verhalen
3641286 juist de laatste twee jaar gaf hij aan dat hij vond dat hij het wel eens rustiger aan mocht doen
3641287 soms ben ik ook wel klaar met heul dat gedoe zei hij dan in zijn mooie brabants het boek is door een wreed toeval af het is voorbij door een granaat in georgi stan stierf in het harnas dag lieve stan ik zal je zo ontzettend missen
3641288 ongelooflijk zo vaak als hij is bedreigd met een kalasjnikov of een pistool op zijn hoofd hij wist welke risicos hij nam stan was geen cowboy al zijn ervaringen moesten worden weggeschreven
3641289 stan kwam bij ons werken in 1989 bij de start van rtl veronique het latere rtl4 hij heeft ons nooit verlaten geen dag dat was stan ik werkte voor het eerst uitgebreid met hem in za re om de revolutie tegen president mobutu te verslaan daar zag ik stan vier jaar jonger dan ik in vol ornaat grof gebekt gedreven ordinair professioneel met oog voor elk detail en boven alles betrouwbaar we hebben door de jaren heen de hele wereld over gereisd en alles meegemaakt onder de sterren geslapen in ethiopi en afghanistan goudenmedaillewinnaars ge nterviewd in salt lake city en aardbevingslachtoffers in marokko opgezocht
3641290 het was een bloednuchtere jongen ik herinner nog dat ik in bagdad zat te wachten op een cameraman stan was de enige die de juiste papieren had met zijn autootje volgepropt met al zijn spullen reed hij in zijn uppie dwars door de woestijn naar bagdad toen hij bij me aankwam grapte hij h conny wanneer gaat het nou eigenlijk eens beginnen hier stan was precies gearriveerd in die paar uur dat er niet geschoten werd in de stad hij was een nieuwsverslaafde cameraman maar beslist geen onbezonnen jongen
3641291 geen hoofdredacteur dwingt ons op pad te gaan we nemen ter plekke zelf de beslissing ik zit al 25 jaar in het vak en heb al ontelbare keren gedacht waar ben ik nou weer in beland we weten dat er risicos aan verbonden zijn en het zou me verbazen als hij daarover niet thuis sprak met zijn vrouw marjolein misschien zelfs met zijn kinderen
3641292 van marrakech tot belgrado van een item over speeltoestellen tot een liveverslag van een terreuraanslag op de kwaliteit van stan kan ik altijd rekenen
3641293 met stan storimans heb je als verslaggever goud in huis hartstochtelijk nieuwsdier en uitmuntend technicus die letterlijk op alle fronten ingezet kan worden
3641294 stan was niet alleen een zeer ervaren cameraman maar ook een uitermate geliefde collega we zullen alles in het werk stellen om stan en jeroen zo snel mogelijk terug naar nederland te halen uiteraard blazen we de najaarspresentatie af het zou zeer ongepast zijn om door te gaan
3641295 ik wil weten of er sprake is van een oorlogshandeling die tegen niemand in het bijzonder was gericht of dat er bewust is geschoten op de verslaggevers
3641296 ik werd vanochtend gebeld door pauline broekema het afschuwelijke nieuws trof me als een bliksemschicht toch hoort dit soort risicos bij dergelijke operaties ik vind het ook vreselijk voor jeroen akkermans wat die man allemaal heeft moeten meemaken hij is een van de beste tv verslaggevers die ik ken hij nam nooit onnodige risicos maar een mortieraanval hoor je niet aankomen een tankgranaat komt gierend op je af maar als je de explosie van een mortier hoort ben je te laat
3641297 vooral supermarkten dicht bij huis realiseren een hogere omzet ook bakkers slagers en buurtwinkels hebben er voordeel van dat de benzine zo duur is
3641298 maar als ze dat wel doen rijden ze daar niet minder kilometers voor
3641299 im telling you those two its ridiculous the bad luck theyve been encountering
3641300 if you had known michael before he was a very articulate smart young man with a lot of potential
3641301 but during treatment hes not allowed to be left alone not even for a minute he may need blood transfusions
3641302 she cant take care of him and an active toddler
3641303 i just so hope the department of housing will find them a house just a little bit handier to the family
3641304 i just dont see how im going to be able to take care of mike and the kids and the baby
3641305 were working as hard as possible with the housing authority to accommodate them and try to get them a home closer to the windsor hantsport area
3641306 this is a bit of an extra special case with the assistance that heather is going to need
3641307 were doing everything we can to find a place that will suit them
3641308 im hopeful that well be able to help them out

3641314 its already high enough you can increase it as much as you want
3641315 extensive bruising on the left side of the face from the forehead to the neck the lower side of the right face the right wrist the left forearm the right hip and the right shoulder which also had open wounds
3641316 i want to tell the truth and own up to what i did
3641317 i dont know why i did this other than to say that im an idiot
3641318 i know that i should have stopped them but i didnt
3641319 hoewel iedereen het recht heeft om een herkansing te doen om eventueel cijfers op te krikken zag mijn dochter hiervan af ze was inmiddels geslaagd en dit diploma was voldoende voor haar vervolgopleiding
3641320 er was een fout gemaakt latoya kwam wat tienden tekort maar de herexamens waren dus al geweest hoewel de school in eerste instantie wel de hand in eigen boezem wilde steken en mijn dochter haar diploma wilde geven is dit teruggefloten door de onderwijsinspectie
3641321 als direct duidelijk was geweest dat ze niet voldoende punten had gehaald was de kans dus groter dat ze uiteindelijk haar diploma zou krijgen dan nu het geval is
3641322 if anything i said can be interpreted as sexist i unequivocally and wholeheartedly apologize and withdraw my comments
3641323 i have always been a strong supporter of women in politics and want to encourage not hinder their participation in the public sphere
3641324 if they wanted to take me out i would think youd get someone whos looking forward to building a political career not somebody whos at the age where hes considering retirement
3641325 seeing the reaction of people today it would seem my comments were reflecting on the larger group or women in general and that was not the intention of my comment so i thought the only way to put it to bed was to issue an apology and retraction
3641326 when you live in a fish bowl you gotta watch how you swim
3641327 stephane dion must show that these comments are not acceptable in the political process and immediately reprimand his caucus members
3641328 its upsetting and ridiculous to hear this from an elected official
3641329 it should never have happened in the first place there has to be a direct apology to marjory lebreton and i just think its an assault on those who are running and those who would think about running
3641330 why didnt rona ambrose speak out when peter mackay called belinda stronach a dog
3641331 i think its kind of short sighted on her part or anyone elses to insist that thibault be reprimanded
3641332 these reforms will help more aboriginal people plan deliver and evaluate health programs and services with the goal of improving the health and well being of our first nations people in nova scotia
3641333 our chiefs are very confident that by working together these projects will address some of the priorities and issues facing first nations people
3641334 if this kind of co operation continues all i can see is success success success
3641335 we want to look very closely at what causes diabetes among our people to see what prevention policy we could put in place to lower the rate
3641336 i recall my days as health minister one of the big challenges we had was making people aware of their need to get involved in their own health care
3641337 the projects are designed to meet those challenges specifically how do we create the awareness within the community and also within the health care delivery system how do we ensure that we are fully aware of the challenges and are able to respond to those challenges
3641338 this is to work with first nations and the provinces to integrate the health care delivery system so that we dont let things fall through the cracks
3641339 id like to hear that theyre actually going to be training aboriginal students
3641340 i dont find that theres much support here for aboriginal students to be getting into the health care professions
3641341 in the absence of other assurances to secure adequate emergency response coverage for nova scotians in the event of a work interruption or strike we see discussion of this topic as our right and perhaps even our obligation to the public
3641342 you cannot go forward in the health industry without spending a dime
3641343 i believe in this round of negotiations more so than any other round the paramedics of this province are greatly united in standing together for what theyve been trying to get since 1997
3641344 the light sticks had failed over the course of the swim and they were no longer bright enough for the crew to see me and i couldnt see the boat so that was incredibly dangerous
3641345 i was seeing trees without leaves and up in the sky i was seeing giant grey sunflowers
3641346 it was really hard to get out of the water being able to see the p e i shore
3641347 i saw so many inexperienced teachers mostly women who became teachers because the system pushed them that way when they couldnt achieve academic standards to enter secondary schools
3641348 teaching is my passion a profession i chose because i wanted it it frustrated me that those who couldnt advance their education became teachers they try hard and are good people but they didnt choose their profession it was their only option theyre given a couple of months training and thrown into a school the kids are dying to learn but arent being taught well and thats heartbreaking
3641349 they hit students with a stick for being late or forgetting to bring firewood i so wanted to make change i never hit one of my students in fact id reward those who were on time rather than punish those who were late
3641350 it took months for me to hold my hand out to a child in greeting and for them to realize i wasnt going to hit them if school became negative for them why would they bother to come
3641351 a male teacher attempted to explain to me that in africa thats just the way things are and you must accept that hitting is just easier given the numbers of students in each class
3641352 i think he was shocked when i said i was aware of many schools where hitting is unacceptable as a disciplinary practice i suggested it was his duty as a teacher to find an alternative to the stick needless to say he didnt expect nor appreciate my retort
3641353 i did see subtle changes in the teachers during my 10 months there in the way they taught and dealt with the kids i just hope it doesnt revert
3641354 many of these kids had never been to the town i took them shopping out to eat but wondered if showing them the outside world was a good thing
3641355 i like to think i gave them a right to choose what they wanted to do
3641356 id like to have canadian schools adopt a tanzanian school and assist however they can i taught 28 kids in ilkurot to paint something they had never done i brought 28 paintings back to my school in vancouver st johns school where the paintings will be auctioned off and then hung in the school
3641357 the masai taught me theres beauty and simplicity in their life theyre not structured which forces you to see moments and be less hung up on structure
3641358 i was torn when i left because i felt i was letting down the kids stopping the momentum i had started i now hope st johns school and other independent schools like st johns can make life better for these people
3641359 you know how concerned i was to be there at the beginning well i fell in love with ilkurot and hated to leave i learned as much from my students as i gave to them learned more than i left there
3641360 we had so much stored in our second floor archives that the weight was causing structural damage to our building
3641361 our first step in protecting our museum was to move some of our artifacts and archives out of the museum to storage locations in other parts of the community
3641362 the second was to hire impact performance group of new glasgow to develop a plan for us
3641363 it will mean that we will once again have all our artifacts and archives on the same site which will make it more convenient for researchers
3641364 it will also mean we will be able to get more of our artifacts on display
3641365 from the street you wont be able to see much of a change
3641366 you want to keep people speaking in gaelic for as long as possible
3641367 going around singing is great too but its not going to create more gaelic speakers and right now the language is struggling to survive
3641368 i just feel like its a part of who i am
3641369 when i listen to the music in gaelic i guess it just triggers something in me i cant explain it

3641374 and were all going to be living on it and carrying it in our pocket all day long
3641375 there is a phenomenal amount of piracy out there and we believe that the idea that 95 of content on the net is free is not sustainable we dont believe that society can allow the free consumption of content to persist
3641376 the spirit is right the team responded well as did the crowd so im satisfied
3641377 we need the two weeks of training before the second leg because as could be seen we arent continuously sharp yet but we were also quite tidy today
3641378 i think everybody knows you always have good days and bad days i just wish today was a good day
3641379 before they go out there i want them to believe in themselves and they all did
3641380 i didnt have to say anything to them even though they are very young they have a lot of experience as well and they have their own ways to learn from their own experiences and they used those ways
3641381 just shake it off thats all you can do shake it off
3641382 id love to see this whole thing filled like we did that one saturday
3641383 i thought coming in there would be nine to 10 true freshmen that would have an opportunity to play and thats probably going to be the case
3641384 theyve done enough to convince us they can contribute as freshmen as much mentally as physically
3641385 normally the biggest drawback from a freshman is can they handle the schemes the pace and all the things that go on with it
3641386 and those two have shown that they can so far theyre both fast explosive players that are good with the spread system as much as anything i like the way they practice normally a freshman comes in and you have to teach them the intensity of practice and these guys are obviously well coached in high school coming here in the summer months helped because theyve got a taste of coach mike barwis and the strength program in the summer
3641387 hopefully every year we recruit well enough that weve got guys good enough to compete
3641388 if you do that youre doing a good job recruiting
3641389 thats teachable they dont know what to look at sometimes and theyre scared to pull that trigger at times
3641390 you feel the whole picture what happens sometimes if you turn your head and just look for the ball you dont know what the sets are youre rushing a set the guys going to set different the hands are going to come at you differently its a feel
3641391 most of the time if youve got a veteran offensive line theyre going to move a hair before the ball is moved
3641392 its watching the knee for the most part but the vets are pretty good at getting some kind of twitch out of you its just something youve got to pick up learning the game
3641393 you have to anticipate him stepping up the guys not going to be an iron deer in the front lawn hes going to move
3641394 youve got to get the free ones and dunk them
3641395 it was mostly on the bad angle i thought the back was going to come and chip block on me or whatnot but he didnt i just went too wide its all about technique and getting a feel for the game
3641396 if i can get the first two steps faster whoa
3641397 obviously hes not dwight freeney but its the same kind of speed rush cut the corner dip real low
3641398 hes coming off the ball real good from what ive seen
3641399 the toughest thing is getting a good job out of him basically
3641400 i can assure you im not going to have zumaya for a while even if everything checks out all right
3641401 all i know is there is a problem joel is not himself i can see it in his face i can see it in his demeanor
3641402 right now i dont feel comfortable pitching joel im not talking about because of results im talking about because something is not right
3641403 its going to be next year until he gets back to 100
3641404 he got on top of a 96 m p h fastball
3641405 im not mad at brandon but thats not a good play
3641406 but at the same time that has nothing to do with scoring three runs and then giving up four
3641407 eso se observa tambi n en la patolog a sexual en la medida en que el var n quiere demostrar su potencia sin pensar en la compa era o ella intenta demostrar su capacidad de orgasmo pensando s lo en s misma y no en el compa ero en esa medida se vuelve ella fr gida y el impotente
3641408 he is a proven big league pitcher in a time in which its hard to find pitching
3641409 you want to be somewhere they want you theyve got good players and good fans
3641410 weve told dontrelle that our goal is that wed like him to be the big league pitcher hes capable of being in 2009 if its before that thats great
3641411 thats a great question its so far in advance i probably cant answer that
3641412 if hes himself would you like him to be in the rotation next year absolutely is it a slam dunk at this juncture its up in the air
3641413 i dont think you close any doors i think you see what it is
3641414 i can be in the outfield and play every day i dont want to dh i dont feel like a baseball player when i dh
3641415 the last thing were looking to do is create any controversy gary has always spoken how he feels he enjoys being fully engaged in the game and the position hes in now doesnt allow him to do that he enjoys participating in the outfield
3641416 is gary happy in detroit gary is happy where gary plays
3641417 he could get hurt again by diving for a ball
3641418 this home doesnt have a dedicated dining room space this wouldnt work for my family gatherings
3641419 if we go in there and get a big win over an opponent like that at their place that can be a springboard for us for the rest of the season
3641420 i think they have a history here of fattening everybody up after a so so season and saying great things are on the horizon
3641421 i think thats the natural progression here i think also the progression is they want to deflate you very quickly as well so well step up to the plate right away well step right in there the first game and get ready to play
3641422 we played a uab team a little bit better team bowling green a little bit better pitt team this year the cal game comes right up on us
3641423 i think thats a good thing to find out exactly who we are early in the first game and then we can play accordingly from that
3641424 ich konnte auf den letzten 100 m nichts mehr sehen weil sich die brille mit wasser gef llt hat
3641425 ich wollte zwar unter 1 52 minuten bleiben aber unter diesen umst nden war es nicht schlecht
3641426 it was one of many factors that contributed to better results
3641427 its not all layoffs its also just reconfiguring when people work and what time they work
3641428 people werent visiting our casino it didnt matter how few or how many staff we had the casino property itself was too large
3641429 we had to downsize the halifax facility physically and therefore obviously staff would lose their jobs because we werent having as many positions open
3641430 theres an anti gaming sentiment thats been promoted for a number of years
3641431 he had so many things wrong he stopped eating he just wanted to lay there
3641432 the area i live in is totally infested with raccoons
3641433 they run along the fences theyre in the garbage theyre in your yard they try to dig up plants
3641434 the most common cause is wildlife urinating and getting into stagnant water and then a dog coming along and drinking that water
3641435 it can actually go in and affect the liver and kidney
3641436 what we found is that the liver enzymes were right off the scale
3641437 you have to look at the risk factor of your own dog and decide whether you want to vaccinate or not or keep the animal on a leash so you know what theyre getting into
3641438 these are not tame animals theyre not supposed to be here in the numbers that they are
3641439 what a staff person would do is offer advice depending upon the information that they receive
3641440 our first advice always is to try to make it as easy as possible for animals and humans to co habitat
3641441 if they really want the animal removed then people have the choice of trapping the animals themselves
3641442 theyre certified to catch the animals and they charge a fee
3641443 we make those names available if people are looking for someone to do that
3641444 even if it is a confirmed diagnosis of leptospirosis the sources of that are numerous

3641470 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3641471 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3641472 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3641473 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3641474 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3641475 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3641476 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

3641533 the difference in mental health outcomes between child soldiers and never conscripted children can be explained in part by greater exposure to traumatic events among child soldiers especially for general psychological difficulties and function impairment
3641534 second girl soldiers may require focused attention possibly for factors not addressed in this study such as problems of sexual violence and reintegration difficulties third the variation in type and severity of mental health problems highlights the importance of screening including locally developed measures of function impairment as a base for intervention
3641535 without screening there is a risk of pathologizing child soldiers as a group rather than providing support to those individuals most impaired finally the presence of mental health problems among never conscripted children illustrates the need for comprehensive postconflict community based psychosocial care not restricted only to child soldiers

3641620 we tried to mimic swedish massage because anecdotally its the most popular technique used by athletes

3641645 we zijn nu in peking en ik heb er echt zin in dat is toch het belangrijkste
3641646 ik voel me goed ook mijn achillespezen zijn in orde al zeg ik dat niet graag want ze zijn wat wispelturig
3641647 ze spelen soms nog op maar dat is draaglijk het is geen probleem om te lopen
3641648 ik ben blij dat ik kon vertellen dat dit mijn laatste zomerseizoen is dat is nu toch van mn schouders gevallen
3641649 op het wk vorig jaar in osaka was het ook heel warm ik vind dat het hier nog gaat
3641650 ook met de zenuwen gaat het ik ben altijd nerveuzer in aanloop naar maar eens ik er ben en zie dat iedereen bezig is dan gaat het
3641651 onder meer de amerikanen en de jamaicanen hebben alweer heel snelle tijden neergezet maar dat trek ik me niet te veel aan hier is alles voor iedereen hetzelfde
3641652 in mn hoofd ben ik opnieuw klaar voor alle drie de afstanden ik moet natuurlijk afwachten hoe mijn lichaam reageert en we zullen het dag per dag bekijken maar ik zit in de beste vorm van het seizoen
3641653 maar hij kan me op sommige punten helpen zodat ik mij alleen op het voetbal moet concentreren en dat vind ik goed
3641654 de praktijk zal moeten uitwijzen wat ik zal doen priv zaken praktische dingen motivatie ook
3641655 als mbark me roept sta ik klaar de club moet op de hoogte zijn van wat er gebeurt we mogen hem niet aan zijn lot overlaten
3641656 ik ken mijn verantwoordelijkheid en weet dat ik meer moet kunnen brengen
3641657 wat er de voorbije weken is gebeurd kan ik moeilijk verteren ik weet dat ik mijn niveau nog niet haal frustrerend ik ben daar echt mee bezig
3641658 na interlands met marokko ben ik pas op 7 juli teruggekomen en na twee weken moet je al de belangrijkste match van het seizoen spelen dan kun je gewoon nog niet top zijn en ik ben zeker niet de enige in dat geval
3641659 het is zeker geen fysiek probleem maar voetballend zijn we nog aan het zoeken maar ik raak niet in paniek we gaan de goede vorm vinden
3641660 el objetivo de la operaci n para imponer la paz se ha cumplido la seguridad de las tropas de paz y de los ciudadanos rusos est garantizada
3641661 el agresor ha sido castigado y ha sufrido bajas significativas sus fuerzas armadas han quedado dispersas
3641662 la declaraci n del cese de las hostilidades por parte de rusia es una buena noticia
3641663 son buenos principios que permiten salir de la situaci n actual y que valen tanto para georgia como para osetia
3641664 hemos acordado respetar la soberan a de georgia es un pa s independiente
3641665 rusia reconoce la soberan a de georgia pero esto no significa que un estado soberano pueda hacer lo que le de la gana
3641666 lo mejor de la playa es el agua porque est muy limpia es cristalina y de color turquesa
3641667 es virgen pero al mismo tiempo est muy bien cuidado
3641668 por culpa del incivismo de los ba istas se encuentran residuos en la arena que no son agradables como pl sticos o restos de comida

3641672 el poco fr o invernal hizo que las enfermedades proliferaran m s de lo normal eso unido a las lluvias de mayo y junio plantean un descenso de la producci n de entre un 30 y un 40 de hecho hay racimos en el suelo que aunque con presencia no alcanzan la calidad de denominaci n esperada

3641675 ik sta scherp het is ook hier en nu dat je in topvorm moet zijn
3641676 ik moest lang wachten om zeker te zijn van mijn ticket maar het beste is er nog niet af ik heb al een constant seizoen achter de rug
3641677 ik droom wel van de finale al weet ik wel dat dat moeilijk wordt maar je moet op het hoogste mikken
3641678 ik hoop dat ik de finale kan halen maar dat wordt lastig er zijn 52 loopsters en maar 15 finaleplaatsen
3641679 ik hoop dat ik in een snelle reeks beland en anders zal ik proberen zelf tempo te maken ik denk er nog niet aan dat dit mijn laatste seizoen is
3641680 ik heb verschillende blessures gehad maar nu gaat het goed
3641681 ik mis wedstrijdritme en heb ook nog geen goede tijd achter mijn naam dit seizoen maar ik voel dat ik naar mijn topconditie toegroei
3641682 hay que felicitar a china por el partido que ha hecho no nos dej hacer nuestro juego pero cuando empezamos a presionar no nos supo atacar y nosotros supimos correr que es el tipo de juego en el que menos nos desenvolvemos
3641683 fue muy dif cil sobre todo en la primera parte porque no sali el juego habitual del equipo y china estuvo muy acertada al final en el tercer y en el ltimo cuartos empez la presi n que abri nuestra remontada
3641684 aunque fallamos la ltima posesi n hay que estar contentos de haber empatado para forzar la pr rroga tal y como hab a ido el partido era un buen resultado para nosotros
3641685 una mala mentalidad por pensar que el partido estaba ganado antes de jugarlo
3641686 empezamos con muy mala mentalidad porque nos dejamos envolver por el ambiente de que ganamos a grecia en el primer partido que china hab a perdido con los estados unidos y ya pens bamos que hab amos ganado a china salimos sin intensidad y eso nos dur todo el primer tiempo
3641687 lo que todos sabemos es que el se or rodr guez zapatero aprob un estatuto y ahora por lo que se ve no est dispuesto a cumplirlo y eso ha originado un problema grav simo dentro del psoe pero a mi no me preocupan los problemas del psoe sino que me preocupan los problemas de los espa oles
3641688 le pasa a quien act a como aprendiz de brujo
3641689 est metido en el problema y no sabe c mo salir
3641690 l es el presidente del gobierno y tiene que dar una soluci n
3641691 la sensaci n que se est transmitiendo es que el gobierno est absolutamente a la deriva
3641692 yo lo que le ofrezco al se or rodr guez zapatero es un consenso y un acuerdo en esta materia pero es su responsabilidad aceptar esta oferta que el partido popular le est haciendo
3641693 afecta a la propia estabilidad del psoe y por tanto a la propia estabilidad del gobierno en un momento de crisis econ mica
3641694 lo peor que nos puede pasar a todos los espa oles es que encima los apoyos del gobierno est n divididos
3641695 ha generado un l o muy importante dentro de su propio partido
3641696 le amenaza ahora con no apoyar los presupuestos generales del estado y hacer caer el gobierno
3641697 no era buena para los catalanes ni para el conjunto de espa a
3641698 y ahora continu el se or rodr guez zapatero con su actuaci n est enga ando a la gente una vez m s

3641700 we will end up with millions of small farmers all over the world being driven off their land into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness
3641701 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand
3641702 and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
3641703 huge salinisation problems i have been there seen it some of the excessive approaches to modern argriculture
3641704 genetic modification takes mankind into realms that belong to god and to god alone
3641705 pose a serious threat to biodiversity and our own health
3641706 er waren wel kandidaat overnemers maar die hadden een andere visie wij wilden kleinschalig werken en vooral service geven tegenwoordig is alles marketing
3641707 watch pm brown as he dithers over the most pressing issues of the day
3641708 oddly both sides claimed a victory the english because of their tactical superiority the dutch because the strategic goal of their attack the lifting of the blockade had been achieved

3641714 we had been through a lot over the last eight years
3641715 i just wanted to be out at the 50 metre point and thats where i was
3641716 i was in open water and it was difficult for the other guys to see me
3641717 thats why im glad finals are in the morning because you wake up you race and youre not sitting around thinking about it all day
3641718 i am overjoyed by the fact that i have brought joy to our dear general
3641719 we hate each other thats pretty much it its a great rivalry its going to be a great game and its the olympics so it just raises the bar that much more
3641720 dont write that thats a lie we love each other
3641721 no its a big rivalry obviously we play each other so often we know everything about each other so its going to be a little catty but its always a great game in the end
3641722 its a huge rivalry between them and us we get excited to play the u s all the time and now we get to do it in the olympics
3641723 obviously it would be ideal to knock them out in the olympics and not allow them a chance to win a medal
3641724 we hope were the big story of the games no canadian athletes have won a medal and we would like to win our next game and give us a pretty good shot at it
3641725 before we can look at that we have to focus on the u s and theyre probably the best team in the world we still have to beat them
3641726 i thought we played with really good energy in spurts and played some really terrific basketball
3641727 our goal wasnt to win by a certain margin it was to really work hard and keep up our pressure and then once that was done we just worked on a few other things
3641728 they know that were coming back to redeem ourselves and im pretty sure that they watch us a lot
3641729 hes a victim of his monstrous genetic mutation and therefore cannot be held accountable for his actions
3641730 so how long are you in town i know a great sushi place in weho
3641731 none of my coaches saw it when they watched the video they didnt see it
3641732 i didnt feel it thats for sure the judges saw something they didnt like and youve got to go with what they say
3641733 i made the final and i finished sixth at an olympics thats not bad but it wasnt why i came
3641734 losing funding and things like that i missed the last training camp here as a result and everyone ahead of me didnt so youve got those questions in the back of your head did i do everything i needed to do to be prepared here i did what i could with the resources i had
3641735 theres no reason that in four years ill be any less fit or strong than i am now
3641736 if we dove like we did at trials we would have won a medal
3641737 we were so close to a medal only our fourth dive cost us the bronze medal
3641738 today i really focused on the race and not the outcome
3641739 i was racing the girl in lane 2 and i knew i was in the game when i saw the girls behind me in the backstroke leg
3641740 hopefully well be able to get down and get on that podium
3641741 im pleased with the time but there are some technical parts of my race that didnt go quite as i had planned
3641742 it would have been good to get a medal but at the same time im really proud of what i did here my snatch was my best ever and my clean and jerk was good too
3641743 my snatch is not my best move so to be in the game i knew i had to do three good snatches i didnt want to try too much and miss so im pretty proud
3641744 i think it is due to the weather conditions the hot humid weather and rain i think from today there will be more spectators in the stadiums the tickets are sold out thats correct
3641745 many scalpers came to me but i couldnt afford the price for that price id rather stay at home and watch tv
3641746 from the tv broadcasts we can see lots of seats are empty
3641747 we cant afford that and people like us who really want to see the games cant get in
3641748 scalping is prohibited by chinese law and well look into this to see whether it is true or not
3641749 from the test events until now we have implemented measures to prevent the scalping of tickets thats all i can say
3641750 the putts that payne made on 16 and 18 showed what a great champion he is
3641751 they get in contention in a major and manage to get things going their way either because they play well or because somebody else comes back
3641752 and unfortunately it hasnt happened to me i feel like i played well enough to win probably more than two majors throughout my career
3641753 theres a lot of guys that have spent their entire life for this moment
3641754 everyones been training real hard i think its pretty cool that i get an opportunity to have a crack at it
3641755 im hoping it his shoulder is going to be good to go
3641756 australia is a good team we have to perform to our usual level for this game
3641757 i let a big third down play go early on i dropped one
3641758 after that i went to the sideline and told him it was my fault and i told him it wont happen again he knows that he trusts me and as you see he kept throwing the ball to me
3641759 after i came out a lot of guys were really positive about how i played which feels good
3641760 it feels good to know that i have the support of not only the management which i think has been proven in the public eye but the guys as well which is very important to me
3641761 the interception we couldve caught the ball a couple of dropped passes overall he played great he led the offence and thats all we can ask for
3641762 i am really enjoying training everyday with the first team it is what i want to do and where i want to be
3641763 the doctors told me im going to have to work really hard in rehab
3641764 its going to take a minimum of six months but the support and encouragement ive been shown by boxing nova scotia has been really uplifting
3641765 all parties to the conflict reportedly continue to use and recruit children
3641766 cultural issues related to the concepts of boyhood and manhood
3641767 both armed groups and community members are being reported as perpetrators of such violations
3641768 ending grave violations against children will not be possible unless significant progress is made in the political dimension
3641769 as a matter of priority the chadian authorities should also increase security and protection of the civilian populations in and around refugee camps and internally displaced person sites
3641770 i dont think united have another level to go to
3641771 they had a lot of players at the peak of their form for the last two years
3641772 rio ferdinand has been awesome for the last two years and cristiano ronaldo was unbelievable i dont think youll see that again
3641773 wayne rooney carlos tevez ryan giggs they have all been fantastic
3641774 i think we can close the gap because man united were at the very top of their game last season
3641775 but weve been very close to them and we had injuries and a change of manager
3641776 the new manager has come in and made a few changes hes made some great signings deco looks awesome so im excited to see him play
3641777 we need to start well and get off to a flyer just keep winning
3641778 man united have a few tough games early on liverpool have made some good signings and will be stronger this year we need to focus
3641779 we didnt have a great day today but we didnt need to we just wanted to go out and have some fun today
3641780 the first day of racing was really windy which was great because were really good in the heavy stuff
3641781 overall we were satisfied i wish wed ended on a better note though but it was good
3641782 on the first day we really werent doing too well and we found out afterward we had a lot of seaweed on the bottom of the boat
3641783 we got our timing together because thats one of the biggest things with double handed sailing youve got to be in sync
3641784 it was kind of tough sailing in the light wind but it came together nicely
3641785 we were leading from day 1 and we knew we just had to be consistent
3641786 everyone has their own opinion of what i should do but i think that its my life
3641787 i know there might be wrong decisions that i make and there might be right decisions that i make but theyre decisions that i make for myself and i think the only decision i can make is to be 100 per cent supportive of myself and not doubt myself at all
3641788 i really dont know why michelle continues to do this
3641789 we have a major this week and if you cant qualify for a major i dont see any reason why you should play with the men we all have different agendas in life
3641790 the ability to acquire this piece of property is really monumental
3641791 delay is the enemy of the everglades you dont come back from being poisoned
3641792 its very exciting knowing that i could be the first true freshman quarterback to play at lsu in a long time
3641793 just being a part of that situation is really important in my life so whenever that opportunity comes im going to work hard and do what i need to do
3641794 its a little different now than it was during recruiting because i wasnt in the top three
3641795 to be honest when i signed i really didnt think id have a chance to play this year
3641796 theyve been telling me to work as if i want to be the starter so ive been doing that
3641797 now if i come here and do my thing ill play early if i dont ill be on the side
3641798 and i can tell you that certainly lee and hatch are guys who have been through it a little longer and understand it a little bit better but i think jordan jefferson also has ability and is one of those guys who will take snaps this fall i think that hes improved hes much more seasoned ready to play in games
3641799 he doesnt quite know where hes throwing it just yet but hes got an aggressive mind he wants to learn he is a good quarterback has a good quarterback demeanor hes not going to judge himself too quickly hes going to allow himself the opportunity to learn it and hes going to pursue excellence it appears to me
3641800 he certainly has some good speed and solid instincts so i think its too early for me to say that i can remove the field or that opportunity from him
3641801 hatch is a pretty good runner a very physical runner but jordans quicker
3641802 hes got quick feet and jordans more fluid he has fluid quickness and i would say hes probably a little faster
3641803 jordan is athletic a great young man does a lot of good things from the position and won a state championship
3641804 hes going to battle were going to give him some opportunities and see how it goes
3641805 hes going to be a little slower because hes got verbiage barriers hes got to overcome understanding what to do
3641806 experience from high school practice is so different from experience at college practice

3641816 if nothing changes youre getting to the point where you wont have any fishermen at all
3641817 if the boats cant make it the docks dont make it and the processors dont make it
3641818 its just that you have fewer boats trying to catch them because they cant make any money
3641819 about two years ago i said this industry might be good for another 10 or 15 years
3641820 i dont think its going to last that long unless something changes quick
3641821 if you go and sell everything to the shop youll never make it
3641822 a lot of these guys they dont know how to do anything else
3641823 they cant make the money they were making shrimping so they just stick it out
3641824 its the second day of school because friday was really a practice run
3641825 but with everything that weve had to change there really havent been any problems
3641826 we start at wednesday evening at 6 oclock we start frying then its frying non stop until sunday
3641827 i have a sister in law who had the recipe for the batter
3641828 my mother used to do a lot of it herself my mother is 101 years old and still cooking
3641829 i would never give it up not unless i was dying of alcohol poisoning or something
3641830 its inelastic demand as far as many of these stocks are concerned
3641831 so far theres signs that they are holding up although theres still concern that these industries will see some impact
3641832 id rather spend 4 or 5 on quality beer than 3 on hopped up water
3641833 its worth the extra buck or two to get quality
3641834 the culture the custom of the cajun people its gone
3641835 another one of the rights that big government has taken away from the people
3641836 overnight were going to go from law abiding citizens business owners taxpayers to being criminals

3641838 spring seemed like it was just a really bad run of events
3641839 me breaking my hand kyle pirtle was out with knee surgery brad bustle ended up going down about halfway through it just seemed like it would never end
3641840 i think in the offseason guys were banged up and they worked hard to get back healthy again
3641841 now we have all of our starters back pretty much and were playing hard just like it was in the spring before everybody got hurt
3641842 we dont have any seniors but we have a bunch of kids that have sacrificed for each other grown up together have been in a fight some
3641843 theyre doing well and theyve bonded together i dont know if ive ever coached a better group
3641844 in the spring we had four starters out and we have no seniors not a single senior offensive lineman on the roster
3641845 but what i said then and i still believe it were a lot better now because of all they had to go through during the spring
3641846 normally your 1s will go then your 2s will go and the 2s will get fewer reps than the 1s
3641847 all of a sudden the 2s had to go in with the 1s not only did they get more reps but their reps were with mike desormeaux and tyrell fenroy so when they screwed up it didnt screw up other freshman or backups it screwed up the 1s
3641848 so theres a ton of pressure on them and they competed and scrapped every play they didnt just get reps they got important reps they felt some pressure and thats a good thing
3641849 we have a system where we want to make you defend the whole field were good at running the ball and if people let us run the ball were going to run it
3641850 at the same time we have a group of young men that you want to put the ball in their hands mike desormeaux jason chery derrick smith tyrell fenroy we have guys that you want to let them make plays we are going to do that were going to call an offense thats going to force people to defend all those players
3641851 i feel like i have 15 brothers the trust is there with everyone we do everything together i think that helps it gets us closer together we like to think it gives us some type of strength
3641852 keep pets out of the lake watch children do not feed alligators
3641853 we are pleased that prices are coming down a little bit but it is a long term problem both in terms of the availability of supply and the impact on our economy shipping billions of dollars outside our country to buy foreign oil
3641854 i dont think united have another level to go to they had a lot of players who have been at the peak of their form for the last two years
3641855 rio ferdinand has been awesome for the last two years and cristiano ronaldo was unbelievable i dont think youll see that again
3641856 wayne rooney carlos tevez ryan giggs they have all been fantastic
3641857 i think we can close the gap because man utd were at the very top of their game last season
3641858 but weve been very close to them and we had injuries and a change of manager
3641859 the new manager has come in and made a few changes hes made some great signings deco looks awesome so im excited to see him play
3641860 we need to start well and get off to a flyer just keep winning
3641861 man utd have a few tough games early on liverpool have made some good signings and will be stronger this year we need to focus
3641862 paesaggi liquidi idee progettuali di paesaggio per il tratto emiliano del fiume po da piacenza a reggio emilia
3641863 i dont think united have another level to go to
3641864 they had a lot of players at the peak of their form for the last two years
3641865 rio ferdinand has been awesome for the last two years and cristiano ronaldo was unbelievable i dont think youll see that again
3641866 wayne rooney carlos tevez ryan giggs they have all been fantastic

3641868 but weve been very close to them and we had injuries and a change of manager
3641869 the new manager has come in and made a few changes hes made some great signings deco looks awesome so im excited to see him play
3641870 we need to start well and get off to a flyer just keep winning
3641871 man united have a few tough games early on liverpool have made some good signings and will be stronger this year we need to focus
3641872 we are going to build a team and its not possible for him to go to another club
3641873 i thought the commonwealth bank result was pretty good especially in the context of a very difficult general operating environment with credit markets essentially malfunctioning for the better part of the reporting period mr wright said
3641874 i dont know of too many banks around the world increasing their dividend at the moment

3641876 thats why were going as if jarod is going to be the quarterback against towson
3641877 if kaipo comes back that will be great but were not going to push that if you start pushing hamstrings a guy can miss the whole season if you come back too quick
3641878 but well just call the game we just call what we call we dont really know whos going to carry the ball anyway
3641879 i tried to get better at slotback during the spring and i definitely think i did they want me to play quarterback now so ill do that
3641880 as far as quarterback im at a point where i feel pretty comfortable i can always get better i dont think any of the time i spent at slotback is going to hurt me
3641881 the couple had not intended to publicise their marriage but decided to confirm the event due to mounting media speculation

3641962 its part of the cost of being able to live here and talk about football and stuff like that all you have to do is watch the olympics to figure out the rest of the world doesnt quite live like we do
3641963 we found out yesterday and to be honest it sucks
3641964 to see this happen to someone who came out here and worked his ass off and wanted it so bad and is a great guy to have this happen to him is unfortunate we loved having him around
3641965 we go out after games together we travel together and have fun together
3641966 whenever you lose somebody like that especially when its out of your control and the person doesnt want to go either it makes it even tougher

3641974 in terms of the number of students who are ready this year compared to last we are talking about genuine progress
3641975 more students are reaching at least a minimum level of readiness for college credit courses were keeping a lot of kids from having to take remedial level courses that translates to millions of dollars that are being saved at the state level
3641976 we have a more heterogeneous population of test takers so were including those kids who werent considering college or arent considering college

3641981 with hunger on the rise we are doing our best to stream incoming contributions to the people most in need in africa asia and the caribbean

3641985 the governor absolutely must deliver the resources needed to make this mandate succeed
3641986 gateway to critical thinking pivotal for success in science engineering and technology
3641987 i am certain that some will oppose this goal as unattainable and overly aggressive
3641988 its too early to put a price tag on these efforts and more critical to identify the elements of the plan i do think that we have had better conversations about algebra and math readiness in the last 20 days than weve had in the last 20 years
3641989 we really need the money now we need this plan now
3641990 im glad to see the state superintendent is embracing the goal of teaching algebra to all california eighth graders and moving forward to improve educational achievement in california
3641991 i look forward to working with the education community to determine the best way to implement and support californias nation leading algebra i test standard
3641992 the best way we know of to get kids ready for algebra in the eighth grade is to get them to grade level in mathematics and arithmetic in seventh grade
3641993 they shouldnt need more money to get the kids to where theyre supposed to be
3641994 were pleased to see things out on the table so that we can sit down and discuss this for the betterment of the students
3641995 its always a problem when the state shoots first and asks questions later
3641996 given that students have a constitutional right to education its always problematic when the state sets a standard but doesnt provide the resources to achieve it
3641997 a lot of the kids were capable but they werent disciplined enough to sit down and do their homework every night
3641998 at redwood we saw a lot of kids that came in and then had to repeat algebra i again in the ninth grade
3641999 we have many fine programs out there in excellent districts that are and have been doing this for years

3642004 i am very disappointed in the parti quebecois which instead of encouraging quebec athletes wants to politicize the games and provoke a battle of the rags a battle of the flags
3642005 overt discouragement of attendance of a witness whos been summoned would constitute basis for contempt

3642011 we do not believe that an internal provincial police investigation would be seen as fair transparent objective or credible enough to bring all the answers that people are looking for
3642012 we want to take advantage of those credentials of their demonstrated ability to integrate into the canadian society by giving them the opportunity to stay here on a permanent basis without having to leave
3642013 if they go back to their home country quite often they can choose never to come back because it can take up to six years to get their application processed

3642017 i dont believe harper ever really wanted an inquiry at all but certainly not before an election

3642025 you have to wonder when they look at what they consider a loophole with such excitement
3642026 that would suggest manipulating the process and i think opens the door to suspicion
3642027 the prospect of someone coming in with no id and registering and voting is contrary to every sort of protection that legislators and lawmakers have built into this system for decades
3642028 the processes and the law and the systems in our 88 counties are not equipped to handle same day registration
3642029 this is one of many ways well be encouraging our supporters to skip the lines on election day and make sure their vote is cast early
3642030 instructions are being developed and being sent to boards of election across the state to make sure voting is consistent
3642031 there is no question that the huge effort to register and turn out voters at ohio state university is going to have a positive impact on our race
3642032 the georgia crisis serves as a warning to countries such as ukraine and moldova that they should desist from petitioning for nato entry
3642033 otherwise moscow may intervene to protect the allegedly threatened interests of the russian population
3642034 russia now flush with cash wants to rebuild its 19th century imperial sphere of influence in the former soviet union
3642035 it also wants to make an example out of georgia to other nato aspirants what the chinese call kill the chicken to take care of the monkey so the ukrainians will think russia would use force to prevent them from joining nato

3642239 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3642240 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3642253 i think the afl are probably on the right path there it is dangerous how to just let people come on the ground so i think theyll just look after the players welfare

3642394 we have the best health care in the world we have the best education system
3642395 there is a big difference between being anti american and being critical of the united states
3642396 the fundamental role of anti americanism in europe in general and particularly among those on the left is to absolve themselves of their own moral failings and intellectual errors by heaping them onto the monster scapegoat the united states of america the u s is charged with all the evils real or imagined that afflict humanity from the falling price of beef in france to aids in africa and global warming everywhere the result is a widespread refusal to accept responsibility for ones own actions
3642397 anti americanism is hypocrisy at its finest you can spend your evening catching the latest episode of
3642398 it all boils down to the fact that knowledge and intelligence are two different issues rote memorization of world capitals does not equate intelligence
3642399 as an american please allow me to begin by asserting that our nation has had its strengths and its weaknesses its successes and its failures and its justices and injustices throughout history and continuing into the present although i sense much patriotism for my homeland i recognize our need for humility to understand that our country is not above questioning or reproach but is rather under the same standards as all other nations of the world i would simply like to ask those who view our country from afar to maintain a balanced perspective and realize too that there exists good and bad in america both in terms of its domestic society and politics as well as in its relations with other nations whilst there may be growing anti americanism in the united kingdom i do not believe such sentiment to be reciprocated on our side of the atlantic i viewed a recent survey that indicated most americans view england positively and never have i seen the flag of your country or any other foreign land for that matter burned in the streets of our cities clearly we as american citizens have not meant to be your enemies
3642400 as someone who takes human rights seriously im appalled by the lack of sympathy the left feels toward the victims of any regime other than the bush administration lets shout it to prisoners everywhere if youre not harmed by an american your suffering doesnt count
3642401 ambivalence antipathy and resentment toward and about the united states have comprised an important component of european culture since the american revolution at the latest thus way before america became the worlds mr big the proverbial eight hundred pound gorilla and a credible rival to europes main powers particularly britain and france while the politics style and discourse of the bush administration and of george w bush as a person have undoubtedly exacerbated anti american sentiment among europeans and fostered a heretofore unmatched degree of unity between elite and mass opinion in europe they are not cause indeed a change to a center left administration in washington led by a democratic president would not bring about its abatement let alone disappearance
3642402 is euro disney land a threat to the french culture if french culture can be squashed by mickey mouse or more exactly by simply moving mickey geographically it would have to be disturbingly fragile
3642403 anti americanism is the only face of xenophobia still broadly accepted in europe
3642404 americans find themselves damned either way if they remain within their own borders they are isolationist hicks who are shirking their responsibilities if they intervene they are rapacious imperialists
3642405 the british find it very difficult to come to terms with the loss of their global dominance we felt a deep sense of hurt and loss we used to run the world and we dont anymore so in order to palliate that insecurity we tend to run ourselves down too much and were also snooty about the people who do run the world
3642406 it is tragic that anti american ideas are so easily passed through rumour while reconciliatory ideas and notions must be backed up with catalogues of evidence before they are even considered purely because of the fact that it is so much easier to hate than to keep an objective open mind
3642407 other common anti american objections are ignorance and stupidity in dealing with these two i have no reason to suspect that the average american is any less intelligent than the average person from anywhere else one trait i have noticed is that other cultures are generally much more ashamed of any deficit in the intellect of the individual especially ours the british and as such will make a much greater attempt to hide it if all cultures bar one are scared of looking stupid and take action to prevent that happening then that one remaining culture is inevitably going to be lumbered with that image
3642408 we became not a melting pot but a beautiful mosaic different people different beliefs different yearnings different hopes different dreams
3642409 most of the anti americanism these days stems from plain old nationalistic jealousy by a lot of countries that are born of insecurity about their own place in the world and their painful self awareness of their own failings and shortcomings like the kids in the next block who are jealous of the boy who has a better bicycle or a newer fancier skateboard phuque em all
3642410 europeans like the rest of the world hate america and americans but love our aid when in distress and our soldiers to die for their countries you need to work live and pay taxes from this side of the atlantic to understand our vision of europe and the rest of the world
3642411 unjustified hatred of americans there is much unjustified hatred in the world there is unjustified hatred of the usa much of this arises from the victimisation complex that sweeps much of mankind whoever is in charge whoever is powerful or successful will also be hated this immature hatred often evaporates quickly with a little reason or thought there are some some invalid unjustified criticisms the most widespread hate is the hate by people the world over who fall victim to their own shortcomings and want a scapegoat
3642412 usa citizens are not given world news in the same way as most the other developed nations
3642413 despite the usas dominance of mass media it is frequently only the pro usa self congratulatory messages that seem to arrive in europe the usa citizens criticism and disbelief of their own government is not apparent which gives the overall impression that americans are either gullible ignorant or honestly uncaring
3642414 if a person outside of american culture is a hateful person they may actively hate and verbally attack america
3642415 i think it is best when faced with people from other nations to treat them as individuals
3642416 sometimes the caliber of a nation is found not in why it is liked but rather in why it is not
3642417 everyone is in favor of free speech hardly a day passes without its being extolled but some peoples idea of it is that they are free to say what they like but if anyone says anything back that is an outrage
3642418 with a military that has become a laughing stock and her increasing irrelevance in the world around her i believe that the canada i know and loved is gone
3642419 a film is a very specific and personal account of bill carters experience in sarajevo during the war and we would very much like to make the film here
3642420 can you tell me how many chicken complaints youve gotten
3642421 uh huh so you are passing an ordinance to move all the chickens down to the ag zoned area right
3642422 so its not like you are dealing with wild chickens running all over the town then
3642423 if their parents would buy food for them instead of beer and cigarettes the rest of the community wouldnt have to feed these kids dont ya think
3642424 back in the day all the italian woman owned boarding houses
3642425 my grandmother owned one and my father stayed there thats when he saw my mother she was 12
3642426 he told my grandmother that he wanted to marry her daughter
3642427 do any of you hold positions in your class like secretary or president

3642512 by the time of the civil war poor whites were indeed white supremacists who extolled their own merit in racial rather than class terms the common man also wrapped himself in class illusions that separated him from the actual experiences of his life he actively embraced the idea that he was an aristocrat identifying whit the planter class through a glowing sense of participation in the common brotherhood of white men the ego warming and ego expanding distinction between the white man and the black elevated this common white man

3642620 ia mengambil kekayaannya dari tempatnya dan mengeluarkannya juga dari tempatnya
3642621 ia tidak pernah menurutiku di masa jahiliyah apalagi dalam islam
3642622 aku berharap darinya agar kepalaku selamat dan berharap ia melepaskanku dan aku melepaskannya tetapi ia tak akan mau melakukan itu
3642623 apa yang kau rasakan jika melihat seseorang dari umatku yang hendak shalat
3642624 sebab setiap seorang hamba bersujud 1x kepada allah allah mengangkatnya 1 derajat
3642625 sebab dalam sedekah ada 4 keuntungan baginya yaitu keberkahan dalam hartanya hidupnya disukai sedekah itu kelak akan menjadi hijab antara dirinya dengan api neraka dan segala macam musibah akan terhalau dari dirinya
3642626 tidakkah kau tahu wahai muhammad bahwa barang siapa yang menyukai emas dan perak ia bukan orang yang ikhlas jika kau lihat seseorang yang tidak menyukai dinar dan dirham tidak suka pujian dan sanjunang aku bisa pastikan bahwa ia orang yang ikhlas maka aku meninggalkannya selama seorang hamba masih menyukai harta dan sanjungan dan hatinya selalu terikat dengan kesenangan dunia ia sangat patuh padaku
3642627 aku minta agar allah membiarkanku berbagi dalam harta dan anak
3642628 berbagilah dengan manusia dalam harta dan anak dan janjikanlah mereka tidaklah janji setan kecuali tipuan
3642629 wahai muhammad aku tak bisa menyesatkan orang sedikitpun aku hanya bisa membisikan dan menggoda
3642630 wahai rasul allah takdir telah ditentukan dan pena takdir telah kering maha suci allah yang menjadikanmu pemimpin para nabi dan rasul pemimpin pendudk surga dan yang telah menjadikan aku pemimpin mahluk mahluk celaka dan pemimpin penduduk neraka aku si celaka yang terusir ini akhir yang ingin aku sampaikan kepadamu dan aku tak berbohong

3642643 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3642644 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3642645 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3642646 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3642647 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3642648 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3642649 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3642650 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3642651 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3642652 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3642653 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3642654 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3642655 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3642656 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3642661 the first half of 2008 was very exciting and the strongest first half in our companys history we harvested the fruits of our investment during 2007 in building a strong infrastructure our operations in europe and the americas are performing very well and the transition from a sales mix favoring hardware and third party components to software and service in apac is progressing according to our plans tis has established itself as the clear global technological leader in document capture solutions which has given us significant traction in all our markets
3642662 our progress in the first half of the year reflects our synergistic m amp a activities last year and the restructuring completed at the end of the year in addition the company saw some additional positive trends our sales team is executing at high levels sales cycles are shrinking the sales mix is improving and our pipeline is growing we are proud that the investments we have made both in infrastructure and on acquisitions are meaningfully contributing to the companys positive momentum as we enter the second half of 2008

3642755 theres a lot of different stuff in here and most of it is an afterthought
3642756 ive done a lot in baseball and this is kind of a crowning moment
3642757 its very similar to being an olympic athlete you realize that youre representing the united states on a great stage
3642758 they expect us to be umpiring at a high level and the last several weeks ive been getting ready and preparing the best that i can said costello who left for beijing on saturday
3642759 theres a lot i want to see and do but really my priority is the job being ready to umpire at a high level every game then ill take in the other things
3642760 weve had similar career paths weve in the minors colleges each worked a few college world series
3642761 hes a funny man a good umpire and a great guy
3642762 since this tournament will be played by eight very qualified countries and many of them are bringing professional players i was looking for the best amateur umpires in the world runchey said
3642763 perry and joe have solid credentials theyve both been triple a umpires and very well respected in the ncaa
3642764 i know theyll represent their country and other umpires from the united states with professionalism and class
3642765 what keeps me going every year is the challenge of doing a game that really has to be arbitrated and when you do a good job and finish knowing it was handled well and the right calls were made you get a great feeling of accomplishment he said
3642766 i dont care if its in the minors in college or doing a city league game you want to get it right if you work two three or even more tough games in a week and know you did a good job thats a pretty good rush
3642767 we will obviously talk to the family get their input and make a decision

3642770 if you are exciting your early users like this you will get found
3642771 are journalists discovering that pr people are expendable will the crowd ultimately displace the pr pro as the trusted primary or even secondary source for story ideas what if any industries will be immune from this trend
3642772 so what then for pr if this is a universal truth and i am not sure that it is does it make us obsolete if we dont adapt yessir new media summit in chicago she said and i agree that pitching is broken we have to stop spamming people and make sure that companies and products are easy and a joy to discover thats no easy feat further it means giving up control however in a google age where self discovery rules its becoming a must
3642773 one of the little secrets ive learned is that pr people play a much bigger role in life than geeks often give them credit for they are major influencers who help shape what story gets written about you if you write them off or treat them badly theyll get negative stories written about you

3642776 the problem with taking it down is that it is a worthless fight i can spend hours everyday deleting stuff just for it to be posted again 30 minutes laters that endless fighting leads to everyone saying that microsoft is taking away their free speech censoring the forum etc that leads to even more problems that i dont want to deal with

3642779 the tv pack release has gone through several evolutions over time and in the end we could not deliver everything our enthusiast community was expecting we could however deliver a really great oem experience and do it in parallel with our efforts for the next major windows release which like it or not is our primary release vehicle at the moment
3642780 i was walking down the street wearing glasses when the prescription ran out
3642781 the site were proposing to build on is the site they dump the snow on and drainage culverts have been crushed there because of road construction
3642782 we want to improve all the culverts so you can get an improved environment
3642783 all we are is the owners of the land bc transit would lease the land and would be responsible for addressing environmental concerns while the land is used by them
3642784 that site doesnt look like your typical gorgeous wetland but i find it disgusting that they are planning this
3642785 it doesnt matter what they are putting on there whether it is environmentally friendly or not
3642786 we will make sure there is a free flow of goods people and expression during the 2010 olympic games
3642787 i think we are already seeing some improvements i think we will see more
3642788 i think people who come from outside vancouver will see communities striving to be even better there will be significant improvements
3642789 i believe we are making some significant steps to improve the lives of those in the downtown eastside
3642790 i dont see this as an area of problems i see this as an area of possibilities
3642791 ive got three domestic reporters who are asking all the questions
3642792 were dealing with it because we think its important to make it a healthier community to live in were dealing with literally thousands of citizens who have significant challenges in their lives
3642793 its not something that can be done quickly if it was it would have been solved across the country and around the world
3642794 just as beijing has rolled out the red carpet so will vancouver in 2010 welcome the world
3642795 to take whatever position they think they wish to take
3642796 the commission is the best chance for people to come and explain what happened and have a totally independent organization assess what happened and make findings
3642797 we havent reached that decision yet but we may be testing that in court
3642798 what happens on private lands when they are not forestry lands any more
3642799 they would have to enter into an agreement with the ministry of tourism culture and the arts to amend the current operating agreement for the controlled recreation area in which they operate the ski hill to include operation of the golf course this would allow them to use crown land on which most of the golf course would be situated they would also have to acquire a piece of land which belongs to beaumont timber on which they propose to build four or five holes of their golf course
3642800 anybody who knows anything about golf courses look i will tell you right now it is not cost practical
3642801 im out here yesterday and today trying to find solutions
3642802 but i had to be here to get some resolutions
3642803 as simple as one nine on one side of the highway and the other nine on the other side
3642804 the only statement the city of rossland has in writing from red mountain ventures from don thompson vp is that they wish the city to put their applications for zoning bylaw and official community plan amendments on hold pending further notice
3642805 truly id like to thank you who saved my life the gentleman who drove a silver coloured 4x4 i dont know his name but i remember he hit the bear
3642806 without him i wouldnt be here i know i only had a minute left probably less
3642807 hes going to eat me hes not going to go away
3642808 i could not sleep i have very bad dreams i still can see the bear that tried to eat me its fresh i cannot get over it right now
3642809 risk assessments would be more focused on the likelihood of harming others and definitely if somebody is suicidal depressed has a history of breaching court orders has a history of violence such a risk assessment would come back that he would be at high risk to offend then the court would be entitled to detain him
3642810 if we have a concern about a person being suicidal within the custody centre if they were being released we would notify police basically because there is authority under the mental health act to apprehend somebody transport them to hospital and then theyre assessed medically
3642811 it wouldnt be common that somebody would be in that state on release
3642812 oh no i dont use product i just wake up looking like a million dollars
3642813 dies ist eine katastrophe die von menschen herbeigef hrt wurde

3642822 the injured man and woman had been fighting with each other following a fight between their teenaged daughters
3642823 during the altercation the man was jumped by the woman and her son and struck in the head by a four by four fence post before a sword and knife were brought into the mix
3642824 there has been a high level of mistrust and heavy handedness on the part of the city
3642825 harrys injury healed a lot more quickly than the hurt caused by the words
3642826 i put my hand down the front of his leg
3642827 i could slip my fingers into a hole where his muscle had been ive never ever felt anything like that
3642828 yet the canadian papers were filled with jerome quit again
3642829 some people run with enormous power and musculature and churning harry just flew he was so smooth
3642830 people are most upset and very disappointed by the results
3642831 it was not just the residents it was also people like a cab driver who talked about the pleasure he gets in bringing people from out of town through shaughnessy heights because of the estate like quality of the neighbourhood

3642836 sentiment in the aussie of course has been very weak for the last two weeks since the rba reserve bank of australia suggested they are likely to shift to cutting interest rates
3642837 im actually still very nervous because of the fact that at the end of the day the market is still quite long aussie and the question is are there a lot more accounts that need to offload it
3642838 there were a lot of speculative positions being taken off the table because a lot of japanese traders had been heavily long aussie yen and also kiwi yen
3642839 those are starting to hurt and we are seeing quite a rapid unwinding of that leading to aussie dollar coming under some pretty decent pressure
3642840 al usar internet la gente cree que todo vale y ocurre lo contrario se persigue cualquier delito
3642841 en las webs hay cosas que han pasado toda la vida como los cr os que se pegan en el colegio la diferencia es que ahora eso se difunde por puro exhibicionismo
3642842 una paliza puede ser un delito de lesiones pero si esa paliza se publica en internet se convierte en un delito de incitaci n a la discriminaci n
3642843 lo primero es proteger su intimidad despu s ya se ver si hay o no delito
3642844 esto es inacabable aunque fu semos mil no llegar amos a todo los delincuentes van a m s por eso es importante que el ciudadano colabore y si ve una agresi n lo denuncie
3642845 esto va por modas la gente ve una conducta en la tele y la imita a ra z de un ataque a una tienda de chinos empezamos a observar agresiones similares en otros locales lo mismo pas con las peleas entre ni os en clase las palizas a mendigos o las carreras de coches

3642868 i thought the commonwealth bank result was pretty good especially in the context of a very difficult general operating environment with credit markets essentially malfunctioning for the better part of the reporting period
3642869 i dont know of too many banks around the world increasing their dividend at the moment
3642870 the overall sentiment is that the market believes the next move is going to be an easing and people are happy to come in and buy
3642871 all its probably done is probably pushed out the chance of september move but it definitely doesnt take it off the table at all
3642872 as credit markets started to look a little bit better it was brought back down to earth pretty quick with the announcements of more writedowns in the mortgage sector
3642873 until you see a stabilisation there i think its going to be consistent uncertainty

3642876 it can typically take months to introduce new mobile content and services across all the carriers this clearly needs to change as content and services lose relevancy with each passing month and some content is never considered because of the production time mobile service and content providers need to be able to react to the market quickly and provision new mobile content and services in a more dynamic fashion

3642879 come the beginning of 2009 it is our hope and the current faa schedule that we will be able to be launching heavier payloads
3642880 in terms of the number of students who are ready this year compared to last we are talking about genuine progress
3642881 more students are reaching at least a minimum level of readiness for college credit courses were keeping a lot of kids from having to take remedial level courses that translates to millions of dollars that are being saved at the state level
3642882 we have a more heterogeneous population of test takers so were including those kids who werent considering college or arent considering college
3642883 mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
3642884 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when the convention program will focus on renewing americas economy
3642885 im convinced that the national interest demands a new approach to our interaction with the world
3642886 part of it is political parties are a distant analog to families and you really hate to step outside a family environment
3642887 a single endorsement does not hide the fact that sen obama has no record of achievement beyond the confines of his party
3642888 while john mccain has spent his career putting the country first ahead of personal and party interests sen obamas record is a lesson in partisanship
3642889 his anti war posture might be attractive to obama but hes anathema to much of the progressive base of the democratic party
3642890 i think though it is impossible to predict with absolute confidence that the delegates would not deliver their votes unless at a minimum he switched political parties
3642891 mark warner is the future of the democratic party and putting him on tuesday night with hillary clinton is exactly right move for obama
3642892 are a number of reasons to be skeptical of the report
3642893 initial tests conducted by internet evolution of deep packet inspection equipment indicated that the devices that were put forward for testing had difficulty identifying the protocol being used if simple encryption techniques were used
3642894 thats a far cry from being able to identify the contents with sufficient resolution to pick out the artist and label the system would also have to avoid red carding legitimate song purchases and noninfringing snippets of copyrighted works
3642895 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3642896 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3642897 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3642898 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3642899 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3642900 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3642901 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3642902 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3642903 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3642904 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3642905 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3642906 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3642907 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3642908 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3642909 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3642910 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3642911 who are open to doing something on the production side
3642912 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3642913 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3642914 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3642915 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3642916 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3642917 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3642918 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3642919 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3642920 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3642921 saying which she placed this dish in front of me
3642922 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3642923 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3642924 neither a state nor the federal government can constitutionally force a person to profess a belief or disbelief in any religion
3642925 a very outgoing person she was the type of person who would do anything for anyone
3642926 she was a great listener she was extremely honest just an extremely kind hearted person
3642927 it was all he talked about it was all he wanted to do just work himself up
3642928 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3642929 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3642930 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3642931 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3642932 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3642933 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3642934 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3642935 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3642936 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3642937 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3642938 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3642939 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3642940 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3642941 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3642942 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3642943 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3642944 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3642945 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3642946 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3642947 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3642948 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3642949 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3642950 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3642951 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3642952 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3642953 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3642954 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3642955 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3642956 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3642957 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3642958 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3642959 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3642960 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3642961 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3642962 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3642963 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3642964 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3642965 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3642966 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3642967 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3642968 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3642969 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3642970 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3642971 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3642972 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3642973 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3642974 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3642975 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3642976 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3642977 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3642978 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3642979 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3642980 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

3643110 it is now a time in my career where i should not see myself or allow other people to see me as a young player any more
3643111 a lot of the players when i first walked into the dressing room are no longer around and i have 43 test caps so it is time to step up and deliver
3643112 it looks like i might get an opportunity now at number three and it is up to me to take that opportunity
3643113 certainly i have been up and down the order throughout my test match career but more recently i have settled at five
3643114 that is where i have put in my best performances but as a player you always want to test yourself and be as good as you possibly can be
3643115 you look at the best players in the world and a lot of them bat at number three or number four
3643116 people might say that batting at number five is easier than three but you want to test yourself as much as you can and batting at number three you do that
3643117 you could be in after the first ball or three hours later
3643118 that challenges your skills as a batsman and that is what i want to face up to
3643119 i know i can do it i have done it a little bit in the ashes but i have to start converting those 50s into hundreds like i did at lords against south africa
3643120 if i can do it more consistently i will know i am going in the right direction and hopefully the best years of my batting are still ahead of me
3643121 being 26 now i have got experience behind me and i know a bit more about test cricket
3643122 anyone that looks into the dressing room and sees the talent inside it would believe it is possible we can win the ashes there is a lot of ability
3643123 like kp said if we play like we did at the oval and at times this summer we can do it
3643124 the important thing in the lead up to 2005 was that we were winning test matches regularly it became a habit and we played consistent cricket
3643125 as we showed against south africa we scored 600 in the first test and then 200 in the next
3643126 when you play the best team in the world you cannot afford that kind of inconsistency in your game
3643127 it will not be until the winter when see him develop a bit more but i guess the thing i saw from kev this week i know he is a big admirer of michael vaughan and the way he captained the side was that his captaincy style is going to be very similar to the way he plays cricket
3643128 like his batting he will trust himself to make the right call at the right time

3643135 neither of them dived their best but nobody made mistakes it sounds like sour grapes to me
3643136 this was blakes only competition and the games are finished for him i just hope he doesnt upset tom because he has another to deal with in 11 days his individual competition if he does he will have me to deal with

3643199 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3643200 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3643201 ik heb nooit beweerd dat acteurs en vee hetzelfde zijn ik heb alleen maar gezegd dat je acteurs als vee moet behandelen
3643202 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3643203 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3643204 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3643205 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3643206 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3643207 if you want to understand what the liberal democrats are up to look outside london over the past fortnight several local papers have published almost identical stories in which the lib dems say that they are shifting resources to target labour seats in their area nick clegg is quoted as saying that if only x voters shift from labour to the lib dems usually less than 10 per cent they will win swansea west derby north hull north norwich south liverpool wavertree warrington south city of durham blaydon newcastle north etc
3643208 a tory push to win back seats in the north of england suffers a blow today with the partys favourite thinktank declaring that key cities such as liverpool and sunderland have
3643209 this independent report does not reflect conservative party policy and we do not agree with its conclusions we wholeheartedly support the regeneration of northern cities
3643210 the call from policy exchange will be a huge embarrassment to the tory leader as he heads to north west england today to campaign in marginal seats policy exchange was founded by michael gove the tory education spokesman its policy director is anthony browne who is about to begin working for boris johnson and is tipped for a role at no 10 if the tories win the next election
3643211 the report said we cannot with the best will in the world move deutsche bank to sunderland we may wish it otherwise but we know that it will not happen

3643215 all the essential ingredients to make fine wine to rival the best of bordeaux
3643216 while most chinese wines seem alien to western palates a new breed of chinese winemaker backed by foreign investment and technical advice is already trying to change that reputation
3643217 you see wine being associated with new apartment complexes financial services and luxury products
3643218 true there is a gap between association and appreciation but wine is becoming better known
3643219 consistent quality across a winerys full range is a rarity
3643220 i do a lot of work with oenological professors and professionals here on the ground in china and nothing that i have seen leads me to believe that china will either rival the best of bordeaux or produce fine wine in appreciable quantities
3643221 in 1958 few people would have predicted the usa argentina or chile would be capable of producing good wine
3643222 now nearly every other bottle of wine is made outside of europes big five wine producing regions and these countries lead the new world wine rankings
3643223 well we havent actually had a quarter of negative growth we are not in a recession that is two quarters of negative economic growth
3643224 i would be surprised if the economy was not reacting poorly
3643225 it not just do nothing they have damaged the economy
3643226 how do you win an election on that if you say but i had a better position two years ago then he obama says i had a better position five years ago you are not going to win by being smarter two or five years ago
3643227 obama has twenty five positions every one of them will make your 401k smaller he does not have an economic position to increase growth
3643228 mccain has twenty five ideas twenty four of which will make your 401k bigger
3643229 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3643230 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3643231 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3643232 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3643233 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3643234 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3643235 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3643236 circumvent or otherwise attack the security of the fare media system
3643237 concerned with the core issue of immediate concern in this case the security and integrity of its fare media system
3643238 the tro as initially granted restricted the students from providing true publicly known legally acquired information about the mbtas charliecards and charlietickets in violation of the first amendment
3643239 the current tro as the mbta suggests that it be modified still restricts the students from providing true legally acquired information about these cards this restriction also violates the first amendment
3643240 we decline to discuss our ongoing communications with counsel for the mbta our priority at this point is to ensure that the temporary restraining order is lifted
3643241 continues to hang over our clients heads making them uncertain what if anything they can say about their research and this case

3643247 the most obvious question is why doesnt google maps show any cities or roads for georgia or its neighbors sic armenia and azerbaijan
3643248 the answer is we never launched coverage in those countries because we simply werent satisfied with the map data we had available were constantly searching for the best map data we can find and sometimes will delay launching coverage in a country if we think we can get more comprehensive data
3643249 some of our customers have asked if we removed map data from any of these countries in response to the recent hostilities in that region and i can assure you that is not the case data for these countries were never on google maps in the first place
3643250 due to a safety issue and high defect rate we are issuing a product recall we have been getting reports that some of these units have been running extremely hot and have emitted a burning smell

3643256 thank you for your passion and your intellect on this question
3643257 it is so necessary to have the voices of girls and women in the formation of our public policy
3643258 nancy pelosi has voted for bushs programs every step of the way
3643259 she talks about how once we get in power well be able to make changes but she hasnt changed a thing
3643260 i dont agree that its a good idea to impeach the president unless we have a real case against him
3643261 you cant impeach a president because you disagree with his policies you have to have some high crimes and misdemeanors
3643262 if you are in an impure state then purify yourself well
3643263 the pressure of competition it got the better of me today
3643264 i feel very excited now because we sacrificed a lot to win this gold medal
3643265 and this is a direct competition between the chinese team and the usa team and we are very proud we won
3643266 if we can do our stuff on three up three count it will be a different day
3643267 we will have a very good fight with the chinese
3643268 i just wanted to get the show on the road
3643269 but i let the nerves get the best of me i guess
3643270 i thought my feet were under me and the next thing i knew i was on my back
3643271 the pullback in the japanese economy was quite broad perhaps more broad based than expected but the global component is with the trade figures since exports were down quite a bit
3643272 japan compared with five years ago has a much more diversified set of export destinations but if all of them are slowing down there is no real shelter
3643273 even though the economy contracted in april june it would be more accurate to think that it wont last long
3643274 the potential for chinas domestic consumption is huge but it will be a long term process for china to wean its economy off exports and investment
3643275 the data shows just how sensitive consumers are to petrol prices with the recent drop instantly making consumers feel less pessimistic

3643278 nobody seems to want to remember the fact that we had so many successes and come from behind victories in this campaign and they are due in large part to senator clintons leadership
3643279 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared towards showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3643280 the right knows obama is unelectable except perhaps against attila the hun and a third party would come in then anyway
3643281 this has been a very instructive call talking to myself

3643297 he encourages older people to think i can do this because that old man can do this
3643298 to be honest i dont understand why people are buying these videos
3643299 i think our older customers must feel a sense of security by watching videos with an actor who is in the same generation
3643300 seniors get depressed because they dont have anything to do they go crazy
3643301 gambling is an addictive behavior make no mistake about it gambling has all the properties of a psychoactive substance and again the reason is that it changes the neurochemistry of the brain
3643302 theres no such thing as clean coal we dont need e on to keep the lights on by burning the planet we need an investment in renewables to meet our energy needs and keep the planet habitable
3643303 the climate camp was just the beginning if kingsnorth gets the go ahead people across the uk are committed to stopping it from being built
3643304 its been a great result today but a real victory for us will be when we have conclusively scuppered e ons coal fuelled mania
3643305 if the government give the green light to this power plant e on can expect to be seeing a lot more of us in the future
3643306 the bowsprit of the marjorie was heading for the middle of the repertor at one stage
3643307 people could have been hurt or even killed we are just thankful no one was
3643308 our crews responded quickly after the alert from thames coastguard and were able to reach the vessels in time to pump out the marjorie
3643309 the collision took place in bad conditions in a narrow channel but we are not sure of the exact cause yet
3643310 all i can say is that it will be an expensive operation to fix the marjorie
3643311 organizing is what you do before you do something so that when you do it it is not all mixed up

3643322 were back on terms with all the rest of the teams and we know we can finish first from here

3643369 the bbc is not impartial or neutral its a publicly funded urban organisation with an abnormally large number of young people ethnic minorities and gay people it has a liberal bias not so much a party political bias it is better expressed as a cultural liberal bias

3643406 the credit for this increase really spreads across the whole campus from our investigators who do excellent research to our business and finance people who did an outstanding job of presenting our case for this rate increase

3643580 focus remained very much on the demand side of the equation yesterday with the release of eia numbers revealing that us oil consumption fell by 800 000bpd for the first half of 2008 the sharpest fall since the early 1980s this compounded news that the chinese imports for last month posted a sharp 7 drop early trading today sees brent stable around the 111 50 level after a volatile session yesterday which saw prices boosted initially on the georgian conflict followed by a steep decline as news of the dwindling demand emerged technically we are in sight of the 200 day moving average level 109 110 region which may be tested with the release of weekly stock data this afternoon in the us the numbers promise to be a mixed bag with a consensus view that gasoline stocks will drop by 2 1mio bbls distillates will build around 2mio bbls and crude stocks are forecast to have declined by 250 000bbls of course the previous weeks have illustrated that these numbers are at the least erratic and the only certainty is that volatile trading conditions will follow the release the significance of a dip through the 110 area is that currently although precipitous the fall from the peak in july has been within the range of previous dips following fresh highs since 2002 thus at the moment the uptrend is still technically intact the coming weeks will be instructive with regard to the future direction of oil into the fourth quarter given that numerous weather systems are forming in the atlantic and the iranian situation has i feel further to develop in the near future todays range for brent will embrace 110 114 50 with an outside chance of a test of 109 if the numbers reveal an unabated bearish tone

3643647 en principio no tenemos la certeza absoluta porque el co gulo es grande y hay ciertos l mites en los cuales podemos actuar y hay otros en los que tenemos que desistir de recanalizar la arteria para pasar a un segundo procedimiento que es la neuroprotecci n la cual consiste en tratar de bajar el metabolismo del cerebro para que no requiera muchos nutrientes

3643749 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3643750 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3643751 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3643752 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3643753 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3643754 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3643755 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3643756 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3643757 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3643758 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3643759 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3643760 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3643761 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3643762 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3643767 the son of a regular soldier in the eighth route army liu was born in 1952 joined the peoples liberation army pla at age fifteen rose through the ranks accruing extensive command experience and became deputy political commissar of the pla air force in 2003 also an accomplished and prolific writer of report literature and novels since the 1980s liu has increasingly turned his pen to strategic thinking and military matters and is now one of chinas most influential strategic thinkers
3643768 in those years post wwii the united states adopted a defensive stance in the face of the menacing concentrations of soviet tank formations but now the soviet union has collapsed and the united states has gone on the offensive however one should not infer from this change in its offense defense posture that the united states has shifted its strategic focus away from europe in fact so long as the u s objective is to dominate the whole world europe reamins its center of gravity its basic bearing point it plants one foot on its own land the united states and the other foot on europe doing so enables it to stretch out both its arms to cover the whole world asia does not furnish the conditions for shoring up the u s ambitions when the iraq war broke out europe saw through the united states intention of controlling the center of the world as a prelude to taking control of the european continental plate and they opposed that war with exceptional vigor in fact more vigorously than some of the arab countries but the united states fought the war anyway and europe was forced to swallow the bitter pills
3643769 those of us who have a world perspective can sense the heavy pressures to which others are being subjected but those of us who merely have a chinese perspective only sense that the united states is using the taiwan issue to cause trouble actually the pressures to which china are subjected are relatively minor compared to those offered by other countries and especially russia at first sight it would seem that the exacerbation of the taiwan issue places china in a dilemma if china engages in an all out arms race with the united states or in other words engages in an all out arms race with taiwan it will ultimately be worn down by the united states just like the soviet union yet if china maintains a policy of low military spending and devotes its financial resources to economic construction the disparity will further increase and china will be helpless before the u s military blackmail
3643770 amb property corporation a world leading developer and owner of industrial real estate announced yesterday that it had acquired approximately 133 100 square meters of land in the xiuzhou logistics park in jiaxing of zhejiang province the company said it planned to build a 74 612 square meter distribution center on the site its latest effort to expand its distribution network throughout the country amb announced earlier it planned to operate us 1 billion to us 1 5 billion worth of assets in china by 2010 it currently runs a portfolio of approximately 185 882 square meters of distribution spaces in shanghai kunshan and ningbo prologis a united states developer owner and manager of distribution facilities has also recently expanded its footprint in the city through land acquisition in the same logistics park

3643772 i have always believed that the primary adversary of the united states in asia is not china but japan
3643773 that is why the united states has kept japan so rigidly under its thumb
3643774 the united states has cut away japans testicles and japan can only serve the united states as a court eunuch
3643775 the united states feels that having japan as its only military dog is not enough so it has bred the taiwan independence military dog these two dogs are keeping watch for it over china the current focus of the asian strategy of the united states is on firmly controlling japan and at the same time guarding against china hold on to one and keep an eye on the other and if possible possible swallow yet another which one north korea
3643776 however that is not the end of it the asian strategy of the united states has still another and deeper level a core level preventing china and japan from joining hands everyone thinks that is impossible but americans believe it is possible americans are always able to look ten or more steps ahead when they formulate strategy we are doing quite well if we manage to look one day ahead they are able to look two days ahead three days ahead and even farther the biggest difference between china and the united states is the difference in the level of strategic considerations the united states takes the whole world into consideration enabling it to look farther ahead our perspective is regional and that is why we are a notch inferior in our calculations the united states knows that under the present circumstances its position in asia cannot be shaken by the individual power of either china or japan and the sole possibility of anything happening is if china and japan join hands
3643777 gifts favors and banquets the art of social relationships in china
3643778 it is very easy for a federal politician or official to hide a gift worth up to 9 999
3643779 to give just one example to show how loophole filled the system still is
3643780 karlheinz schreiber and brian mulroney would still not be required to be publicly listed as in house corporate lobbyists as long as they lobbied less than 36 days every 6 months and schreiber could still give 300 000 in secret to some federal candidates and to all federal politicians political staff and public servants right after they leave office either as a donation or as payment for lobbying services and could give the same amount in secret to trust funds maintained by every federal political party and their riding associations
3643781 whole truth can be finally exposed and tarnished reputations restored i have come to the conclusion that in order to finally put this matter to rest and expose all the facts and the role played by all the people involved from public servants to elected officials from lobbyists to police authorities as well as journalists the only solution is for the government to launch a full fledged public commission of inquiry

3643807 this was good they have publicly stated their support for addressing our issues so now we have individuals we can hold accountable accountability is whats been missing all along

3643821 there is a perfect storm working in this country to privatize our health care system
3643822 local communities need to come together to defend access to local services and stop privatization
3643823 we will be continuing our drive into the northern parts of the province by mid february

3643830 an entrepreneurial thing but the uk is so buttoned down i never considered the idea of going into business for myself until i came here
3643831 but poorly executed we spent too much money up front there were a lot of things about publishing we didnt know we didnt know
3643832 a catbird seat to see nova scotia patronage politics close up
3643833 we lived in adjoining duplexes and we didnt pay ourselves at the beginning
3643834 we eventually realized we just couldnt crack it by sticking with sackville
3643835 wed been together for nearly 10 years we disagreed on the question of expansion and patrick said the hell with it he and joyce got out
3643836 diana felt she would like to get out she wanted security and she didnt want me and my ambitions to interfere with her security shed raised the kids handled the financial end of the business and the business had dictated her life for a long time she was for selling it
3643837 absurd diana and i chopped our share down the middle
3643838 i tried to do it top down spending money up front
3643839 we still each have to do other things in the off weeks
3643840 at this point theres no re sale value in frank and there probably never will be so ill never be financially secure but thats all right i have a small apartment an old car i dont need all that much
3643841 but i do think frank serves a useful purpose its very unlikely someone else would take it up if we werent doing it besides
3643842 its hard to teach an old dog new tricks im the kind of person who likes to bore down i do one thing at a time and thats it
3643843 strange guys with their hands folded and looking very stern
3643844 there is probably no large canadian city that is so badly served by its newspapers there is probably no news organization in the country that has managed to achieve such an intimate and uncritical relationship with the local power structure or has grown so indifferent to the needs of its readers
3643845 as any business does were continuing to evaluate all our costs but no decisions have been made about layoffs or cuts or anything like that whether it be pages or people
3643846 there will be one print source so thats one set of eyes thats one point of view that ultimately everything is being generated from and thats not good for our society and thats not good for our democracy
3643847 initially there were a few people that said oh boy is this ever weird
3643848 for the most part they are quite happy with it
3643849 its common for specialists to use this technology but not general practitioners
3643850 better access to primary care fewer residents not having access to primary care and less patients in the emergency department because we will have more clinics open
3643851 the government made clear today there would be no er closures but does that mean there will be no closures but you may be closing down so many hours a day or a week we have made it absolutely clear there will be no er closures until we are satisfied that a proven method could be put in place to replace the existing status quo of these ers

3643856 its at a point now that something has to be done now
3643857 have made it work up until now but i cant see how theyll be able to do it in september
3643858 as a means of partially justifying the existence of its fire services co ordinator position
3643859 unless amherst is willing to give a lot more than minor alterations
3643860 there are no negotiations to be had with the town of amherst
3643861 for very basic services we need to get them out and have services close to home thats what this clinic is its in the community its more responsive to the needs for those patients
3643862 like team approaches to primary care and an end to doctors being the be all and end all
3643863 i have a copy of the report here beside me
3643864 its three centimeters thick over an inch theres a lot of stuff in it but the devil is in the details
3643865 i hope people will understand he didnt get kicked out
3643866 to be able to enjoy our backyards and our families and not be invaded by unwanted intrusions
3643867 the geography does not readily provide for easy and inexpensive answers for an alternate route
3643868 how is it that the office of health protection and promotion is advocating for the use of atvs

3643884 discusiones internacionales sobre el estatus de osetia del sur y de abjasia y las formas de garantizar su seguridad estable
3643885 no queremos dejar ninguna duda al respecto y pienso que el presidente sarkozy est de acuerdo en eso la integridad territorial de georgia nunca puede ser puesta en duda bajo ninguna clase de proceso internacional
3643886 en este momento esto es provisional pero nuestra intenci n es hacerlo permanente
3643887 tomen medidas adicionales de seguridad antes de la creaci n de mecanismos internacionales
3643888 el presidente dijo que se elegir a los prefectos interinos en consulta con las regiones no se convocar a reuni n cerrada para elegir a las autoridades interinas ser en el marco de la mayor consulta posible ser n los mejores profesionales y la gente que goce de apoyo en sus regiones queremos hacerlo lo m s r pido posible y en ese mbito se est trabajando
3643889 las familias de bajos ingresos pueden ser llevadas hacia una mayor pobreza si los altos precios de los productos agr colas tales como el trigo el arroz y la semilla de soya permanecen consistentemente altos y los pa ses no logran aumentar su producci n agr cola ni los ingresos de los pobres
3643890 pero si no se dise an cuidadosamente estas pol ticas pueden ser contraproducentes porque podr an beneficiar a personas que no necesitan los subsidios y limitar an los incentivos para elevar la oferta de alimentos
3643891 esto es todo lo que yo hab a so ado en el podio estaba pensando en el pasado estoy casi sin palabras

3643895 themes such as abortion the family education and religious liberty the bishops of ecuador decided to discuss those points in the light of pronouncements by pope benedict xvi
3643896 the text is clear the rest is simply ignorance or bad faith to keep on playing the games of those groups who want power
3643897 it is not true that the constitution favors abortion it undoubtedly and clearly protects life and establishes protection and care from the very beginning that is conception
3643898 the new constitution recognizes a persons right to practice keep change or profess his religion in public or in private and to share it with others
3643899 we are worried that this invocation of an incan deity the paccha mama mother earth a divine being among the indigenous groups is a worship of paccha mama
3643900 to include it in the constitution is to return to a time hundreds of years ago when fire and air were worshipped
3643901 we the sovereign people of ecuador celebrate nature the paccha mama that we are a part of and that is a vital part of our existence
3643902 the existence of nature or paccha mama where we reproduce life has the right to be respected
3643903 is an eternal space where we live and of which we are a part pachakamak is our creator what the catholics call god and the evangelicals protestants call jehovah

3643911 merokok itu urusan masing masing kalau merokok haram ya memang kondisinya seperti itu 9 dari 10 orang yang sakit kanker paru paru akibat rokok datang saja ke rs dharmais lihat statistiknya
3643912 jangan malah membagikan rokok gratis itu mendorong anak dan remaja untuk merokok
3643913 di thailand toko yang menjual rokok tidak memajang produknya hanya disebutkan toko ini menjual rokok
3643914 kenapa singapura bisa menjual rokok dengan harga tinggi sedangkan negara kita murah dan mudah diakses
3643915 hanya dikembalikan sepertiganya saja dalam bentuk cukai itu adiktif tidak bisa berhenti sampai mati siapa yang bisa membenahi kalau bukan pemerintah
3643916 di singapura sudah thailand sudah gambarnya dirotasi tiap 3 bulan di negara kita cuma dikasih space kecil dengan tulisan yang kecil padahal ini penting untuk public education dan public awareness
3643917 sepanjang tahun ini kbri praha menyelenggarakan berbagai kegiatan kebudayaan di sejumlah kota di ceko yang didukung sepenuhnya oleh pemerintah media dan masyarakat ceko
3643918 karena banyak yang nampaknya tidak mengetahui bahwa indonesia dulu mempunyai hubungan sangat dekat dengan negara cekoslovakia
3643919 supriyadi bahkan tidak mengetahui jika kami sekeluarga berpindah ke blitar pada tahun 1952
3643920 dalam budaya jawa memang tidak bisa leluasa kaum muda berbincang bebas dengan yang lebih tua karena ada pembatasan
3643921 supriyadi baru mengetahui jika ibu kandungnya meninggal dunia sewaktu dewasa meski begitu kedekatannya dengan bu susileh memang lebih jika dibandingkan kedekatannya dengan ayah kandungnya
3643922 agar tidak sakit sakitan dalam budaya jawa seringkali penggantian nama dilakukan sebagai simbol tolak bala

3643931 directia management invatamant preuniversitar a ales sprijinul inspectoratelor scolare pe motiv ca odata cu postarea subiectelor pe site acum o saptamana si ceva editurile interesate au si scos culegeri si carti ce trateaza aceleasi subiecte se pare ca este un conflict de interese in interiorul acestui organism al ministerului educatiei foarte multi profesori autori fiind in relatii directe cu principalele edituri de carte scolara in aceste conditii ne putem astepta ca din partea inspectoratelor modificari de fond din continutul subiectelor
3643932 este normal sa solicitam inspectoratelor scolare sa vina cu propuneri si observatii deoarece profesorii autori au fost recrutati din toata tara de la toate disciplinele si de la toate nivelurile de pregatire a elevilor mai mult aceasta solicitare este foarte importanta deoarece avem nevoie de o baza si bineinteles subiectele gasite in neregula vor fi eliminate in privinta asemanarii acestora cu cele din culegeri si alte carti scolare mi se pare un lucru firesc deoarece nu exista cel putin la matematica probleme originale acestea circula se mai modifica pe ici pe colo sunt adaptate cu alte cifre si multe dintre ele chiar sunt copiate din culegeri vechi aparute inainte de 1990 o problema se inventeaza greu deci nu se poate vorbi de originalitate in fond culegerile seamana cu problemele de la bacalaureat pentru ca editurile s au adaptat la modele deja cunoscute pentru a si putea vinde marfa

3643937 we have got to be a little bit more unsporting or clever we dont encourage the players and i think its an english thing but our players are not used to going to ground i think if we would have twice they would have been big decisions for the referee
3643938 thats something we have got to learn over the course of the season if the players take on board what i have told them im sure well get that bit of luck we need sometimes
3643939 its not probably the right thing to do or say you have got to look at the game with colchester 1 0 up and even their supporters joined in and kept the ball their players have played at a level where they know 1 0 up away from home is a great result every free kick and goal kick is delayed
3643940 our players have got to learn a bit of that because sometimes we are a bit too eager and honest it can help at the end of the season by getting extra points or the next round of the cup
3643941 hes the only one who told me i was special
3643942 these additional voters guarantee virginia will be closer than its been before but closing that entire gap in one election is tough to do

3643950 saya mungkin memang harus mati kalau tidak oleh lawan bisa jadi oleh kawan yang tersesat situasi revolusi sekarang ini memang sudah begitu genting dan kaum imperalis telah berhasil mendalangi percekcokan percekcokan yang terdapat diantara kita dengan kita
3643951 tapi kalau andaikata saya mati juga nanti maka saya yakin kematian saya akan menjadi rabuk yang akan lebih mempercepat proses penyelesaian revolusi dan kepada bung bung dan kawan kawan lainnya saya pesankan supaya terus pegang teguh 5 sumpah dari barisan banteng republik indonesia sampai revolusi nasional selesai
3643952 saya adalah seorang pemimpin dan saya adalah juga seorang dokter percayalah bahwa dengan kepergian saya ini tidak akan terjadi apa apa saya tidak akan dibunuh oleh bangsa indonesia sendiri yang mau membunuh saya hanya belanda dan karena ada seorang anak yang harus segera saya beri pertolongan maka dalam keadaan semacam apapun saya sebagai dokter harus segera pula pergi untuk memberi pertolongan kepadanya lebih lebih anak itu harus segera menjalani operasi
3643953 our mla had promised to provide us with the chief minister awas yojna but ended up in smoke
3643954 the sdf government under the leadership of the chief minister pawan chamling corrected this historic blunder and approached the central leaders
3643955 should better understand that the functioning of the panchayat in sdf regime is much better than that in his tenure
3643956 although the numbers presented reveal interesting settlement patterns they do not allow us to say anything conclusive about relationships between parks and human livelihoods populations on pa edges could be high due to people being squeezed between multiple protected areas largescale farms and urban sprawl because of resulting landlessness and poverty people have concentrated in areas where tourists enter and exit pas in the hope of availing themselves of potential opportunities

3643962 als gevolg van een confrontatie met een reiziger met een persoonlijkheidsstoornis hebben we helaas een vertraging van 15 minuten opgelopen
3643963 a lot of women and children died here who do we blame you know the answer
3643964 i think that these bandits who did this must be killed it doesnt sound nice but its the truth
3643965 there is no way in good conscience that we could proceed with a joint naval exercise given the state of this crisis
3643966 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3643967 there is a text it has been accepted in moscow it was accepted here in georgia i have the agreement of all the protagonists
3643968 the territorial integrity and belonging of south ossetia and abkhazia to georgia can never be put under doubt
3643969 i promise you today that ill remind them of everything they have done and one day we will win

3643974 its time we catch up with the resk of the las vegas nevada politics business community and offer solid fringe benefits for our valued employees this new package will come at no cost to employees and will be underwritten by a solid insurance company the premium charge will be higher but were banking on the fact that las vegas nevada politics product sales will increase because our workers will be highly motivated to come to work each day
3643975 wed rather have a consistent share value over time versus a catastrophic loss of company value due to some frivalous lawsuit or liable charges the result of this decision will probably mean a 5 loss in share value for 6 months but then a slow steady recovery after that
3643976 our legal team has already thoroughly researched how to file an insurance claim for online business
3643977 mostly because we want to expedite the payout process should we have to make a claim the internet marketing world moves much faster than the physical marketing realm and as a result we would lose significant business from any down time associated with a drawn out insurance claim
3643978 we believe we have a right to the same protections afforded to offline businesses despite the fact that we dont have a physical place of business
3643979 once insurance companies buy into the online business sector theyre going to need able legal representation to avoid false claims likewise las vegas nevada politics businesses will need legal representation against these big time insurance companies in order to get the disbursements they deserve im excited about the possibilities
3643980 were already researching able counsel for labor union related insurance claimes
3643981 because we dont want to get screwed in the event an insurance claim is denied to a respective business
3643982 because they currently have a limited health and dental plan we want to give them the most benefits and protect possible because they are our greatest assets people forget that the cost of losing an employee to another las vegas nevada politics company sometimes outweighs the cost of keeping them onboard
3643983 ive served my tour as exasperated liberal and indignant citizen
3643984 i have been an avid voter al my life one whod never pulled a republican lever for any office on any ballot
3643985 im convinced that the national interest demands a new approach to our interaction with the world
3643986 part of it is political parties are a distant analog to families and you really hate to step outside a family environment
3643987 while john mccain has spent his career putting the country first ahead of personal and party interests sen obamas record is a lesson in partisanship
3643988 for me the national interest comes before party concerns particularly internationally
3643989 we do need a new direction in american policy and obama has a sense of that
3643990 he recognizes that a long term occupation of iraq is not only expensive its extremely dangerous to the american interests
3643991 he also recognizes that its preferable to speak with potential adversaries rather than simply shun them
3643992 theres a distinction between trumpeting issues and realistically looking at effectiveness
3643993 i have never known a time period where the american brand has been in less repair
3643994 if you ask americans of any political persuasion conservative liberal or moderate whether theyd rather see us lead the world with allies or alone most people instinctively say were better off with allies
3643995 the public does understand that something is not right about our policies today
3643996 that something extraordinary would soon happen to me i guess either i shall get married or i shall soon die
3643997 i hope that they never have to suffer the agony that they inflicted upon me

3644051 aber das ist nat rlich der nachteil der kleinen teams denn die k nnen das nicht
3644052 es ist in der aktuellen formel 1 das problem dass sobald ein auto etwas quer kommt dann die anstr mung f r den heckfl gel schlecht wird
3644053 dann dreht sich der fahrer das geht manchmal ganz schlagartig wir erinnern uns zum beispiel an den dreher von felipe massa in malaysia das war ein hochgeschwindigkeits dreher mit ber 200 km h schlagartig war das auto weg genau das soll verhindert werden diese flosse leitet die luft auf den heckfl gel wenn das auto quer kommt es ist quasi eine umleitung f r die luft dann gibt es trotzdem anpressdruck am heckfl gel auch wenn das auto mal in einen drift kommt
3644054 ja genau aber das will man ja auch haben das auto wird dann zus tzlich stabilisiert wenn es quer kommt bei geradeausfahren nicht weil dann steht es genau im luftstrom aber beim querstehen bremst es etwas wie ein segel
3644055 interessant ist daran dass die vorne am auto sitzen und auf den hinteren teil des autos wirken der frontfl gel und nat rlich auch die vorderr der verwirbeln die luft sehr stark der frontfl gel f hrt die luft nach oben und dann f ngt man sie oben wieder und leitet sie nach hinten damit man am heckfl gel eine ruhige luft hat im prinzip ist es eine umleitung der verwirbelten luft
3644056 ja weil das ist wohl etwas was sehr viel bringt die fl gel werden mehr und mehr manche arbeiten schon mit zwei davon das scheint sehr viel zu bringen zumal man in der allgemeinen aerodynamik beschr nkt ist wir k nnten ja nicht einfach gr ere heckfl gel montieren sondern m ssen m glichst viel luft dorthin bringen
3644057 f r mich haben wir die h sslichste formel 1 aller zeiten das ist wirklich schlimm
3644058 syndrome sets in the mind wanders and with it goes the flesh and then the toiletries
3644059 dunn is 20 walks from hitting 100 for the fifth straight year and only bonds has done 40 100 five in a row never babe ruth never ted williams no one but bonds and soon dunn
3644060 we set our price where we think it was fair
3644061 hes continued to hustle and hes played really well in right field
3644062 hes just in a little bit of a slump probably trying to do too much
3644063 coming back to philadelphia and working with bill bradshaw and his athletic support staff is what attracted me to temple university
3644064 i think its very simple weve been devastated by injuries
3644065 no team ive ever seen in baseball has been decimated like this it would kill any team
3644066 imagine the red sox without josh beckett and jon lester chien ming wang won 19 games two straight years joba chamberlain became the most dominating pitcher in baseball you cant lose two guys like that
3644067 theyre trying hard to win theres only so much you can do theyre not supermen
3644068 popping up faster than the fuzz on a teenagers upper lip
3644069 beer is a very very integral part of the world championships its the only proven performance enhancing substance we know of
3644070 there were a lot of things i was doing wrong
3644071 they know that were coming back to redeem ourselves and im pretty sure that they watch us a lot
3644072 has been circled on my calendar for about two years now
3644073 were preparing ourselves every night were showcasing what weve been doing the last three years getting ready for this moment so we cant afford to go out and be lackadaisical
3644074 continue to explore all available options in order to add an additional big man to our roster
3644075 growing up i always wanted to be an olympian and this is my third olympics
3644076 now to be the most decorated olympian of all time i just dont know what to say
3644077 he could have come here and been in three races and won three gold medals
3644078 but if he can do it he wants to do it hes amazing
3644079 four years ago i just wanted to race those guys
3644080 but i hate to lose and getting third in the 200m freestyle four years ago when i lose in circumstances like that it motivates me more to try to swim faster over the last four years that has made me a better swimmer
3644081 its been like a fast a super fast ride in a car
3644082 for me personally i usually get excited way too quick and then if i have a letdown i usually get pretty angry about it
3644083 he only did one event but boy did he knock it out of the park
3644084 as long as i live im always going to know that i was on the olympic team with these guys that i won a bronze medal with these guys its in the record book
3644085 to come here and lose in the first round like this it aint right man it dont seem real to me
3644086 every day every week every month even years that ive been working so hard for this and i came this far to lose in the first round again im not saying i failed myself but it should be the right scoring the scoring should be fair to everybody
3644087 for him to lose it could be disheartening for some of our other guys
3644088 thats going to be our biggest fear i think theyre most definitely going to be psyched out we have a psychologist around and were going to make sure she talks to the team im sure all of them are going to be psyched out
3644089 i didnt really know the score because it was so much going on in the crowd everybody was yelling and screaming
3644090 i was looking at some of my teammates and it sounded like they were saying move and some were just saying fight i thought i was up i thought i was up because i was scoring evidently i was down
3644091 raushee hit him he got a point twice and twice raushee threw punches and scored he also got points that determined the outcome of the fight
3644092 hes blocking me we went to the ground its football it happens off the field were friends on the field its a competition
3644093 i am extremely surprised because of the fact that i know the injury he had
3644094 sometimes you see him out there he looks like he is walking at 90 percent and all of a sudden hes in the game and playing at 100 percent great for j r
3644095 i kind of invented a brace it took me two years to get used to it but now i just play football i was determined to play it came down to hard work and believing in yourself when no one else did
3644096 eventually when im done playing im going to patent it
3644097 i finally landed back here which is a good place but its been a roller coaster
3644098 i made some mental errors here and there but everybody does you try to improve from there i want to start i know weve got a whole bunch of safeties but i want to start sometime i started three last year never know what could happen
3644099 i feel comfortable here its a very complicated defense but thats what i like about it youve got to be able to think a little bit you have to have smart safeties i think i can still play in this game
3644100 i dont want this year to be hampering me with injuries and stuff like that so that was the first thought that came into my head but i should be beyond that now
3644101 last year i missed all of training camp and came out and had a pretty good year
3644102 ive been dealing with adversity since ive been in the nfl
3644103 i give him some pointers and my opinion on the whole situation
3644104 we can relate to that definitely we have a good relationship my first year here he kind of has shown me the ropes sheldon brown too were all pretty tight
3644105 you dont know how many reps were going to get
3644106 im anxious to see us play a whole game i think the more time you have together the more comfortable and relaxed you are to play together
3644107 like ive said this is not the time to be talking about whos on the field and whos not on the field were getting ready to go into the season and if were going to go into the season and try to win and seriously be committed to doing it youre going to have to push your ego aside for a year
3644108 i love to compete when im watching film and i see my teammates out there competing and getting after it and making plays something just comes into me makes me want to get out there if my brothers are out there and im not out there its kind of frustrating but im back and feeling good
3644109 definitely i should have made that interception hands down nine times out of 10 i never miss that play but one play doesnt make a game we lost and life goes on you have to move forward
3644110 people can say whatever they want like i said one play doesnt make a game whoever said things im sure they had a couple messed up plays that had an effect on the game
3644111 she blossomed as a race horse just when hard spun retired
3644112 usually a good talker who liked to complain about social injustice but not too much
3644113 im sure hes been on his best behavior but hes been good
3644114 you put him in the middle of the lineup and he makes everybody better
3644115 not only manny but ex indian casey blake that gives them more balance in their lineup that gives them a better hitting team theyre tough but manny makes their lineup look completely different hes such a good hitter
3644116 once you get past ramirez youve still got james loney and russell martin and blake standing in there thats pretty good i had interest in blake he was in cleveland and i saw him when he was with the twins hes pretty good he can get big hits for you
3644117 that gal singer last night had a very large repertoire but fortunately her dress covered most of it
3644118 how beautiful it is and how easily it can be broken
3644119 im very proud to be an olympian now officially but were kind of putting that part of it behind us were here to get on the podium were here to win and to give our best performance were not happy with just being here
3644120 we face all of these teams that were going to play here we can play at that level we know we belong at this level and we want to perform a 1 1 draw is a point but we are disappointed we didnt put our best performance out there
3644121 we start at a younger age in that area its a little more well known when kids are growing up as opposed to soccer in other areas
3644122 were making leaps and bounds as far as our skill level goes
3644123 these young kids are the ones who are holding the standard for the group theyre kind of pushing us older kids
3644124 to have us back in the games as a female sport is phenomenal
3644125 thats something were proud of to have our young futures kids able to watch us on tv and see us in the media and be able to have those aspirations we did as kids watching the mary lou rettons of the world
3644126 we know what we have to do its a matter of executing those things we have been doing good defense and pitching
3644127 our goal always is to get to the world series
3644128 hes led this team to a super bowl went to the nfc championship a couple times so he definitely knows what hes doing and hes put a good program together
3644129 we feel like weve got a few guys who can get it done
3644130 we brought booker in we brought jamal jones in whos another good kick returner there of course weve got j r reed and weve got buck correll buckhalter desean is going to get some kick returns at some point
3644131 thats important having all five guys playing together with many reps because its critical that they play well together as a unit
3644132 unfortunately that bony piece is attached to the ligament and the tendon
3644133 you never want to say you cant but i would say that its highly unlikely that youre going to see tom gordon pitch this year for us
3644134 he definitely was one of the big parts of our bullpen and keeping him was something we definitely needed to do because he can go from the seventh or eighth and definitely close the game for you
3644135 were going to miss flash but somebody has to step up and do his job i know weve got the people down there to do that
3644136 i felt real good with what i did warming up i got up to where i normally would be and felt great so that gives me a good indication that im good
3644137 what can you say the last three starts have been great then you come into this one and i have the best stuff out of all those starts and get shoved what can you do
3644138 its a business decision and i think its a very calculated one
3644139 i dont think many of the clients that we work with make these decisions about spending you know a hundred or two hundred or 500 000 lightly and i think they see a return on that investment or they wouldnt be making it
3644140 were talking about 142 million in 2004 for the two conventions and at least 115 million and probably more in 2008 for the two conventions
3644141 the people raising the money also say to these companies and others look if you give money were going to set you up with elected officials at the federal level
3644142 the assumption is that even local companies which maybe are appealed to and are appealed to support this because it will kind of put our city on the map or maybe help us economically in the future in some vague way
3644143 but the truth of the matter is that the people raising the money also say to these companies and others look if you give money were going to set you up with elected officials at the federal level both host committees are doing this
3644144 i think under the new rules the ability for companies to lavish goodies on people at the convention has been greatly reduced
3644145 so you can come and have a hamburger or something to drink but i doubt thats going to change a lot of votes in the united states congress
3644146 weve been saying youre missing a great opportunity to get more of your people in here to celebrate your games
3644147 i would want to stress how important it is for the host city that the venues are seen to be full and everybody has the opportunity to enjoy the festivities
3644148 about two days ago i got pretty upset because since ive been here theyve tested me four times and they took blood a lot of blood
3644149 they are taking so much blood i am going to be very weak before the final of the 100 meters
3644150 its great to be an olympian but were trying to put that thrill behind us were here to get on the podium
3644151 fortunately for us weve seen this level and our coaches have put us up against the top four or five teams in the world consistently
3644152 so yeah were ranked 11th in the world but weve seen these teams before weve seen that level of intensity and we can play at that level its just a matter of being able to put it together for 70 minutes instead of 30 minutes here 25 minutes there
3644153 whether it be every single play clearing it out of the defense or putting the ball into the cage kind of that extra disciplined edge once we get that i think well be ok
3644154 it kind of bonds us together doing joke things i think the future of this team is from that area
3644155 even though we like to see ourselves as being in their company its a very tall order to win these games
3644156 it really is what the tie suggests we need to close the gaps and were disappointed we didnt come out with a win
3644157 just like skip we were fans of the team in the lean years in the 70s and the 80s
3644158 we tuned in to listen to the funny one liners
3644159 as ceo of the braves i declare today a public celebration throughout braves nation in honor of skip caray
3644160 the commissioner of baseball bud selig joins me in that proclamation
3644161 by my count thats nearly 5 000 games that we did together and it never got old
3644162 were always going to recall that attitude that made skip skip if he was here today and a foul ball was hit to you hed be able to tell you where you were from
3644163 so today instead of saying goodbye lets all just say thank you thank you skip for letting us all be a part of your life
3644164 ryan klesko is running the right routes we just cant get the ball to him
3644165 you all were the bass notes to the soundtrack of my fathers life
3644166 after i came out a lot of guys were really positive about how i played which feels good
3644167 they had her ready then they made her stop then they did it again they tried to break her concentration and they did it
3644168 i think they are going to see how it does in 3 weeks and see how it responds to being immobilized and go from there
3644169 these are certain things that happen sometimes to players when you think about sometimes the bone pulling off i know that sounds kind of odd but that actually happens sometimes its not the best case scenario it certainly isnt the norm but at the same time the hard part about it is that piece of bone isnt that big its not like you can just take a screw and fix it like a fracture you cant take a little pin and just put it in there so the best thing to do is to maybe let it scar back over and see what happens to it
3644170 i told you guys at the start of the season that he was one of the big parts of our bullpen and keeping him healthy was something we needed to do were going to miss flash somebody has to step up and do his job i know we have the people down there to do that
3644171 were in a position where we need to step it up
3644172 we need to try to see if we cant put a little bigger lead between us and the mets and the marlins weve got to win some games
3644173 were having trouble right now scoring runs through our lineup
3644174 on nights where we score a lot of runs our bottom of the lineup contributes when they dont contribute that cuts the game short
3644175 a lot of nhl players have come from that area and they just decided they would name the arena after a mother who has always been there
3644176 shes been going there for 80 years she always made sure her kids got there they even have a special seat for her in the building
3644177 she knows something is going on but she has no idea about the name
3644178 its going to be exciting for her and for us
3644179 i started playing there in 1958 it was the first indoor arena i ever played in
3644180 they had boards and no glass on the sides and the fans could reach over and make contact with the players
3644181 one time i was playing left wing and a guy came over and hit me pretty good and my mother reached over and grabbed his hair and said no one touches my boy
3644182 the guy was shocked i was shocked shocked and embarrassed
3644183 thats my mother shes a pretty rabid fan and to this day she lives and dies with the flyers
3644184 mother still goes there and watches the senior league games
3644185 south koreas park said yesterday that he will try his best to defeat you
3644186 so do you think in this planet is there anyone who can defeat you and if so who is it
3644187 to be at the top of so many great athletes
3644188 but it wasnt easy to put that race behind me
3644189 all the emotion that went into that relay i had friends texting me all afternoon saying i cant sleep im still fired up about that race and im not even out there
3644190 and im like well im not napping if you guys keep texting me
3644191 if we trained the horses like we did the people wed kill them
3644192 im awful at math during an interview session yesterday he admitted later that he has matured from a subject of the process to a student of it
3644193 i think the biggest part ive been able to improve on is my underwaters phelps said
3644194 for the first time ive been watching my kickouts my dives have been perfect the right number of kicks and the number of meters off the wall so im getting every little thing you can throw into the equation
3644195 i had to practice what i preach stay in the moment
3644196 i did look up at the scoreboard and notice but i quickly switched myself to our philosophy
3644197 he only did one event today and boy did he knock it out of the park
3644198 i just did one event these guys did the whole meet
3644199 i owed them more than anything i fed off their energy if i was there by myself i would have been soiling my pants
3644200 i knew this team whatever way we put it we could medal
3644201 we have a better three up three count team than people give us credit for
3644202 i know a lot of people doubted wed even make it to the second day we knew we could do this
3644203 we were the underdog team for sure we had to hit and we did
3644204 everyone was a little nervous freakin out a little bit about the meet we just talked to each other a long heart to heart
3644205 we figured were the underdog team weve got nothing to lose
3644206 who are these guys paul and morgan arent in we have zero olympic experience but youve got to talk about that stuff its looming i felt like my whole body got less tense
3644207 what the hell does it have to do with the facts what she looks looked like and what bearing does it have to the matter at hand what religion he was
3644208 to flee on bail she donned a red wig and disguised herself as a member of a mime troupe together with her alleged accomplice keith may
3644209 then resurfaced dressed as a nun a rope and handcuffs were in her car
3644210 police in kingston have issued cctv images of a man they wish to trace in connection with a
3644211 we will be giving out consumer loans to our customers and even those on employer guarantee
3644212 peaches first met max 23 a harvard graduate in anthropology two years ago
3644213 the couple who first met two years ago hooked up days after peaches dumped her singer boyfriend faris badwan
3644214 i spoke to him at the weekend and as far as he was concerned they were still together now he doesnt know whats going on
3644215 critics have already branded the nuptials a publicity stunt as drummeys band chester french is launching its first album next month
3644216 police in kingston have issued cctv images of a man they wish to trace in connection with a
3644217 the detection of a new avian influenza virus strain in africa raises serious concerns as it remains unknown how this strain has been introduced to the continent
3644218 it seems to be unlikely that wild birds have carried the strain to africa since the last migration of wild birds from europe and central asia to africa occurred in september 2007 and this years southerly migration into africa has not really started yet
3644219 it could well be that there are other channels for virus introduction international trade for example or illegal and unreported movement of poultry this increases the risk of avian influenza spread to other countries in western africa
3644220 the goal of this show is to have some level of substance and provide news
3644221 theres always going to be enough to do in 20 minutes of television thats much more of the challenge than are we going to be so slow that we have to do
3644222 most of the audience unfortunately hasnt seen a group of discussing it or done from an african american perspective
3644223 i think its a step in the right direction for the network
3644224 in terms of black america this type of dialogue takes place almost entirely via talk radio so its good to have another television vehicle in the mix and jeff johnsons appeal should help engage younger viewers most important i hope it allows for fresh voices and perspectives to join in the discussion the debate always benefits from new energy and ideas
3644225 we understand there are people who dont watch the network
3644226 this is the perfect kind of show to get them back to the network
3644227 i like the ride the style the weight i feel safe
3644228 the lincoln gets great gas mileage 22 mpg on the highway 15 16 in town
3644229 the money is being spent to improve the overall operations of the school and for the future of the school and it is being spent appropriately
3644230 ultimately we would like to see and im sure renaissance would like to see that money go into their program
3644231 but if theyre shut down they wont have a program for it to go into
3644232 this is costing people a lot of time money and heartache
3644233 its our responsibility to gather all the information thats available to us to determine whether our initial decision to not to renew should be sustained
3644234 thats really our responsibility im looking at this from our position as the school reform commission
3644235 when youre placed in a situation by the school district where you are under attack and your charter is not being renewed based on what we think is faulty data you have no choice but to defend the school
3644236 they need to defend themselves against some of the accusations that have been made
3644237 if you look at some of the studies renaissances academics are as good if not better than some charter schools that were renewed without question
3644238 the renaissance charter is not looking for this whole issue to go away
3644239 they understand they need corrective action and they are taking steps towards that
3644240 weve the ioc been saying youre missing a great opportunity to get more of your people in here to celebrate your games
3644241 i would want to stress how important it is for the host city that the venues are seen to be full and everybody has the opportunity to enjoy the festivities
3644242 nah i dont think so sheppard said when asked yesterday if this would be a problem for him
3644243 well yeah samuel said yesterday in his long delayed first media session of training camp when asked if he understood what sheppard is going through
3644244 we talk about it being that i went through a situation last year so i can give him my pointers and my opinion on the whole situation we can relate to that definitely
3644245 we have a real good relationship samuel said of sheppard
3644246 my first year up here he kind of shows me the ropes sheldon does too were all pretty tight its a good relationship its no bad blood with anybody a situation is a situation and everybody goes through a situation but that doesnt affect us we go out there weve got a job to do
3644247 im a competitor at heart i love to compete samuel said
3644248 when im watching film and i see my teammates out there competing and getting after it and making plays something just comes into me makes me want to get out there
3644249 i think hes learning it and picking it up as expected sheppard said of samuel
3644250 but weve still got a couple weeks before the season gets started hes still got a lot to learn and a lot of time to improve
3644251 i think the more time you have together the more comfortable and relaxed you are to play together brown said
3644252 all that will take care of itself when it needs to be taken care of
3644253 as much as possible he said he trusts the coaches to balance the healing of his hamstring against the need for familiarity
3644254 he said what he had to say brown said of sheppard who last week was critical of team owner luries contention that lito needs to improve his ypa or yards per pass attempt against him
3644255 a lot of unity out here a lot of unity a lot of love
3644256 i can feel the love and i can feel excitement he said
3644257 you know theyre talking mess and talking crud i definitely feel that they want to see me out there and see what i can do for the team
3644258 they got the hit where we couldnt in the ninth inning
3644259 its only a matter of time hes a tremendous pitcher hes going to win a lot of games
3644260 i was just frustrated with myself because i knew i had him
3644261 if i would have thrown it anywhere remotely in that zone i think he would have taken it for a strike and i just wasnt able to do it
3644262 and i was just frustrated just because when you know you have a guy you really have to execute and i wasnt able to execute
3644263 they know that were coming back to redeem ourselves and im pretty sure that they watch us a lot
3644264 has been circled on my calendar for about 2 years now
3644265 weve got veterans were preparing ourselves every night were showcasing what weve been doing the last 3 years getting ready for this moment
3644266 so we cant afford to go out and be lackadaisical
3644267 we were not looking ahead i thought we played with really good energy in spurts and played some really terrific basketball
3644268 our goal wasnt to win by a certain margin it was to really work hard and keep up our pressure and then once that was done we just worked on a few other things the main thing was just to keep some consistency so overall i was very pleased with tonight
3644269 right now were still negotiating i hope it comes to fruition but theres no deal yet
3644270 call right back but did not pelinka did not respond to several messages
3644271 local and regional volleyball news stories from around the world
3644272 aguero is an excellent player and she is also very strong she is now in the great pain of losing her mother and she is also striving to recover from the sadness
3644273 i want to stress that she has been going through a hard time both mentally and physically during the past three days she had spent more time in the plane than on the ground but i believe she can recover gradually
3644274 aguero now is back which make us even more confident in the rest of the matches she has always been an important player of the team and we will also give her support to help get over the hard time
3644275 your volleyball season is about to start and i know you want to learn the secrets of how the pros play like they do strengthen and improve your volleyball skills while playing for your high school and club team now learn early what indoor and beach volleyball olympians and professionals know about 1 the importance of gaining muscle strength for injury prevention gaining speed and increasing your vertical jump while training for volleyball 3 mental conditioning and gaining confidence in yourself and your game on and off the court
3644276 he had a big brother aura and i was shocked by the news of his passing
3644277 having just had a liver transplant at 43 i now focus more on health and good living ive even slowed down on cigars
3644278 a great family man he loved his family more than anything
3644279 then go out and get a hamburger sometimes id take a shower
3644280 i told him that i know i speak for every american when i say to him today we are all georgians
3644281 it is past time for the russian government to immediately sign and implement a ceasefire
3644282 russia must halt its violation of georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia with international monitors to verify that these obligations are met
3644283 today the killing goes on and the aggression goes on
3644284 to send a signal to any country that chooses to associate with the west
3644285 well daddy said that was a word from the war and to not say it in front of any germans but youre not german so i can say it for you
3644286 your money perish with you because you thought that the gift of god could be purchased with money
3644287 repent therefore of this your wickedness and pray god if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven you
3644288 for i see that you are poisoned by bitterness and bound by iniquity
3644289 this is my church and if you do not like it get out
3644290 plans to prosper you and not to harm you plans to give you hope and a future
3644291 for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church and he is the saviour of the body
3644292 the decision was brought about by our need to raise wholesale prices and retailers desire to continue to offer strongbow in a similar party pack format at the same price point
3644293 we seek to keep our confectionery affordable to offer value for money and therefore we have slightly reduced the size on some of the larger sharing packs
3644294 un regal n mijo pal stress la neta ni pa quejarme me traen musiquita cada semanita baja el vide n te va a encantar
3644295 youre bleeding and what in the hell is that beeping
3644296 i dont know i dont think i know anything anymore
3644297 well ryan let me tell you man its not worth it the drugs women and lack of sleep it all seems like a fun ride at first but take it from someone whos been on a few of lifes many highways
3644298 action news at seven this is jim stanley and we are at the scene of a brutal murder it seems that rock legend david crane has become that much more legendary as his body was apparently ripped open by some sort of energy pistol as you can see his body and the body of one body guard has been completely obliterated by the blast of this unknown weapon our only indication of the murder weapon being an energy pistol is the statement of a twelve year old female witness who was found nude under the bed of david crane the witness also claims that this murder was not the work of our local serial killer known only as the dealer she claims that the murderer announced himself as the deliverer and promptly fired his out of this world weapon
3644299 so when it came to doing what i wanted or doing whats right i just had to say screw it ill do it the right thing i mean
3644300 i got some more if you want to hear them
3644301 so i was locked in my own bathroom one of my towels jammed the hinge
3644302 whats amazing is how the dealer decided to choose david crane as his next victim and allowed to young woman found at the scene to live
3644303 id expect you to say that you dont know that it was a man and furthermore you would praise the efforts of a dangerous psychopath only on the grounds that he spared the life of a woman
3644304 well forget that anyone who rips someones guts out with an axe and then turns two other human beins into a picasso of their former selves is a sick freak
3644305 the dealer kills prostitutes and homeless women this deliverer killed a man who was fortified in a private hotel suite after managing to neutralize two armed guards and then had the heart to spare the life of the young woman
3644306 either way hes killing people and he should be stopped
3644307 listen man i want you to be straight with me
3644308 on me buddy go home and get some rest after you finish that
3644309 seven thirty means its time for our pre recorded interview with sister mary who is a proud member of the church of septimus which was founded by the good father orourke
3644310 its a pleasure to have you here sister the efforts made by your church to aid the abandoned children of this city have inspired other cities to follow suit
3644311 its like a wonderful dream the smiling faces of children the laughter as they are finally able to put their troubles behind them once and for all
3644312 speaking of dreams i understand that sartain industries have invested a great deal of revenue into the church for what they call research into some sort of dream machine
3644313 were a church a house of god money invested into our church is meant for the continued blessing of those who wish to join our communion
3644314 look ive got nothing but nice things to say about your church it just seems strange that literally millions of dollars have been invested and all the church has to show for it is its simple appearance and odd location in the slums of this city
3644315 robert ill have you know that our intentions wouldnt mean a thing if we were located in a wealthy district of this city the money invested in our church has gone toward efforts to spread the word of god to other nations and provide care for the less fortunate
3644316 i honestly have no idea what you are talking about
3644317 listen my producers or one of our journalists must have thrown that on the promter to make me look silly on tv my apologies sister
3644318 after the news live from the channel six studio its the inquisition we go one on one with the man himself the most untouchable man on the planet general sterling he will bring his five star presence into my arena of thought i will ask about the ongoing proxy wars in the middle east africa and eastern asia i will also ask about accusations of
3644319 untouchable freaking untouchable santa knew something my dreams arnt just forcing horrific images onto me theyre telling me what to do with riddles my thoughts become code i cant decifer i am below noone noone
3644320 none are below me either i couldnt kill someone if i know that theyre weak weakness is a blessing how dare we judge weakness and for that matter end a life for it i care for everyone though not caring for them much my mind is a playground for intrusive thoughts it seems that the most discreet ideas command the most of my attention thoughts that have no reference something from nothing everything has a source the dreamweb has a source
3644321 this is an invitation only event you look like you just crawled out of a public toilet
3644322 you dont even have your eyes open are you blind
3644323 get the fuck out of here shit head ill fucking kill you if you dont
3644324 if you try to jump that bar i have to hit the alarm
3644325 im still a lady of the night ive set my sights a little higher
3644326 fine here take my pass ill say i lost it
3644327 shut the fuck up and be a good little whore
3644328 no this is your arena you are all julius caesar on this eve
3644329 without further ado let us crawl into the mind of our featured guest
3644330 ill let you get away with that one sir is fine
3644331 well sir you are taking one hell of a risk by appearing on my program
3644332 i dont take risks everything i do is a part of an infallible strategy
3644333 and i never tolerate failure i command an army of proffesional young men who would gladly die for the good of this nation
3644334 alright enough of this lets get down to what people really want to hear some people say that your efforts around the world to destroy what you call terrorism is merely an effort to reap the resources of their nations so they can become more readily available to your friends within sartain industries
3644335 you mentioned something before about this being a risk for me
3644336 this isnt exactly the subterranean bunker that youre used to
3644337 there are those of us who have achieved a more human than human presence few in this world succeed at everything fail at nothing my life is a virtue unto this world my mind interprets the true nature of this world through thoughts that occur to me in nano seconds i simply cannot die
3644338 so what youre saying is that you could just walk across a mine field and nothing would happen
3644339 what i am saying you mongrel is that for a mind to consider me as a target of harm is impossible all minds are slaves to their unique definition of reason i am able to define reason to any mind in existence
3644340 have children from warring countries fought on behalf of your effort
3644341 thats general sterling and that question wasnt provided to me before hand
3644342 yes alright its true we provide our questions to our guests before hand i apologize to anyone who may have been fooled
3644343 the custodians office is down the opposite hall from how you got here past the reception
3644344 surely they would have thought of something more clever than this
3644345 and we are back on the air im so sorry about the delay ladies and gentlemen the weather has been just awful
3644346 you are gonna get it prison is too good for you
3644347 im going to lock you away for good lock you away in that mind of yours
3644348 gabriel sartain is a very powerful man you will command the dreamweb in your effort to end him your targets grow in power as time passes as do you
3644349 we believe it would have been far better if kpmg had contacted our members to check the accuracy or otherwise of data and at least get their views
3644350 we think it a reasonable proposition that the industry would have at least been consulted and asked for input into the report
3644351 vodafone rejects the kpmg report because it is selectively modelled on out of date information
3644352 we will make sure there is a free flow of goods people and expression during the 2010 olympic games
3644353 i think we are already seeing some improvements i think we will see more
3644354 i think people who come from outside vancouver will see communities striving to be even better there will be significant improvements
3644355 i believe we are making some significant steps to improve the lives of those in the downtown eastside
3644356 i dont see this as an area of problems i see this as an area of possibilities
3644357 ive got three domestic reporters who are asking all the questions
3644358 were dealing with it because we think its important to make it a healthier community to live in were dealing with literally thousands of citizens who have significant challenges in their lives
3644359 its not something that can be done quickly if it was it would have been solved across the country and around the world
3644360 just as beijing has rolled out the red carpet so will vancouver in 2010 welcome the world
3644361 we are working to make those neighbourhoods healthier with better services for people
3644362 in canada we will be open to opportunities for people to express whatever views they have
3644363 there will not be opportunities to break the law but we will make sure there will be full and equal expression throughout the 2010 olympics
3644364 i think the chinese media get so tired of people coming here and criticizing china about its human rights that they wanted to point out canada has problems too
3644365 clearly the rock slide that took place on the sea to sky highway was something that wasnt expected
3644366 i can tell you i am always hopeful that we will receive approved destination status
3644367 but i can tell you that even without that weve seen significant increases in chinese tourists who come to british columbia
3644368 it will have everything from broadcast feeds for television to green screens used for camera backdrops
3644369 plans are in the works for a community called geos to operate completely without fossil fuel the plan is to build a community of affordable housing not just for the rich elite that run on solar power on sunny days and geo power on cloudy days
3644370 ten people were killed and 24 were injured in the bombing
3644371 i feel very excited because we sacrificed a lot to win this gold medal and this is a direct competition between the chinese team and the usa team and we are very proud that we won
3644372 i didnt expect this medal my coach told me that even eighth place would be okay
3644373 other swimmers have endurance but my advantage is speed i gave it all that i had hopefully the bronze medal will encourage our team
3644374 i think it is a decision of the group of the directors together they are to achieve the most theatrical effect for the benefit of the whole performance the whole opening ceremony
3644375 i do not see there is anything wrong with it
3644376 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
3644377 he told us there was a problem that we needed to fix it so we did
3644378 the olympic games is every four years and this race is one day and you cannot give up until you cross that finish line
3644379 someone told me at the top that i had the best time but i really couldnt celebrate until the last person crossed the finish line
3644380 if youre less aerodynamic but more comfortable and you can go faster then its worth it
3644381 i knew when i came here in december when it was freezing and snowing that it was a hard climb
3644382 i knew when i was four seconds down from emma that i had to turn it on in a big way i knew they would both be strong on the downhill
3644383 i heard on my radio earpiece that i was behind emma
3644384 i knew she was a strong rider but i wasnt too worried i knew the best part for me was still to come
3644385 this course was uphill so it didnt really suit me
3644386 you have to change a lot of gears and change the rhythm a lot so its really demanding
3644387 i dont know how much time i have left to live but on this occasion i give my pledge to lead an exemplary life
3644388 considering the defendant deeply regrets his crime and has voluntarily disclosed the assets
3644389 this was an assault in my mind i am incredibly angry about this
3644390 i tried to explain to them that i was a british journalist but they would not even let me take out my identifiction documents they were very rough
3644391 i am just wondering where this fits in with chinas solemn undertaking to allow us to report freely during the olympics
3644392 to win the fight against malaria we must attack the disease on many fronts
3644393 exxonmobil is committed to this battle which is why were doing everything we are from helping to develop new drugs facilitating the delivery of insecticide treated bed nets to places where they are desperately needed and supporting programs that prevent the spread of the disease
3644394 exxonmobil has been a corporate leader in the fight against malaria and we are delighted by their support for our work
3644395 this funding will greatly strengthen the pioneering malaria control and elimination efforts under way in southern africa and link them more effectively to similar work in other parts of the world
3644396 malaria knows no borders it cannot be eliminated in any one country unless we tackle it together as a regional strategy
3644397 elimination of this disease requires new levels of regional and international cooperation
3644398 a major methodological obstacle considering clinical drug trials of early alzheimers disease
3644399 this study supports the use of c pib pet in the evaluation of beta amyloid deposition in for example mild cognitive impairment alzheimers disease or normal pressure hydrocephalus
3644400 large and prospective studies are required to verify whether c pib pet will become a tool in diagnosing alzheimers disease another potential use of c pib would be the quantitative monitoring of beta amyloid deposits in the brain in subjects under treatment in pharmaceutical trials of early alzheimers disease targeting amyloid accumulation
3644401 if you had to pick one thing to make people healthier as they age it would be aerobic exercise
3644402 the health benefits of exercise are greater than we thought
3644403 we know that deaths come one to a customer eventually we will have a 100 percent mortality rate in both groups
3644404 when we first began there was skepticism about our ideas
3644405 these analyses confirm the validity of our anti melanoma program using our models we have repeatedly demonstrated that vitiligo derived igg preparations can prevent tumor growth further we have observed a dose response to vitiligo derived igg based therapy
3644406 these positive results continue to keep us on track to file our ind with the u s food and drug administration in the near term
3644407 approval from the fda demonstrates that absorber and the xm one transplantation test meet the tough requirements of the u s market now we can market and sell xm one full on in the u s initially focusing on the kidney transplantation segment followed by a next step into the heart and lung transplantation segment
3644408 xm one adds critical supplementary information to a transplantation clinics decision making process in their quest to minimize risk and rejection reactions
3644409 this is why it is of the outmost importance that every kidney available for transplantation is properly utilized that is to say that the right kidney is matched with the right recipient the total number of kidney transplantations per year globally is 56 000 of which 17 000 take place in the u s this makes the u s the single largest market in the world
3644410 interest in xm one in the u s market is already considerable and the first orders are expected shortly
3644411 caregivers have a long exposure to stresses and losses from the dementia and fatigue that comes from caring for their spouses so they experience fewer positive emotions
3644412 some may have feelings of guilt about participating in activities with friends or in the community when their loved ones are no longer able to do so
3644413 specific effects of caring for a spouse with dementia differences in depressive symptoms between caregiver and non caregiver spouses
3644414 these results are the first to prospectively quantify changes in alcohol use in relation to recent combat deployments interventions should focus on at risk groups including reserve guard personnel younger individuals and those with previous or existing mental health disorders further prospective analyses using data from this study group will evaluate timing duration and co existing illnesses of alcohol misuse and other alcohol related problems better defining the long term effect of military combat deployments on these important health outcomes
3644415 the clearance of the ind for pmx 60056 represents a major milestone for polymedix
3644416 this novel heptagonist compound is the first of its kind and represents a fundamental potential breakthrough for both cardiothoracic surgery and the treatment of bleeding problems with low molecular weight heparins pmx 60056 is the only compound in clinical development intended to reverse the activity of lmwhs and heparin we are proud to be the first and only company to be developing this completely new type of drug to address major clinical needs and market opportunities we are also very proud of our productivity and efficiency as this is our second regulatory clearance in the past three months
3644417 age adjusted death rates have reached record lows and life expectancy has reached record highs in recent years likely due to a combination of behavior and societal changes as well as improved medical and surgical therapies
3644418 with the rise in life expectancy it becomes necessary to focus on improving the quality of life and functional abilities as people reach older ages regular exercise including running may contribute to improved health among older adults
3644419 the higher levels among controls translate into important differences in overall daily functional limitations
3644420 disability and survival curves continued to diverge between groups after the 21 year follow up as participants approached their ninth decade of life
3644421 our findings of decreased disability in addition to prolonged survival among middle aged and older adults participating in routine physical activities further support recommendations to encourage moderate to vigorous physical activity at all ages
3644422 increasing healthy lifestyle behaviors may not only improve length and quality of life but also hopefully lead to reduced health care expenditures associated with disability and chronic diseases
3644423 with hunger on the rise we are doing our best to stream incoming contributions to the people most in need in africa asia and the caribbean
3644424 it is essential to launch a bold new set of responses to stem a full blown hunger and nutritional crisis
3644425 food prices are not abating and the worlds most vulnerable have exhausted their coping strategies
3644426 our action plan is targeted and customized to help the most vulnerable meet their urgent needs
3644427 unlike the intravenous drug application of oxycyte in traumatic brain injury this would be a topical application applied to the skin or to the surface of wounds so were hopeful that the clinical review process would be as a medical device which can be shorter and faster than review as a drug
3644428 if the safety efficacy cycle is indeed shorter as i believe it can be then it suggests that substantive partnering models could be launched shortly after safety and efficacy are proven
3644429 while im excited about this new potential use for oxycyte i know that the big question on our shareholders minds right now is the status of our phase iib protocol for oxycyte in tbi were not going to get into the details of our communications with the fda that would not be in the best interests of the company or the process ill just say that positive communications are continuing and that when there is news well announce it
3644430 in both canada and the united states general health insurance covers medical payment for eye injury and various eye diseases such as cataract glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy and optional vision insurance provides additional insurance coverage for eye examinations contact lenses and eyeglasses and or frames and in some instances part of the costs for elective laser surgery for vision correction
3644431 many americans and canadians have publicly funded or private coverage for optional vision care
3644432 the difference in use of eye care services between americans without health insurance and canadians narrowed when adjusted for income level and was almost eliminated when adjusted for having optional vision insurance
3644433 among adults with vision problems a public health gap exists in actual access to eye care services between canada and the united states primarily owing to the population without health insurance in the united states
3644434 however although health insurance is associated with increased use of preventive services and recommended treatments simply providing health insurance to all persons may be insufficient to increase the percentage of individuals who use eye care services or to improve vision related outcomes economic status and optional vision insurance are also significantly associated with rates of use of eye care services
3644435 therefore public health interventions targeting adults with vision problems without health insurance might be more beneficial if they focused on those at risk for serious vision loss especially those in the lowest income group
3644436 because many prostate cancers grow slowly early detection may not benefit a patients health and in some cases may even cause harm
3644437 we encourage men younger than 75 to discuss with their clinicians the potential but uncertain benefits and the possible harms of getting the psa test before they decide to be screened
3644438 the lowest 25 oh d quartile less than 17 8 nanograms per milliliter is associated with a higher risk of all cause mortality in the general u s population
3644439 further observational studies are needed to confirm these findings and establish the mechanisms underlying these observations if confirmed randomized clinical trials will be needed to determine whether vitamin d supplementation at higher doses could have any potential benefit in reducing future mortality risk in those with 25 oh d deficiency
3644440 refractive error is therefore the most common condition affecting the ocular health of the u s population involving young adults middle aged persons and older adults of all ethnicities
3644441 accurate current estimates of the prevalence of refractive error are essential for projecting vision care needs and planning for provision of vision care services to the many people affected
3644442 viread will be an important new treatment option and its approval represents a significant step forward in the fight against chronic hepatitis b
3644443 the approval of viread for hepatitis b represents more than a decade of work in both the fields of hiv and hepatitis b to develop a medication that offers significant viral suppression once daily dosing and a well established safety profile
3644444 we extend our thanks to the investigators and patients who participated in the clinical trials that support todays approval and we look forward to partnering with community members to increase disease awareness and expand access to treatment for those patients in need
3644445 although weve made great strides in reducing the overall incidence of chronic hepatitis b in the united states the disease still takes a devastating toll in asian american communities
3644446 greater public awareness and effective new treatment options are urgently needed to help reduce this significant health disparity
3644447 heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death and disability for men and women in the industrialized countries and throughout much of the world
3644448 over the past two decades we have witnessed impressive strides and explosive growth in the field of cardiology
3644449 thousands of scientists and clinicians around the globe are committed to the fight against heart disease and these award recipients are being honored today as the heroes in that fight
3644450 we are proud of them and pleased to be able to recognize them for their uncompromising approach to their work it gives me great pleasure to stand in the company of these pioneers
3644451 egyptian bureaucracy is amazing we sat had tea filled out forms and were told okay youre ready to go now just go over to that office there and fill out one more form linda told daily news egypt
3644452 were completely exhausted since wednesday morning until now weve only slept a cumulative 10 hours
3644453 because turkey is a muslim country and i had thought they would support and empathize with gaza
3644454 syrian authorities even provided us with a security convoy all the way to the border
3644455 its just been such a long journey it would be fantastic if we could enter and deliver the medicine save some lives
3644456 but i dont think it will be easy i think well need to get help from our scottish parliamentarians
3644457 we spoke with a doctor in one of gazas hospitals hes desperate for the medicine and equipment were bringing hes particularly thrilled about the endotracheal tubes used in surgery that we are bringing as he says they are re using the only tubes they have right now
3644458 the officers here denying you entry are taking orders from higher powers
3644459 israel is trying to wipe out the younger population if young people die there is no future for palestinians in the area
3644460 remind the world that we will not stand by and watch 1 5 million people suffer death by starvation and disease
3644461 past records wont count now sony is a very tough attacking player i know his game well but this may change for the olympics here so i have to make sure i am in the best condition to face him
3644462 i have played all my two matches on the same court and i am playing more consistently and making less mistakes
3644463 i dont think of anything else except my own game chong wei is looking in good form here but i am confident i have my own strength
3644464 i hope one day harakah will be a daily newspaper to replace the mainstream media which is no longer relevant
3644465 it was a competitive session today and we need to bring that on the weekend
3644466 thats whats been missing at the start of the last few games and were super keen to turn that round
3644467 murph has got a little bit of venom in him so when you wind him up the wrong way he can get a bit nasty
3644468 probably the last three weeks weve been trying to pick up our defensive side of things physicality and that sort of stuff
3644469 on the weekend the first 25 minutes of the game was just not acceptable
3644470 it took us halfway through the second quarter to realise that which was the disappointing part
3644471 weve got to continue working on it weve still got some light frame bodies but weve really addressed that hardness issue and that was the most disappointing part on the weekend
3644472 were not playing bad full games were probably putting together a quarter thats really hurting us at the moment
3644473 we see ourselves as a mentally strong group but we let ourselves down in that area against north
3644474 were not a good enough side to flirt with our form
3644475 we were out to win the kangaroos game and that was disappointing we didnt and now weve got to beat brisbane who are fighting for their life as well
3644476 if we go into the finals losing three or four in a row its so hard you just cant switch on the light
3644477 pada kenyataannya 50 ekonomi dunia masih dikendalikan oleh amerika serikat dan eropa sehingga cukup sulit bagi emerging market seperti asia menjadi penyelamat ekonomi dunia dengan segera
3644478 kami melihat beberapa pandangan yang beranggapan bahwa pemulihan ekonomi dunia dapat diwujudkan dalam waktu cepat agak kurang realistis
3644479 oleh sebab itu butuh waktu bagi asia untuk berkembang hingga dapat mendrive pemulihan ekonomi dunia
3644480 namun kami melihat emerging market seperti cina dapat dijadikan penopang pemulihan ekonomi dunia sebab cina yang sedang berkembang akan membutuhkan investasi besar di sektor infrastruktur
3644481 jepang dan korea misalnya mereka cenderung mengarah pada pengembangan energi terbarukan untuk negara negara seperti indonesia brasil dan sebagainya cenderung mengarah pada komoditas perkebunan dan pertambangan
3644482 ya mereka memberikan penjelasam mereka memang mencabut izinnya dengan perhitungan kalau harus melakukan penjualan 20 persen lagi nantinya itu mereka akan mencatat kerugian dengan harga penjualan nanti jadi masalah accounting sebenarnya
3644483 yang pasti dari kami peraturan tetap dilaksanakan tidak ada pengecualian dan peraturan itu sendiri sudah memberikan kemungkinan adanya jangka waktu yang bisa diperpanjang
3644484 its a tougher gig for a young man to play in a big mans role at a young age 19 when their bodys growing theyre still developing theyre giving away weight experience the whole lot
3644485 a first year kid playing in the ruck pinch hitting in attack at times and hes not getting the ground time of some of the others
3644486 so when you look at his 12 possessions or 14 possessions and you say that was his game but when you analyse the time he might have played 54 per cent of the game which is a fantastic result for a big fella
3644487 am visat c o s o bat c ndva pe ryoko am nvins o azi n cea mai important zi care a devenit i cea mai important zi din via a mea

3644518 those guys were too small to serve me todd stepped up about 95 percent of the time
3644519 our customers have told us what they want our priorities to be and what they would be willing to pay for what we have produced reflects these views
3644520 we face a 655m programme of work to deliver 329 projects more than anywhere else in the uk specifically for legislation imposed on us from europe we also have to spend 450m to cater for growth in the south east region
3644521 we have no choice but to do this and it is not possible to meet these requirements which make up nearly half of our proposed spending programme and cover increased power costs without price rises and borrowing substantial amounts of money
3644522 water and sewerage prices between 2010 and 2015 need to be set in line with what customers are willing and able to pay and companies should deliver a package of benefits in line with what consumers see as a priority
3644523 this new wind farm demonstrates our commitment to dramatically increase the amount of energy we generate from renewable sources helping to cut the uks carbon emissions and secure our energy supplies
3644524 sheringham shoal will be the uks fourth largest offshore wind farm approved to date and will help provide a significant contribution towards our renewable energy targets
3644525 companies want to build here because we have made the uk one of the most attractive places to invest in wind power
3644526 if the uk is going to realise its ambitions for clean energy this potential must be realised this project is a major step for the uk receiving clean energy
3644527 i think its been seriously affected if you go to any part of somalia be it in the north where its been more settled and peaceful and less affected by the conflict we still see an annual occurrence of drought and its an issue thats been going on for several years there are certainly ways that can be improved by looking at strategies such as rainwater harvesting ground water management which are all affected by the climate as well
3644528 we believe that young people especially in countries like somalia that are suffering from civil conflict can play a major role they are usually the ones who are most active in their families theyre the most mobile in the family they can take the initiative and start to do environmental programs within their communities they can talk to their peers they can talk to their families and at the same time they can talk to their teachers and other colleagues they have a bigger outreach than the elders who are taking care of families they the ones who have more flexibility to move around
3644529 they have access to the internet they have access to knowledge and they can use that in a much quicker manner than other segments of the population and theyre the future theyre really the future of the country and they have to take that initiative
3644530 in the rest of somalia its relatively peaceful and we have been able to do some development programs now we feel that even in areas which are affected by the conflict and we know this from first hand knowledge young people are looking for an outlet theyre looking for ways that their lives can become normal
3644531 so i think with that extra energy and motivation theres always space to bring that out and thats why young people are such a resource
3644532 we cant be overcritical of american publishers for cowering under terrorist threats after all the guardian like every other british newspaper lacked the gumption to publish the danish cartoons but all who care about free speech have a duty to make this sort of censorship counterproductive random house should pay this author substantial compensation and the book should be placed on a website so everyone can read it
3644533 might be offensive to some in the muslim community but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
3644534 we stand firmly by our responsibility to support our authors and the free discussion of ideas even those that may be construed as offensive by some however a publisher must weigh that responsibility against others that it also bears and in this instance we decided after much deliberation to postpone publication for the safety of the author employees of random house inc booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the book
3644535 frankly im more afraid of global warming than of terrorist attacks
3644536 i did expect my book would be controversial just because im a pink woman writing about a culture that was not my own and a religion that is not my own but my aim was not to provoke it was to portray the difficulty of being a woman in that era and to portray this wonderful heroine who overcame obstacles to become a prominent figure in islam
3644537 i pulled myself up to my windowsill and peered into the stars imagining they were the one thousand and one eyes of al lah when he looked at me what did he see inferiority a shrunken soul a light that shone more feebly than that of a man or did he see what i felt a bright burning like the bush hed inhabited the day hed revealed himself to moses
3644538 this was the beginning of something new something terrible soon i would be lying on my bed beneath him squashed like a scarab beetle flailing and sobbing while he slammed himself against me he would not want to hurt me but how could he help it its always painful the first time
3644539 my portrayal of muhammad is extremely respectful and of the origins of islam is very accurate and respectful
3644540 muhammad says in the koran that he was a mortal
3644541 im glad the story has come out because now any publisher who takes it on will do so with eyes wide open im hoping to find someone who is as passionate as i am and my agent is
3644542 preplanned cold blooded pre meditated murder of a small country
3644543 either we have to try to remove the russians by force or accept a humiliating defeat
3644544 unless you send u s troops and nato troops you will not be able to remove russian troops from south ossetia
3644545 it would require war and i dont think we are ready for that
3644546 if we want to get serious about addressing the root causes of global warming then lets draw down the empty rhetoric and start taking concrete actions
3644547 a lot of people dont realize that their homes and businesses create a significant portion of our carbon footprint so today by signing these strict green building standards into law were saying enough is enough
3644548 lets end the stale promises emphasize conservation and tackle climate change on all fronts
3644549 david adroitly walks the line between giving his core fans their fill of vocal runs while showing enough restraint that he wont automatically alienate non idol loving listeners
3644550 just listened to the thing six times in a row and were not terribly angry about spin seven
3644551 effortless glides into falsetto and some rousing moments in the bridge and chorus
3644552 we are the last generation with the opportunity to tackle climate change this is the naked truth
3644553 malil and the victim had apparently been in a dating relationship which recently ended
3644554 most of us fled from kumisar afdub rebo omar don and dhur dher locations in kalafe district of the somali region of ethiopia
3644555 we were farming communities some of us fled during the war while others arrived following the drought that hit the region
3644556 it seems the international community forgot us when siad barre was overthrown
3644557 things changed with barres removal from office since then we have not gotten much help only acpo a local ngo has supplied us with some food we could not flee the latest hostility in beletweyne because we are poor people and we dont know where to go
3644558 they have not had much to eat since fighting between insurgents and government forces erupted in the region
3644559 i didnt write this wikipedia entry it may look like i did but i didnt im a published writer so its not inconceivable that one of my many hot young fans citation needed wrote this ill look it over though just to make sure everythings accurate yup looks good
3644560 whether its a death sentence or a life sentence at the moment we are glad that there has been a resolution
3644561 i hope that the appeal process will be a lot quicker than the trial process
3644562 given the past track record of this matter it could be years before the appeal is heard or resolved
3644563 i just heard a huge bang and the house shook and i thought not again
3644564 its happened heaps of times before you get up pull your clothes on and run out the door
3644565 usually its just a few cuts and grazes but when i saw how bad it was i thought its happened its a fatal my heart just sank
3644566 i called emergency and grabbed my fire extinguisher and bolted up the road
3644567 he the driver of the first b double was running back from the scene just hysterical
3644568 there were other truck drivers who had stopped and were covering up the body on the road
3644569 i jumped up into the cabin of the second b double and checked if he was still breathing but i couldnt find a pulse
3644570 at this stage it is too early to determine what caused the crash
3644571 as the truck came around the bend it went right up on its side it just missed me
3644572 if my car wasnt so low it probably would have got me
3644573 we have been able to identify a corrosive on board the truck which is why we are wearing splash suits and breathing apparatus
3644574 this isnt a decision which we have taken lightly but it is one which we believe will guarantee the future of the club
3644575 we held a special general meeting for the clubs executive and board last thursday to discuss the issue and after weighing up our options the vote was unanimously in favour of pursuing the move
3644576 the previous sunday we held a club day and put the proposal to the players and after talking about the future of the club they were in agreement with the proposed move
3644577 there is still a long way to go and we have to submit letters to the northern rivers regional rugby league stating the reason behind our wishing to apply for permission to go across the border
3644578 any submission then has to go to the country rugby league crl for their consideration and if approved we will then have to apply to the queensland rugby league qrl and the gold coast rugby league gcrl for registration in their competition
3644579 we need to be able to attract players to the club supporters to our ground and reduce our expenses so we can channel that back into rugby league
3644580 this is a big move for the club but one we feel we have to make
3644581 its a shame because our under 18s are travelling well and could be in the grand final and we dont want to jeopardise their chances
3644582 this opportunity allows politicians to work with employees and management to hear what they have to say in regards to government regulations and everyday challenges
3644583 today has brought to my attention again what actually happens on a daily basis to keep a business on its feet
3644584 surprisingly ive been specifically asked by a customer today to make their coffee
3644585 i think the pollies need to spend a little more than a couple of hours to fully appreciate the work involved but the principle is that they are willing to hear the issues we have
3644586 he doesnt make a bad coffee and he is genuinely taking an interest in the business
3644587 there are many challenges faced by small businesses that directly relate to government so this really is a positive step in the right direction
3644588 i know the important role small businesses play in the community so this opportunity gives them the chance to raise their concerns directly with me
3644589 shes never done too good since she had the flu needle and shes had this cough for two or three months
3644590 but she seems to be coping pretty well and the vet has checked her out and said theres nothing wrong with her and shes been working pretty well
3644591 but some of the horses might find it hard on the hill up if they havent been here before
3644592 i have something to tell you and please forgive me if its going to break your heart
3644593 ive actually had make a flight reservation the other day ive contacted the hotels manager for room reservation and i even called the florist shop the idea was to ring your door bell and hand over a bouquet of flowers to you because i wanted to surprise you although i have high fever at that time somehow unexpected drama happens in the office and i had to cancel the surprise plan for you i was really disappointed and devastated i cried
3644594 we want to make this quiet achiever into a regionally significant showcase
3644595 however we dont want to dilute the buddhist values this place holds
3644596 even those visitors who are not buddhist know they have come to a special place
3644597 weve had posts bent before but to get them done that bad is beyond vandalism because you wouldnt expect it to go that far
3644598 im just dismayed that someone could do damage to this extent
3644599 its not a simple five minute job to bend them all over like that
3644600 hopefully they will be replaced in a fortnights time after which well transfer them to oakes oval for the grand final

3644604 i dont want this year to be hampering me with injuries and stuff like that so that was the first thought that came into my head but i should be beyond that now
3644605 last year i missed all of training camp and came out and had a pretty good year
3644606 ive been dealing with adversity since ive been in the nfl
3644607 i give him some pointers and my opinion on the whole situation
3644608 we can relate to that definitely we have a good relationship my first year here he kind of has shown me the ropes sheldon brown too were all pretty tight
3644609 you dont know how many reps were going to get
3644610 im anxious to see us play a whole game i think the more time you have together the more comfortable and relaxed you are to play together
3644611 like ive said this is not the time to be talking about whos on the field and whos not on the field were getting ready to go into the season and if were going to go into the season and try to win and seriously be committed to doing it youre going to have to push your ego aside for a year
3644612 i love to compete when im watching film and i see my teammates out there competing and getting after it and making plays something just comes into me makes me want to get out there if my brothers are out there and im not out there its kind of frustrating but im back and feeling good
3644613 definitely i should have made that interception hands down nine times out of 10 i never miss that play but one play doesnt make a game we lost and life goes on you have to move forward
3644614 people can say whatever they want like i said one play doesnt make a game whoever said things im sure they had a couple messed up plays that had an effect on the game
3644615 growing up i always wanted to be an olympian and this is my third olympics
3644616 now to be the most decorated olympian of all time i just dont know what to say
3644617 he could have come here and been in three races and won three gold medals
3644618 but if he can do it he wants to do it hes amazing
3644619 four years ago i just wanted to race those guys
3644620 but i hate to lose and getting third in the 200m freestyle four years ago when i lose in circumstances like that it motivates me more to try to swim faster over the last four years that has made me a better swimmer
3644621 im sure hes been on his best behavior but hes been good
3644622 you put him in the middle of the lineup and he makes everybody better
3644623 not only manny but ex indian casey blake that gives them more balance in their lineup that gives them a better hitting team theyre tough but manny makes their lineup look completely different hes such a good hitter
3644624 once you get past ramirez youve still got james loney and russell martin and blake standing in there thats pretty good i had interest in blake he was in cleveland and i saw him when he was with the twins hes pretty good he can get big hits for you
3644625 they know that were coming back to redeem ourselves and im pretty sure that they watch us a lot
3644626 has been circled on my calendar for about two years now
3644627 were preparing ourselves every night were showcasing what weve been doing the last three years getting ready for this moment so we cant afford to go out and be lackadaisical
3644628 a lot of nhl players have come from that area and they just decided they would name the arena after a mother who has always been there
3644629 shes been going there for 80 years she always made sure her kids got there they even have a special seat for her in the building
3644630 she knows something is going on but she has no idea about the name
3644631 its going to be exciting for her and for us
3644632 i started playing there in 1958 it was the first indoor arena i ever played in
3644633 they had boards and no glass on the sides and the fans could reach over and make contact with the players
3644634 one time i was playing left wing and a guy came over and hit me pretty good and my mother reached over and grabbed his hair and said no one touches my boy
3644635 the guy was shocked i was shocked shocked and embarrassed
3644636 thats my mother shes a pretty rabid fan and to this day she lives and dies with the flyers
3644637 mother still goes there and watches the senior league games
3644638 usually a good talker who liked to complain about social injustice but not too much
3644639 those oracle and sap are the two big software opportunities that we can work on
3644640 oracles supported distributions are novells sles red hats rhel asianux and oracle enterprise linux these decisions are based on customer demand and oracles focus on enterprise linux usage
3644641 we have a tradition that in times of crisis the opposition stands united behind the president and does not attack him
3644642 but georgia should not have advanced into tskhinvali south ossetias capital in so unprepared a way that was a grave error
3644643 the new cold war has long since been instigated by the usa through the americans so called missile defense shield in the czech republic and poland
3644644 hes led this team to a super bowl went to the nfc championship a couple times so he definitely knows what hes doing and hes put a good program together
3644645 we feel like weve got a few guys who can get it done
3644646 we brought booker in we brought jamal jones in whos another good kick returner there of course weve got j r reed and weve got buck correll buckhalter desean is going to get some kick returns at some point
3644647 thats important having all five guys playing together with many reps because its critical that they play well together as a unit
3644648 im very proud to be an olympian now officially but were kind of putting that part of it behind us were here to get on the podium were here to win and to give our best performance were not happy with just being here
3644649 we face all of these teams that were going to play here we can play at that level we know we belong at this level and we want to perform a 1 1 draw is a point but we are disappointed we didnt put our best performance out there
3644650 we start at a younger age in that area its a little more well known when kids are growing up as opposed to soccer in other areas
3644651 were making leaps and bounds as far as our skill level goes
3644652 these young kids are the ones who are holding the standard for the group theyre kind of pushing us older kids
3644653 to have us back in the games as a female sport is phenomenal
3644654 thats something were proud of to have our young futures kids able to watch us on tv and see us in the media and be able to have those aspirations we did as kids watching the mary lou rettons of the world
3644655 i think its very simple weve been devastated by injuries
3644656 no team ive ever seen in baseball has been decimated like this it would kill any team
3644657 imagine the red sox without josh beckett and jon lester chien ming wang won 19 games two straight years joba chamberlain became the most dominating pitcher in baseball you cant lose two guys like that
3644658 theyre trying hard to win theres only so much you can do theyre not supermen
3644659 its been like a fast a super fast ride in a car
3644660 for me personally i usually get excited way too quick and then if i have a letdown i usually get pretty angry about it
3644661 he only did one event but boy did he knock it out of the park
3644662 as long as i live im always going to know that i was on the olympic team with these guys that i won a bronze medal with these guys its in the record book
3644663 hes blocking me we went to the ground its football it happens off the field were friends on the field its a competition
3644664 i am extremely surprised because of the fact that i know the injury he had
3644665 sometimes you see him out there he looks like he is walking at 90 percent and all of a sudden hes in the game and playing at 100 percent great for j r
3644666 i kind of invented a brace it took me two years to get used to it but now i just play football i was determined to play it came down to hard work and believing in yourself when no one else did
3644667 eventually when im done playing im going to patent it
3644668 i finally landed back here which is a good place but its been a roller coaster
3644669 i made some mental errors here and there but everybody does you try to improve from there i want to start i know weve got a whole bunch of safeties but i want to start sometime i started three last year never know what could happen
3644670 i feel comfortable here its a very complicated defense but thats what i like about it youve got to be able to think a little bit you have to have smart safeties i think i can still play in this game
3644671 dunn is 20 walks from hitting 100 for the fifth straight year and only bonds has done 40 100 five in a row never babe ruth never ted williams no one but bonds and soon dunn
3644672 we set our price where we think it was fair
3644673 hes continued to hustle and hes played really well in right field
3644674 hes just in a little bit of a slump probably trying to do too much
3644675 coming back to philadelphia and working with bill bradshaw and his athletic support staff is what attracted me to temple university
3644676 after i came out a lot of guys were really positive about how i played which feels good
3644677 unfortunately that bony piece is attached to the ligament and the tendon
3644678 you never want to say you cant but i would say that its highly unlikely that youre going to see tom gordon pitch this year for us
3644679 he definitely was one of the big parts of our bullpen and keeping him was something we definitely needed to do because he can go from the seventh or eighth and definitely close the game for you
3644680 were going to miss flash but somebody has to step up and do his job i know weve got the people down there to do that
3644681 i felt real good with what i did warming up i got up to where i normally would be and felt great so that gives me a good indication that im good
3644682 what can you say the last three starts have been great then you come into this one and i have the best stuff out of all those starts and get shoved what can you do
3644683 she blossomed as a race horse just when hard spun retired
3644684 popping up faster than the fuzz on a teenagers upper lip
3644685 beer is a very very integral part of the world championships its the only proven performance enhancing substance we know of
3644686 there were a lot of things i was doing wrong
3644687 we know what we have to do its a matter of executing those things we have been doing good defense and pitching
3644688 our goal always is to get to the world series
3644689 to come here and lose in the first round like this it aint right man it dont seem real to me
3644690 every day every week every month even years that ive been working so hard for this and i came this far to lose in the first round again im not saying i failed myself but it should be the right scoring the scoring should be fair to everybody
3644691 for him to lose it could be disheartening for some of our other guys
3644692 thats going to be our biggest fear i think theyre most definitely going to be psyched out we have a psychologist around and were going to make sure she talks to the team im sure all of them are going to be psyched out
3644693 i didnt really know the score because it was so much going on in the crowd everybody was yelling and screaming
3644694 i was looking at some of my teammates and it sounded like they were saying move and some were just saying fight i thought i was up i thought i was up because i was scoring evidently i was down
3644695 raushee hit him he got a point twice and twice raushee threw punches and scored he also got points that determined the outcome of the fight
3644696 weve been saying youre missing a great opportunity to get more of your people in here to celebrate your games
3644697 i would want to stress how important it is for the host city that the venues are seen to be full and everybody has the opportunity to enjoy the festivities
3644698 about two days ago i got pretty upset because since ive been here theyve tested me four times and they took blood a lot of blood
3644699 they are taking so much blood i am going to be very weak before the final of the 100 meters
3644700 continue to explore all available options in order to add an additional big man to our roster
3644701 mastering the hype cycle how to adopt the right innovation at the right time
3644702 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3644703 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3644704 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3644705 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3644706 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3644707 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3644708 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3644709 new services and trials are being announced almost every day judging from the response from users so far to services like m pesa and smartmoney prospects for these services are excellent both in developing and developed countries for many people it has been costly and difficult for them to transfer money via existing services even to friends and family using mobile phones solves the problem
3644710 we thank roelof for his service as a director of the company since 2004 we also thank him for his service as a member of the audit and compensation committees
3644711 circumvent or otherwise attack the security of the fare media system
3644712 concerned with the core issue of immediate concern in this case the security and integrity of its fare media system
3644713 the tro as initially granted restricted the students from providing true publicly known legally acquired information about the mbtas charliecards and charlietickets in violation of the first amendment
3644714 the current tro as the mbta suggests that it be modified still restricts the students from providing true legally acquired information about these cards this restriction also violates the first amendment
3644715 we decline to discuss our ongoing communications with counsel for the mbta our priority at this point is to ensure that the temporary restraining order is lifted
3644716 continues to hang over our clients heads making them uncertain what if anything they can say about their research and this case
3644717 keep fighting in court over abstract issues while life goes by
3644718 i am very happy to see that we are consolidating our strong relationships within the us the nci relationship opens up for us new and exciting opportunities within the field of cancer and we are proud to join forces with one of the most prestigious and well established cancer research organisations in the world in the collaboration with nci bavarian nordic benefits from the enormous expertise in cancer therapeutics development that is present in the nci organisation this will truly strengthen cancer as a strategic focus area in years to come in line with our outlined strategy
3644719 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3644720 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3644721 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3644722 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3644723 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3644724 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3644725 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3644726 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3644727 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3644728 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3644729 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3644730 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3644731 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3644732 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3644733 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3644734 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3644735 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3644736 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3644737 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3644738 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3644739 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3644740 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3644741 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3644742 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3644743 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3644744 when cassini makes its closest approach 50 km during the flyby of the moon
3644745 the porcupine with the sharpest quills gets stuck on a tree more often
3644746 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3644747 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3644748 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3644749 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3644750 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3644751 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3644752 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3644753 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3644754 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3644755 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3644756 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3644757 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3644758 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3644759 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3644760 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3644761 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3644762 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3644763 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3644764 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3644765 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3644766 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3644767 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3644768 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3644769 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3644770 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3644771 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3644772 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3644773 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3644774 the fyrom premiers letter surpasses the limits of diplomacy and borders on nationalistic hysteria which is bad for his people
3644775 if there was a distinction in greece between the church and the state
3644776 we do not feel very pleased when thousands of confused tourists ask why our neighbor is using our countrys name for its airport in thessaloniki
3644777 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3644778 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3644779 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3644780 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3644781 i think its a reasonable expectation that they will cave again and if they dont were more ready to go to the polls than they are
3644782 have pushed the country to the brink of a recession
3644783 its no wonder they are playing tarzan with their juvenile taunts
3644784 if were going to compete internationally for the best and for the brightest we need to improve the way that we attract and retain those who want to work in their fields and contribute to canadian society
3644785 theyre good enough to work here but we dont want them to become canadian citizens
3644786 thats 90 per cent of the 165 000 temporary foreign workers who are working in canada right now
3644787 with nearly full employment an aging population and skill shortages there is an immediate need to ensure canadian employers can access the skills they need
3644788 overt discouragement of attendance of a witness whos been summoned would constitute basis for contempt
3644789 would be a matter which should be or could be subject to its own investigation
3644790 she said it but shes from the party she would contact whoever the executive director is
3644791 if thats part of a pattern then its some attempt to steer if not to interfere with the witnesses i resent it
3644792 mr lowry is a standup guy hes telling the truth i think theyre digging themselves into a deep deep hole everything the conservatives are doing has the stink of desperation all over it
3644793 what they are saying is that ignoring russias interests is going to come at a price and theyve said it in a pretty brutal way
3644794 having recovered economically and to a degree politically and militarily they are in a position to say enough is enough
3644795 talking to ordinary russians there is a real sense of national humiliation
3644796 their sense of self worth was dramatically undermined by the soviet collapse their sense of being part of a major power was stripped away
3644797 as a turning point no less significant than nov 9 1989 when the berlin wall fell
3644798 the kremlins message is crystal clear dont tread on me
3644799 mollifying them only strengthens the extremists because they can say look we faced down the west and won

3644801 there are very very skilled professionals in the city who have not been given access in advance to inspect these things
3644802 facilities that require enhanced fire protection should be inspected by the fire department
3644803 those oracle and sap are the two big software opportunities that we can work on
3644804 oracles supported distributions are novells sles red hats rhel asianux and oracle enterprise linux these decisions are based on customer demand and oracles focus on enterprise linux usage
3644805 the workers on the boat were used as guinea pigs
3644806 how can this happen why cant they put mannequins and cameras on the boat to see what happens during a free fall
3644807 the remains of around 10 people appeared on the surface as we removed the first layer of soil and at least several dozen remains
3644808 it is the 10th so called secondary grave found in kamenica
3644809 i have no knowledge when she will come it is not possible for foreign minister of a country to keep track of the movement of the individual who is our guest it is for them to decide
3644810 this much you know that our tradition is to give shelter to anybody who seeks shelter
3644811 punjabi music has been the soul of singh is kingg mehndi told
3644812 not just singh is kingg most of the bollywood hits flicks and indian rap singers are depending on punjabi music to ensure a popular song
3644813 that is simply not the way international relations can be run in the 21st century
3644814 the situation is exceptionally bad we do not expect miracles spectacular progress cannot be made from one day to the next
3644815 clark gregg knew that id written choke while listening to pablo honey with creep over and over and over so clark got radiohead to contribute a song to write a song for the very end of the movie the final credits apparently radiohead liked the movie so much theyve written the score most of the ambient music throughout it
3644816 every olympian is extraordinary every olympic winner is super extraordinary but he is superman
3644817 he has been doing great so far he is looking positive looking like he can deliver
3644818 so more strength to him and i hope he has the strength to finish
3644819 you just see a look of determination that as an athlete you know hes on a mission
3644820 i feel like now when hes in that pool he is focused and he is ready to get after it and i think hes going to do it
3644821 parliament should no longer make a shield around those legislators who are being investigated by the justice system
3644822 the islands road network is of a third world standard
3644823 our so called national road network is narrow dangerous poorly lit and badly maintained
3644824 the east west energy corridor and turkey being an energy hub for the west is one of the principal arguments of turkey in its application for the eu and the need to have a good relationship with turkey
3644825 this conflict casts a shadow over turkeys foreign policy platform of creating an area of stability
3644826 this conflict could strengthen the argument for the west that if turkey is outside the tent it could create a lot of difficulties for the eu
3644827 so from the eu point of view it would make sense to bring turkey into the tent
3644828 there is also a concern that if turkey is part of the eu you are bringing the eus border to georgia and to the rest of the caucasus which might not go well in continental europe
3644829 we want stability in the region and to see fighting stop as soon as possible there is fire in the neighbors house
3644830 turkey doesnt want this war but it has had a difficult job adjusting its foreign policy toward russia and georgia
3644831 a reclusive millionaire was battered to death in his birthday drunk stabbed to death by neighbour who mistook him for burglar after he went to wrong house
3644832 why not give the military a chance to see if they can finish the job
3644833 i think people are feeling keenly that the economy is starting to slow down and things are getting more difficult
3644834 young people are sympathizing because they see themselves and todays situation in the novel
3644835 the sympathy is sporadic and i dont think it will lead to organized movements
3644836 things are different now from the stable employment conditions of japans period of high economic growth
3644837 life time employment is gone and its uncertain whether people will receive their pensions i think such insecurity attracts people to this text
3644838 the novels like a dream everyone uniting fighting and winning together
3644839 but i doubt well see that type of reaction now
3644840 is this even possible and if so why the h would you want someone else using your credit
3644841 some web sites advertise and price high quality credit card trade lines on the basis of their credit limits and time on the account a site called addatradeline com recently offered a card history with a 25 000 credit limit and 2 3 4 years of perfect payments for a fee of 1 025

3644844 it is also perhaps incumbent on the milf that a member of theirs has committed a criminal act to make him own up to it it also reflects on their credibility as an organization
3644845 if they milf insist that he is a legitimate commander and a legitimate commander does a criminal act in the armed forces that is submitted to court martial
3644846 maybe he couldnt reach that zipper in the back or something
3644847 i dispute that its a problem its a crisis but its not a humanitarian crisis
3644848 the refugees are afraid to return to their homes the fighting is still fresh i their minds
3644849 the areas have been cleared of troops under ameril umbra kato only the milf who are native to the area were left
3644850 by the looks of it they cannot withstand the pressure they cant withstand the beating theyre black and blue theyre escaping
3644851 it was the militia that started the fighting not the milf
3644852 addressing the concerns of the displaced remains our top priority
3644853 we need food we need clean water we cant bear the hardship of being evicted from our homes we need to live normal lives again
3644854 me my wife and four young children stay there waiting for food assistance but we cannot be in this situation for long
3644855 it was so cold at night and so hot at daytime this is how miserable our life has become because of the fighting
3644856 there is no way we can give up on the peace process
3644857 fire eagle is about making everything on the internet more useful fun or interesting by adding the element of location

3644859 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3644860 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3644861 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3644862 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3644863 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3644864 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3644865 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3644866 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3644867 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3644868 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3644869 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3644870 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3644871 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3644872 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3644873 thats a substantial business it gives iphone a justifiable claim to being a viable gaming platform
3644874 sans la pluie de dimanche je naurais pas eu cette sciatique et sans cette sciatique ce qui est s r cest que je n tais pas 100 finir quatri me dans ces conditions ce nest pas mal
3644875 this shows you we were going in the right direction and thats right when they pulled the rug from under us
3644876 the decision to close any school is based first and foremost on the schools performance
3644877 thats one of the issues when you base accountability systems on their progress
3644878 the way to solve the problem of scarce parking isnt by doling out perks that just benefit the privileged few
3644879 we need smart policies that benefit everyone you dont solve the problem by giving three people free parking and exacerbating the problem for everybody else
3644880 our district stretches from park slope we are out in the field a lot
3644881 we should be setting an example and not getting special privileges
3644882 other new yorkers including those with special needs are routinely denied special consideration to get such a parking spot
3644883 i should have to endure what everybody else does in the city in terms of parking
3644884 id rather have the permit go to a police officer than me
3644885 this is about when it is right for the government to take peoples property
3644886 this speaks to the rights of americans to hold property in america
3644887 before this project proceeds to a doomed fate in the city council we strongly urge the administration to come to the table and work with us
3644888 in terms of the number of students who are ready this year compared to last we are talking about genuine progress
3644889 more students are reaching at least a minimum level of readiness for college credit courses were keeping a lot of kids from having to take remedial level courses that translates to millions of dollars that are being saved at the state level
3644890 we have a more heterogeneous population of test takers so were including those kids who werent considering college or arent considering college
3644891 the philosophy was in these large natural areas fire should be allowed to play its role
3644892 what happened in 88 in yellowstone was probably a passing of the threshold with what the political and social world was comfortable with it was perceived that we were burning up their national park and there would be nothing left of it
3644893 every single day you couldnt believe that youd wake up and there was more fire new fires started
3644894 because people didnt understand it we didnt do a good enough job explaining it back then it became known as the let it burn policy
3644895 we learned a lot in 1988 about how much fire a park could take before they ran out of resources
3644896 i think the overriding message of our report was as big as these fires were and as important as they were in many ways they were not historically unprecedented and it was not unnatural
3644897 we very emphatically said and i think the 20 years since then have confirmed that the fires were not an ecological disaster
3644898 actually its a lot greener now hopefully we learned from that its ok to let nature do what it needs to do clean house
3644899 now if somebody wants to sue us they have an option to sue but im fairly certain that a judge will see it the way the way the citizens see it here
3644900 the citizens deserve peace that some infringement on constitutional rights is ok and we have not violated anything as far as the constitution
3644901 weve had people call us expressing concern for their children
3644902 they had to sleep on the floor because of stray bullets
3644903 the residents of these high crime areas are already victims
3644904 theyre victims of what are happening in the neighborhoods theyre victims of fear but for them to be subject to unlawful stops and questioning that is not going to ultimately going to help this situation
3644905 as far as im concerned at 3 oclock in the morning nobody has any business being on the street except the law
3644906 anyone out at 3 oclock shouldnt be out on the street unless youre going to the hospital
3644907 were no longer using teamcity we have replaced it with binary dependency build which allows to check out only the module a developer wish to work on and hell automatically get the latest fresh binary dependencies built by our ci tool
3644908 is my change going to affect any user or any plugin developer in any way
3644909 ashley was a much loved son who will be sadly missed by all his family

3644911 in my opinion the choice could not be more clear between one candidate john mccain whos had experience been tested in war and tried in peace another candidate who has not between one candidate john mccain who has always put the country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate who has not between one candidate whos a talker and the other candidate whos the leader america needs as our next president
3644912 ashley was a much loved son who will be sadly missed by all his family
3644913 this is just another way hes making history and we want to be part of it
3644914 i was so nervous i dont know if i saw it really well but i think its a good likeness
3644915 they showed them yesterday and i looked at them online i was planning to buy them but never dreamed we would do this
3644916 presley place where the money will go we contribute to them every year
3644917 also i want that on display in my living room in a curio cabinet
3644918 there is no more powerful demonstration of a fathers love than this
3644919 dad will you take part in a marathon with me
3644920 the money is being spent to improve the overall operations of the school and for the future of the school and it is being spent appropriately
3644921 ultimately we would like to see and im sure renaissance would like to see that money go into their program
3644922 but if theyre shut down they wont have a program for it to go into
3644923 this is costing people a lot of time money and heartache
3644924 its our responsibility to gather all the information thats available to us to determine whether our initial decision to not to renew should be sustained
3644925 thats really our responsibility im looking at this from our position as the school reform commission
3644926 when youre placed in a situation by the school district where you are under attack and your charter is not being renewed based on what we think is faulty data you have no choice but to defend the school
3644927 they need to defend themselves against some of the accusations that have been made
3644928 if you look at some of the studies renaissances academics are as good if not better than some charter schools that were renewed without question
3644929 the renaissance charter is not looking for this whole issue to go away
3644930 they understand they need corrective action and they are taking steps towards that

3644935 by establishing a learning environment i e a network of people artefacts and tools consciously or unconsciously involved in learning activities is part of the learning outcomes not an instructional condition
3644936 they share one characteristic they deal primarily with the navigation through content i e the represented domain specific knowledge information processing and knowledge construction activities are not in the focus of these approaches consequently they do not treat environments as learning outcomes and they cannot support learning environment design
3644937 considering the learning environment not only a condition for but also an outcome of learning moves the learning environment further away from being a monolithic platform which is personalisable or customisable by learners easy to use and heading towards providing an open set of learning tools an unrestricted number of actors and an open corpus of artefacts either pre existing or created by the learning process freely combinable and utilisable by learners within their learning activities easy to develop
3644938 in this section we describe the development of a technological framework enabling learners to build up their own personal learning environments by composing web based tools into a single user experience get involved in collaborative activities share their designs with peers for best practice or best of breed emergence and adapt their designs to reflect their experience of the learning process this framework is meant to be a generic platform for end user development of personal learning environments taking into account the paradigm shift from expert driven personalisation of learning to a design for emergence method for building a personal learning environment

3644960 our desire is to ensure that every stakeholder is content with arrangements and is comfortable with the icc champions trophy taking place in pakistan
3644961 we are committed to a safe and secure event in pakistan
3644962 to that end it was agreed that representatives who have attended the latest briefings and demonstrations in lahore and karachi will visit stakeholders who have expressed reservations to let them know of the safety and security measures on the ground
3644963 the results of those meetings will then be fed back to me and also to the icc vice president sharad pawar and icc chief executive haroon lorgat on 20 august so we can make a further assessment of the comfort levels of our participating members
3644964 we are committed to a safe and secure event in pakistan we believe these visits and the feedback we get from them will play a major role in us achieving those ends
3644965 during the recently completed asia cup there were no fixtures at rawalpindi and that didnt allow us the opportunity to check the security arrangements so there has been no way for us to formulate an opinion on the venue
3644966 we believe that by excluding rawalpindi and using just two venues both of them successful hosts during the asia cup it will remove doubt allow a further concentration of resources and thus improve comfort levels for all stakeholders in the event

3644995 what the hell is going on doc is this some kind of sick joke you play on people for kicks where the hell is my baby
3644996 i i i i dont know ive never seen anything like it before its impossible something like that cant happen i can only surmise that your wife had it implanted
3644997 what how dare you first you pull this then you accuse my wife of carrying an implanted car for nine sodding months who the hell do you think you are
3644998 im s sorry sir but there isnt any other possibility this cant happen its medically scientifically impossible for this to happen naturally to do so it would have to be some kind of miracle
3644999 well this is unheard of if the item was implanted especially for nine months then all sorts of internal injury could have occurred id like to keep your wife in so we can run some tests find out the extent of the damage determine when it happened we should probably keep the it in as well for cross examination purposes
3645000 okay fine i just want this to be over first though i want to talk about it with my wife excuse me
3645001 honey the doctors want to keep you and the baby in for some tests as you might imagine they are a little shocked by whats happened
3645002 will you stay with me i dont want us to be apart not now the babies here he needs his father as much as he needs me
3645003 ill try sarah honey i know youre feeling pretty emotional right now but is there something youre not telling me about the baby
3645004 its because hes different isnt it harold hes your son no theres nothing to say other than i love him and if you only give him a chance youll feel the same way
3645005 okay okay im sorry its just so strange its not what i expected at all i mean the doctors they say things like this dont happen ever
3645006 then hes our own little miracle ive changed my mind i dont want any tests i want to go home harold me and and baby i want to go home
3645007 this could be the trigger that helps move prospective first time buyers off the fence and back into the market but it wont last forever
3645008 remodelers are experiencing slower activity in markets nationwide particularly for major improvements to owner occupied housing
3645009 while markets remain pretty active most remodelers are taking on a greater number of smaller jobs to maintain their businesses
3645010 as in previous economic downturns remodeling activity is proving to be cyclical rather than countercyclical although the degree of decline pales in comparison to the setbacks registered in the new home market said nahb chief economist david seiders
3645011 we expect remodeling to remain generally flat in 2009 followed by strong growth due to home maintenance needs
3645012 as our third quarter results illustrate difficult operating conditions in the homebuilding industry persist
3645013 despite lower home prices relatively low interest rates and a large choice of available homes potential homebuyers remain reluctant due to eroding consumer confidence amid concerns about employment growth higher energy costs and the overall economy based on these demand dynamics coupled with high supply levels of new and existing home inventory we believe industry conditions will remain challenging for the remainder of this fiscal year and as we enter fiscal 2009
3645014 with the addition of solar in a home were no longer just efficient users of electricity we become producers integrating a solar system into a home during construction is less expensive than adding it later making solar more accessible and affordable than its ever been
3645015 trilogy homes pass the true test of a green home by integrating a mix of energy saving and energy generating devices that deliver immediate and long term benefits for our customer
3645016 were proud to be trilogys exclusive solar provider as they become the first national residential builder to introduce solar across all of their communities
3645017 we are pleased to see that home builders around the country increasingly see the value that solar brings to their homes as well as to their homebuyers
3645018 we generated net income in the second quarter that was the best in our companys history we are very pleased to have achieved strong top and bottom line growth for the quarter and to have extended our positive momentum through the first half of 2008 we continued to experience increasing customer demand for our products and high acceptance for our appealing value proposition in addition improvements we have made in our merchandise assortment in stock positions and inventory allocation are reflected in our results overall our performance to date this year reflects the increased discipline we have brought to our business as well as our entire teams ability to execute our business plan importantly we are continuing to benefit from our recent operational improvements which provide us with a solid foundation for long term growth
3645019 we are encouraged by our strong performance in the first six months of 2008 especially given the challenging environment and we are optimistic about our prospects for the second half of the year our new stores continue to perform ahead of our expectations and remain a significant contributor to our results in addition our stronger infrastructure is enabling us to create additional efficiencies while positioning our business for long term effectiveness we remain confident in our ability to execute our growth strategy focused on extending our footprint growing sales and driving sustained operating margin expansion
3645020 the decision to sell welcome wagon was not made lightly
3645021 however we know that we have to not only be willing but decisive about shifting or eliminating resources if they cannot contribute to the overall growth of the business the same is true of our planned expense reductions
3645022 the issues and challenges facing the residential real estate market are creating a permanent dislocation in the offline real estate advertising market with online spending benefiting in the long run
3645023 as the market recovers the needs of consumers and advertisers will be quite different than they are today we have a clear strategy to meet those needs and are adjusting our business to focus on assets and new development initiatives that are essential to our long term strategy while eliminating unprofitable revenue streams and improving cash flow to invest in growth our success has been and will continue to be driven by our clear market leadership as consumers have shown through their actions that move is the most trusted source in online real estate
3645024 with overall satisfaction remaining stable since 2007 it is apparent that window and patio door manufacturers are continuing to doing a good job of pleasing their customers which is no small feat in these tight economic times
3645025 in this highly competitive industry those manufacturers that provide products with superior quality including a particularly low incidence of problems and that also communicate the value of their products and services to the consumer will be in the best position to differentiate themselves from the competition
3645026 given that proper installation is critical to good window performance it may seem counterintuitive that customer satisfaction with self installed windows is commensurate to that of customers with windows installed by a contractor or handyman but study data shows that this is indeed the case
3645027 for those consumers who are considering performing installation themselves they should make sure they are comfortable with the particulars of the project including the exterior siding material of the home scope of the job including the number and sizes of windows required whether windows will be retro fitted or replaced local code requirements whether any special tools are required and their personal skill level consumers may wish to turn to manufacturer web sites for help since they often provide detailed product installation information

3645121 i dont think united have another level to go to they had a lot of players who have been at the peak of their form for the last two years
3645122 rio ferdinand has been awesome for the last two years and cristiano ronaldo was unbelievable i dont think youll see that again
3645123 wayne rooney carlos tevez ryan giggs they have all been fantastic
3645124 i think we can close the gap because man utd were at the very top of their game last season but weve been very close to them and we had injuries and a change of manager
3645125 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand
3645126 and if they think also that somehow its all going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
3645127 if they think this is the way to go we will end up with millions of small farmers all over the world being driven off their land into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness then you count me out i think it will be an absolute disaster

3645130 andrew is absolutely thrilled with his debut album but it is a huge personal blow to him that prince has declined the use of purple rain
3645131 it is disappointing that the track that got him signed and was loved by the record company could jeopardise the album release so it had to be removed
3645132 i have the utmost respect for prince without purple rain i wouldnt be where i am today
3645133 yes i think they could be the best partnership in the competition these two are top class it would be better if they had played together for a long time but theyre both clever players and they will have an even better understanding over time
3645134 i think they will be okay and can show their quality in the time they have had together they have played well and we have been scoring goals they need time but we have confidence in them and i think we played well in the last game against lazio
3645135 this pre season was a bit different because we had players like torres coming back late after euro 2008 and then we signed keane too
3645136 its not an ideal situation at this stage but hopefully it will be enough the very least we will be looking for is an away goal
3645137 i have confidence in my players but you must always be careful of any team you come up against in europe i know liege lost to st etienne in a friendly but they also won the belgian super cup the other day so we need to be careful
3645138 we have been trying to learn a lot about liege and have been watching the games they have been playing recently and of course analysing last season too
3645139 any top side competing in this competition must be aware of the quality of the teams involved we must be focused every game and make sure we do not make any mistakes we know its important to qualify every year and hopefully it will be the same this year

3645179 our strong increases in same store occupancy rate revpar and ebitda margin for the quarter on a year over year basis is very encouraging and positions holloway nicely for the remainder of 2008
3645180 during the second quarter and through the first half of 2008 we met our volume expectations and were generally pleased with the gains made in most segments of our business with net growth from new and existing customers in all segments except our toll business expected to continue we foresee our annual volumes to increase over 2007
3645181 we launched a multi media advertising campaign during the second quarter this marketing program clearly communicates the advantages of the swiss water process and highlights our ability to provide consumers with decaffeinated coffee that has not been exposed to chemical solvents such as methylene chloride or ethyl acetate the chemicals used in approximately 80 of decaffeinated coffee now available to consumers worldwide we expect this important investment to grow our business over the balance of this year and into next
3645182 our strong second quarter results provide further validation that our strategy to diversify our operations expand our wholesale activities internationally and prudently invest in network infrastructure is working
3645183 since the start of the year we have improved the key performance metrics of our wholesale and retail divisions including sales gross margins net income account receivables customer wins and call volumes we expect this steady growth to continue for the balance of 2008 based on the increasing demand for our telecommunications services particularly within emerging markets in asia africa and south america we expect this trend to continue in q3 as we have just completed our most profitable month ever in july

3645254 mts continued to deliver profitable growth during the second quarter

3645295 australia does the needles and the us does the sexuality men who have sex with men and sex workers
3645296 its very short sighted there are major deficiencies in what the us does or rather what it doesnt allow its funds to do
3645297 its disappointing because australia has great expertise in prevention among gay men with its aids councils and the gay educators
3645298 its an irony that weve got these epidemics at a point in which they could still be stopped or avoided in the asian cities among men who have sex with men but were not making much use if at all of australian expertise

3645302 the city is proud to support each and every one of these successful grants and we are particularly pleased to support so many worthwhile initiatives from our glbt community
3645303 these two grants will help us provide valuable opportunities for members of our community to increase the knowledge skills and networks that can help improve their health and welfare we thank the city of sydney for their support and look forward to working with them on these projects as well as the many other initiatives that form part of acons partnership with the city of sydney
3645304 we are thrilled to have been awarded this considerable opportunity to extend our community education work we wish to sincerely thank the city of sydney who have been a long time supporter of the glrl through subsidised rent and support for our 58 08 campaign
3645305 previously i was unaware that you could receive funding for more than one event at a time so were currently looking at maybe getting another grant to set up other things like perhaps a self defence class which would be great from my experience the council has been nothing but helpful and as a community organisation we really are appreciative of the help they provide

3645314 circumcision has been proven in reducing the risk of heterosexual men becoming infected from an hiv positive woman from vaginal sex but our main finding is that circumcised or not gay men are just as likely to use condoms
3645315 gay men are concerned about sexual dysfunction premature ejaculation as well as old arguments that circumcision reduced masturbation or sexual desire
3645316 in our study we found gay men who were circumcised at infancy didnt report having some kind of negative or positive impact on sexual dysfunction
3645317 however nearly all men who were circumcised after infancy reported some sexual dysfunction erectile problems or premature ejaculation and one in five reported some complication as a result of the circumcision particularly they were twice as likely to be bottoms
3645318 if male circumcision does take place our study confirms that infant circumcision is much safer
3645319 theyre coming from a generation where circumcision is really down but also given the interesting findings from africa we need to know whether they are thinking about circumcision and whether they want to forgo condom use
3645320 pilates is especially advocated because it is easy on the joints however what is not understood is that three fourths of classical pilates mat exercises that you would encounter at the typical pilates mat class is that they involve these dangerous movements of forward bending

3645325 the problem of obesity needs to be tackled by strong action from the government
3645326 there are many products which contain such high levels of fat and other ingredients that they are contributing to health problems
3645327 rather than banning foods it would be a system of food labelling and working with the food industry to phase these products out
3645328 removing unhealthy foods from sale would be in the interests of industry as well
3645329 after all consumers cant keep buying their products if they are unwell or even dead
3645330 it could break down and become unaffordable at that point either that or the system could become completely clogged up
3645331 we have dealt with all the critical elements on which president mugabe and mutambara agree but theres disagreement with one element over which morgan tsvangirai has asked for more time to reflect
3645332 the u s is a country that needs to stand by a loyal ally
3645333 on the other hand it cannot risk military engagement because the stakes would be too high of a confrontation with russia
3645334 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3645335 the georgians have agreed to a cease fire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3645336 the idea is to show the russians that it is no longer business as usual
3645337 we have been hearing from russia we dont want to stay
3645338 they believe that they have made some progress and we welcome that and we certainly welcome the eu mediation
3645339 the number one reason was because we believe he can help our hockey club and we felt strongly that we missed him last year

3645343 puede pasar en agosto se triplican los vuelos y por tanto tambi n los retrasos
3645344 though ultimately the funniest part being the requirements for both functions
3645345 since i graduated ive run all kind of errands to sustain myself still i havent found a stable job
3645346 we completed class x and two years of vocational training but when we approach employers were treated like any other job seekers
3645347 there are foreign labourers who perform better for less money
3645348 during our development planning we never thought wed require to train our people in technical fields
3645349 as a result weve as many as 37 000 foreign workers in the country today
3645350 this addressed to an extent the experience issue which most construction companies demand
3645351 where do the specific responsibilities of the government begin and end
3645352 dead flies on table smell of rotten meat and poor cleanliness
3645353 the first guide was incompetent the second did not know proper english
3645354 the main complaints against hotels were on poor hygiene plumbing hot water supply food mattresses showers in bathroom and bathroom facilities
3645355 the emerging problem is that there is more focus by new players on quantity rather than quality which can drive down a destination market
3645356 we need to develop more of nature attraction and adventure sports facilities so that more of them come back
3645357 we wouldnt be able to go and watch them as the train station will not sell us any train tickets so i dont really care
3645358 the slogan is now about a safe olympics and of course in the chinese way of doing things they impose more restrictions
3645359 and even if they are just buddist monks religious forces are always regarded by the chinese government as one of the political threats to the regime
3645360 they always come to ask us where have you been and who have you talked to
3645361 i remember coming here and it was all about alternative lifestyles
3645362 i think they could be as good as it gets in the champions league
3645363 they are both in the top class level and can be as good as anyone if they play together more games then they can get better and better
3645364 i would prefer them to have played together more but we couldnt with both torres and keane coming in late it wasnt the ideal situation but i think it could be enough
3645365 but both torres and keane are prepared enough to play well
3645366 josep guardiola has explained in the press conference for the game against wisla krakow that samuel etoo will continue one more season as an azulgrana barca player
3645367 we were prepared and have 12 tanks at gedu since august 9 waiting for the roads to clear
3645368 were only issuing fuel worth nu 500 and while some customers argue some understand our problem
3645369 i dont fuel my car at night because it gets stolen and today there happens to be a fuel shortage
3645370 i didnt expect this to happen the authorities should be more prepared since its monsoon time
3645371 we issued 90 000 litres of petrol and diesel to all fuel stations in thimphu
3645372 people need not panic despite the roadblocks weve enough at the dechencholing outlet to sustain for more than a month and well ensure that there will be regular supply
3645373 we warn muslims to be wary of all forms of unbeliever democracy because they are just a ploy by the zionist crusader alliance to trick you
3645374 a counter insurgency takes a long time longer than we thought
3645375 at first i felt a bit uneasy about letting them go now im just indifferent
3645376 al qaeda is not able to plot attacks in countries other than algeria
3645377 there certainly is a level of isi complicity in the militant areas in pakistan and organisations such as the taliban
3645378 i am sad my dream of buying a maruti 800 is shattered
3645379 if this proposal goes through basic transportation like cars will only be for the rich
3645380 im staying in jungshina now how can people like us staying outside thimphu travel if we dont get to buy cars
3645381 now that the rich and lucky have their cars people like us have to probably buy second hand vehicles from them
3645382 the idea of taxing vehicles was discussed in the cabinet in the context of preserving our foreign reserves
3645383 if everybody in bhutan buys a car then it will negatively affect our foreign reserves inflation fuel imports and the environment
3645384 a huge chunk of our import bill and rupees are spent on fuel
3645385 well only approve taxation thats in the interest of the nation or people
3645386 the plan will provide incentives to transport contractors to open transport routes in places without one
3645387 well also see if we can introduce tramlines in places like thimpu and paro
3645388 watching whats been happening in other places ive become increasingly aware of the publics frustration with elected officials who abuse authority
3645389 people in montgomery county should know that there is a place they can go if they believe someone is abusing public authority
3645390 creating a special unit and putting specialized prosecutors and agents on it raises the level in the publics mind and in the criminal justice system of these types of crimes
3645391 it goes to the heart of democracy people have to have faith in their elected officials that they abide by the law
3645392 its fundamentally a question about the integrity of the park at a place like valley forge the land is part of the historic character
3645393 you dont know how badly ive been looking for one of these
3645394 we shouldnt have mixed signals where you have river road and river avenue
3645395 i know ive had conversations with businesses and i dont blame their frustration
3645396 its got all the issues of a major city without the resources
3645397 what hopeworks is doing is wonderful but this is a nonprofit organization teaching young kids in camden digital technology and mapping technology for a major city facing complex problems you dont want to be dependent on that
3645398 they kept saying we really need to do something about it
3645399 his ministry is a gift the episcopal church so desperately needs
3645400 bishop bennison should not be permitted to resume his episcopate in the diocese of pennsylvania under any circumstances
3645401 his credibility and lack of appropriate pastoral sensitivity demonstrate he could not effectively lead the diocese
3645402 i trusted him to be my pastor and he abandoned me
3645403 john distorted and perverted my understanding of god but charles stole the church from me
3645404 the value of one soul outweighs the many good works of the bishop
3645405 should not be permitted to remain as a bishop in the episcopal church
3645406 keep all the people of the diocese of pennsylvania safe from harm
3645407 there are frankly not very many people who possess charles unique combination of intellectual personal pastoral and spiritual gifts
3645408 bishop bennisons misconduct reflected fundamental aspects of his character that render him unfit to serve as a member of the clergy
3645409 this ill conceived policy has resulted in crimes that attack the basic rights of the citizens of coatesville
3645410 the dark forces of lawlessness that fester within the blighted recesses of our city
3645411 everybody on section 8 is not into drugs or criminal activity
3645412 quite honestly its time for the city to take back what belongs to us our streets and our homes
3645413 there is a level of fear amongst the folks who live in the city and thats ridiculous
3645414 education is important in getting young people to understand their worth
3645415 mon espoir est que cet accord aidera les victimes et leurs familles gu rir et aller de lavant
3645416 je pr sente une nouvelle fois mes excuses aux victimes et leurs familles et toute la communaut catholique nous devons continuer faire tout ce qui est en notre pouvoir pour assurer la s curit des enfants sous notre garde
3645417 ce processus de m diation correspond aux meilleures pratiques et peut servir de mod le pour de futures m diations
3645418 in a lot of ways drug dealers are like roaches we squash one and then another comes in
3645419 he was very elusive we had trouble getting information about him
3645420 we heard him talking about settling the score with guns and muscles and what he was going to do to retaliate
3645421 oftentimes these robberies between drug dealers turn into murder we couldnt allow that to happen
3645422 popping up faster than the fuzz on a teenagers upper lip
3645423 beer is a very very integral part of the world championships its the only proven performance enhancing substance we know of
3645424 there were a lot of things i was doing wrong
3645425 this is such a perversion of what parents are supposed to be
3645426 daniel and andrea kelly have inverted the maxim in which a child kills his parents and throws himself on the mercy of the court claiming that he is an orphan
3645427 we try to expose these young people to as many positive experiences as possible anything that will help them succeed in college
3645428 we provide the opportunities but theyre the ones who have to put in the work
3645429 it was like immaculate thats one of my new words i like to use
3645430 these kids have excellent coping skills for the streets of chester unfortunately theyre not always transferable
3645431 the idea is not to be ashamed of you who are but to have options
3645432 she was obviously very bright and both her parents were working and living at home she defied all the stereotypes and yet her ignorance was appalling it was not her fault but a criminal failure of the system of education
3645433 not a lot of people from chester high graduate they fall out after 10th grade i can give hope for little kids be a role model i can change the world by being one person
3645434 before i wasnt even sure i wanted to go to college
3645435 but now i have a direction and feel prepared its also helped me realize my leadership potential how i can influence my peers
3645436 gentle little people about 3 to 4 feet tall wearing halloween masks
3645437 theyre just moving theyve been quiet theyve been going upstairs in the bedrooms and hiding behind the artifacts but they dont talk
3645438 they were old and we were hearing that they dont want kennels anymore
3645439 the best thing to do was get rid of them
3645440 that someone would shoot 70 dogs rather than spend money to do a vet check is extremely problematic
3645441 if the definition of a puppy mill is putting profits over care of the dogs this is a stark example of doing that
3645442 there are others ways to take care of the situation like in a court
3645443 he could have treated the dogs with medication for 40 or 50
3645444 every humane society in the state would have taken those dogs
3645445 swaraj self rule is my birth right and i will have it
3645446 in spite of the verdict of the jury i maintain that i am innocent there are higher powers that rule the destiny of men and nations and it may be the will of providence that the cause which i represent may prosper more by my suffering than my remaining free
3645447 south koreas park said yesterday that he will try his best to defeat you
3645448 so do you think in this planet is there anyone who can defeat you and if so who is it
3645449 to be at the top of so many great athletes
3645450 but it wasnt easy to put that race behind me
3645451 all the emotion that went into that relay i had friends texting me all afternoon saying i cant sleep im still fired up about that race and im not even out there
3645452 and im like well im not napping if you guys keep texting me
3645453 if we trained the horses like we did the people wed kill them
3645454 im awful at math during an interview session yesterday he admitted later that he has matured from a subject of the process to a student of it
3645455 i think the biggest part ive been able to improve on is my underwaters phelps said
3645456 for the first time ive been watching my kickouts my dives have been perfect the right number of kicks and the number of meters off the wall so im getting every little thing you can throw into the equation
3645457 ej sp g til side men kagen var da ganske vellykket
3645458 these groups worked very hard to ensure the spill had as little impact on the local environment as possible their contribution and co operation was invaluable to maritime new zealand and to the response operations ultimate success
3645459 i live a very simple life i dont go out to dinner much i dont travel much it is easy it wasnt always easy when i first started bliss music i was always scratching to make ends meet the music was well received but i didnt have any marketing or anything
3645460 because once you get into mp3s there is too much theft there is theft with cds you sell someone a cd and they make a copy for their friends but it is pretty low key once you sell mp3s there is no security around it anybody can download it and copy it
3645461 i just googled myself and a cd ocean euphoric of mine and fourth in line on the website was a russian website illegally selling mps of my music
3645462 everything was going great until three comics came out each playing a dead star one was playing heath ledger as the joker and he just kept listing prescription pills he had in his pocket another was playing estelle getty and the third was bernie macs ghost
3645463 she shields was so freaked out her eyes welled up and she actually bit her nails at one point when someone pretended to dump estelle gettys ashes on 30 rock actor jack mcbrayers head brooke got up and walked offstage she watched the rest of the show from behind a curtain backstage with a grimace
3645464 i have no personal knowledge of the facts of the case so i cant contribute much more than ive known vince for 100 years or so
3645465 i have no personal knowledge of the facts of the case so i cant contribute much more than ive known vince for 100 years or so
3645466 the forward swooping design allows the rider to steer with his shoulders currently only one stuntman in the world has the skills to drive it
3645467 im very proud to be an olympian now officially but were kind of putting that part of it behind us were here to get on the podium were here to win and to give our best performance were not happy with just being here
3645468 we face all of these teams that were going to play here we can play at that level we know we belong at this level and we want to perform a 1 1 draw is a point but we are disappointed we didnt put our best performance out there
3645469 we start at a younger age in that area its a little more well known when kids are growing up as opposed to soccer in other areas
3645470 were making leaps and bounds as far as our skill level goes
3645471 these young kids are the ones who are holding the standard for the group theyre kind of pushing us older kids
3645472 to have us back in the games as a female sport is phenomenal
3645473 thats something were proud of to have our young futures kids able to watch us on tv and see us in the media and be able to have those aspirations we did as kids watching the mary lou rettons of the world
3645474 heres a good one arsenal and united fans will buy into this one
3645475 if by here you mean this exact location i was cleaning out the nest of vampires however if you mean gotham i have a business meeting tomorrow
3645476 it was nice of you to see me on such short notice
3645477 what kind of game were you playing last night mr wayne
3645478 i have super good hearing and an amazing memory particularly for handsome jaws i know it was you in the bat suit
3645479 i was out patrolling he city to keep it safe i saw you surrounded by a dozen guys on that roof top and thought you were in trouble
3645480 it would have been close but i would have made it thanks for the help
3645481 so what was it you wanted to see me about
3645482 i came to see if the wayne charitable trust would be interested in investing in a school
3645483 i see what kind of school if you dont mind my asking
3645484 well the joyce summers school for gifted girls is a school for girls like me
3645485 actually mr wayne it was a good thing we ran into each other last night so you know what kind of girl i am talking about
3645486 what kind of girl is that i was too busy fighting to take much notice
3645487 what are slayers you called your self the slayer but you mean there are more of you
3645488 they love each other very much and want everyone to know that the matter was completely blown out of proportion
3645489 one of the points that has come across in my discussions with other european finance ministers is the widespread concern about the very high levels of profit taking and self reward that is taking place at the higher echelons of the private sector
3645490 we did run into a few hurdles and we didnt jump them too well last season
3645491 we started slowly and thats one of the things weve really addressed because with the season being so short you really have to start well
3645492 im feeling good feeling fresh so ill definitely put my hand up for selection
3645493 jed did a nice job in the limited plays that he had offensively but also on special teams
3645494 that fullback position youve got to produce on special teams or youre going to struggle to make it there collins did the best job of the other guys on the special teams unit
3645495 there are 11 starters on offense and 11 starters on defense if you aint one of them you better be good at special teams
3645496 special teams keeps you around and that gives you a chance to make plays in other ways
3645497 you can get in the rotation and get a chance to make plays on offense or defense because of what you do on special teams because if you dont make it on special teams you definitely wont get a chance to make it on offense or defense
3645498 weve got guys that have got to be major contributors on special teams
3645499 that is a major area of emphasis for us just making sure that we have the guys out there that can provide us the best chance of success
3645500 if you arent a starter you really have to make a living as a special teams player
3645501 there are a lot of good position players out there who cant play special teams who dont end up making it
3645502 special teams is an important part of the game its a third of it and a lot of valuable field position can be determined by it an older guy like myself i try to preach it to the younger guys
3645503 hemos aprobado en general los seis principios de alto el fuego y de arreglo del conflicto
3645504 necesitamos detalles legales resoluciones del consejo de seguridad de la onu y una mayor presencia de observadores internacionales sobre el terreno
3645505 iniciar a partir de ma ana el cumplimiento de los principios acordados
3645506 garantizar la soberan a integridad territorial y seguridad de georgia
3645507 completamente normal que rusia quiera defender los intereses de sus compatriotas en su pa s y los de los ruso parlantes fuera de sus fronteras
3645508 los pacificadores rusos cumplir n y seguir n cumpliendo sus funciones en el c ucaso
3645509 son un factor clave de la seguridad en el c ucaso
3645510 es extra a la situaci n cuando un personaje que perpetr miles de asesinatos es considerado terrorista y otro que hizo lo mismo es considerado presidente de un estado soberano elegido leg timamente el derecho internacional no puede tener un doble rasero
3645511 they provide an essential service to our communities local businesses and local economy and we recognise that these closures will cause considerable disruption
3645512 everything was strategically placed so the person could continue to take things
3645513 i cant think of a whole school year without a computer lab
3645514 we just dont have the finances to replace all those computers
3645515 um dem ansturm der kunden gerecht zu werden mussten wir eine neue druckmaschine kaufen nun k nnen wir unsere kunden ohne wartezeit beliefern und auch kurzfristig ganze hochzeitsgesellschaften ausstatten
3645516 i dont think anyone out there thought he hit it if that had been for a gold medal i would have been protesting
3645517 the referees have to be in unison but there was a lot of doubt about a lot of the shots out there
3645518 im glad it wasnt for a gold medal because that is all that this games would have been remembered for unfortunately
3645519 id hate to think that but you get the feeling out there when someone clearly misses all the shooters out there can tell if he missed or hit it
3645520 the crowd were yelling and calling shots in and out
3645521 it was like a circus out there it would have been a brave chinese judge that would have put his hand up to signify a miss
3645522 the position i finished in is well above the position i am in the world
3645523 unfortunately the chinese shooter was in front of me so i had to wait every time after he shot before the noise died down
3645524 i am not using this as an excuse but i dont have much opportunity to practice in front of a crowd of 10 000
3645525 but i have learnt a lot today it proves you can teach an old dog new tricks

3645528 it is an honor for any film company to have music composed and arranged by adnan sami and lyrics by sameersaab but it is a rare honour to have such a collection of the greats singing for us pandit jasrajji ashaji parveen sultanji shubha mudgalji and kailash khersaab films are made for audiences and from the first promo that came on the television we have been getting some much encouragement from within and outside the fraternity 1920 is a supernatural film but more than that it is a great love story and an even greater story about a man and his god
3645529 he misses me and cant wait to hang out again after foster care
3645530 i heard you were into this sort of thing that youre the best around

3645534 wir haben jetzt eine wachsende anzahl an adoptierten leuten die bei uns getestet und bereinstimmungen bei einigen personen mit einem bestimmten familiennamen gefunden haben und evtl hatten sie keine bereinstimmungen mit jemandem mit einem anderen nachnamen dadurch k nnen sie zu dem schluss kommen dass sie zu mindest den familiennamen gefunden haben nach dem sie in ihrer geburtsstadt suchen m ssen
3645535 wenn man einen nachnamen hat der einigerma en selten ist aber nicht so selten dass die chance einer anderen typisierten person in der datenbank winzig ist dann k nnte man gl ck haben es ist eine gro e lotterie aber wie sagt man manchmal wenn man in einem dunklen raum ist kann sogar ein kleines licht n tzlich sein
3645536 state vessels and aircraft may continue to enjoy sovereign immunity after sinking wherever they are located
3645537 i feel incredibly fortunate to have been given the opportunity to offer the world of givenchy haute couture to madonna the icon the artist the woman for whom i have so much respect and admiration
3645538 we will consider this request for extradition but it wont take too long chief judge nyoman gede wirya said
3645539 the victim had been with friends at his home celebrating an associates birthday
3645540 present at the family home were the victims mother father and other family members
3645541 to instruct forces to urgently overcome the consequences helping people stabilise life and keep updating damages
3645542 if we dont change her now well have to wait until next year which could be late
3645543 if the girl starts menstruating while serving as kumari it is considered inauspicious
3645544 because i think pretty soon its going to be your surname britney brand
3645545 if britney performs at the vmas and she pulls it off it will be the greatest comeback kid story ever its not that hard to do better than last year but she cant just do ok fine or mediocre her comeback performance has to be big
3645546 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3645547 we want television screens in the west to be showing not only russian tanks and saying russia is at war in south ossetia and with georgia but also to be showing the suffering of the ossetian people the murdered elderly people and children the destroyed towns of south ossetia and tskhinvali this would be an objective way of presenting the material
3645548 we cannot create an anti russia coalition in europe and on this point we are close to putins position
3645549 russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
3645550 look if were going to do something about nuclear proliferation just to take one issue that i think is as important as any on the list weve got to have russia involved
3645551 the amount of loose nuclear material that is floating around in the former soviet union the amount of technical know how that is in countries that used to be behind the iron curtain without russias cooperation our efforts in that on that front will be greatly weakened

3645556 nagustuhan ni mister robert malengreau ang pelikula kaya inihahanda na namin lahat ang mga requirements
3645557 im very happy dahil namulat ang censors para mapanood ito ng mga kabataan para magkaroon sila ng good lesson in life dapat talagang maging open na tayo sa mga ganitong klase ng pelikula para awakening sa mga bata
3645558 may moral lesson po ang pelikula para sa mga kabataan lalo na sa mga nag aasawa nang maaga
3645559 i got inspired by the article titled destierro and had it clipped then i handed the story to scriptwriter jun lana who turned a very colorful account to a wonderful screenplay
3645560 universal ang theme ng pelikula kaya tama lang na mapanood ng maraming mga tao sa ibat ibang bansa
3645561 ako in favor of federalism pero kung gagamitin ng malaca ang for their own selfish agenda baka dapat maghinay hinay muna kami
3645562 nagaalala ako bakit sinasakyan nila bigla ang federalism malinaw from the start na gusto nila manatili beyond 2010
3645563 kung nag start ba kami ng hearing o discussion sa floor yun na ba ang start ng con ass yan ang dapat pag aralan
3645564 the question is timing marami nagtatanong vehicle ba ito para patagalin ang administrasyon sa kanyang pwesto kami sa senado the consensus is if there would be any amendment it should be after 2010
3645565 for them to deny us that information and for them to say we are to blame if federalism does not succeed is grossly unfair
3645566 in their mind because the way i look at it di talaga uubra na magkaroon tayo ng cha cha ngayon sapagkat yung sinasabi na magkaroon ng federalism tumayo nga agad ako kahapon at sinagot ko yun sabi ko pabor ako sa federalist government pero di tayo dapat magbago ng constitution until after 2010
3645567 the secretary general appeals for restraint protection of all civilians as well as access for the provision of speedy humanitarian assistance to the affected population
3645568 let us be very clear resolution no 10 has no intention whatsoever to extend her term or my term or anybody elses term its only purpose is the adoption of the federal system of government
3645569 its systems go for charter change and we are supporting joint congressional resolution 10 which is pending in the senate
3645570 our forces on the ground are withdrawing from the conflict areas so we expect fighting to end by tomorrow wednesday
3645571 we thank the swiss government not only for the values of freedom and civil rights that are enshrined in its culture but also for its willingness to share in its experience of federalism through the institute of federalism located in fribourg in switzerland which has been helping us do our studies on this form of government we advocate federalism as a way to ensure long lasting peace in mindanao
3645572 we have made progress but we will need your support to get the job done for the fundamental change in our political system
3645573 our present form of government has many gridlocks which have become a hindrance to our socio economic growth
3645574 i said the search for peace must be constitutional but the constitution must serve the quest for peace and i believe that we have a better chance for lasting peace and development in mindanao if indeed we have a federal form of government
3645575 federalism is not merely a political form it will have substantive implications on the political economy of the nation therefore we must address the issue of economic viability and the preparedness of component states from our present situation as an archipelago the next transition is now to gear towards a wider distribution of economic zones such as those pioneered successfully right here in china then towards autonomy and then to statehood as for the shift to the parliamentary form of government it must be spearheaded i believe and again it must be spearheaded by meaningful political reforms particularly a law on political parties that would spur the rehabilitation of our societal organizations and mass movements and cleaning up of our electoral processes
3645576 ours is a country divided the story of our nation is a tale of two philippines almost as it were two countries under the same name
3645577 perhaps we politicians have done our best but maybe our best is not enough given the present system perhaps we have strained the present political system to its final limit it is time to turn to the people bring them into government and change the way that government is done
3645578 the economic progress and social stability of the provinces along with the increasing self reliance and efficiency of political developments and public services there make a compelling case for federalism perhaps its time to take the power from the center to the countryside that feeds it
3645579 the general aim is to improve on your personal best break the philippine record if you can the sea games record and take it from there
3645580 everyone thinks that if we automate the elections then all our problems will go away however if you look at the experience of the united states and other countries who have automated their elections the old problems still persist and new problems crop up
3645581 the lives of people especially the youth who will sign up on the red list will definitely be in the red meaning stepping into the danger zone

3645594 with the cost of living spiralling out of control tenants are unlikely to be willing to wear increased rental demands
3645595 those landlords wishing to remortgage buy to let properties will find it difficult with lenders demanding sizeable deposits or charging higher rates
3645596 this could force landlords to re evaluate whether it is worthwhile staying in the sector in the current climate
3645597 the lack of immediate decisive action from the government following last weeks speculation surrounding the possible scrapping of stamp duty is already having a negative impact on the housing market
3645598 we warned implementation of a stamp duty suspension would need to be pushed through straight away if it was to be successful and avoid bringing further stagnation to the market
3645599 the possibility of avoiding this tax is too appealing to home buyers who are reluctant to fork out tens of thousands of pounds for something they may be able to bypass in a matter of weeks and as a result some buyers are stalling

3645612 het was de rit van mijn leven hier droom ik al van sinds ik een kind was toen ik over de streep kwam heeft men mij gezegd dat ik de beste tijd had maar ik durfde niet meteen hopen op de gouden medaille
3645613 ik wou eerst nog op de laatste concurrente wachten ik wou het op het bord zien staan ik train veel op de piste waardoor ik de nodige macht heb op het dalende en het vlakke stuk waar het tegenwind was ik zei tegen mezelf het is nu of nooit de olympische spelen zijn maar een keer om de vier jaar
3645614 op het wereldkampioenschap van madrid 2005 ben ik beginnen denken aan het podium van de spelen ik was vorig jaar tweede en het was moeilijk om de regenboogtrui opnieuw af te staan maar dit was eigenlijk een geluk bij een ongeluk want zo werd ik verplicht om vele kleine details te bekijken ik ben in december naar hier gekomen om de klim te bekijken want het is geen tijdrit zoals we gewoon zijn om te rijden
3645615 ein m glicherweise sogar feindliches bernahmeangebot halten wir f r schwierig und unwahrscheinlich
3645616 vooral omdat het mijn beste match ooit was tegen haar ze heeft een heel goede worp en die heb ik kunnen blokkeren maar dan verlies ik met een golden score het is geen kwestie van fysiek want ik denk dat zij zelfs kapotter zat dan ik ik moet de beelden nog eens bekijken maar ik denk dat zij heeft overgenomen en zo heeft gescoord
3645617 voor hetzelfde geld had ik echter kunnen winnen iets voordien had ik haar in een armklem maar de scheidsrechter zei dat ik op haar kin aan het werken was terwijl ik enkel haar kraag vast had
3645618 ik had gedacht dat scapin wel door zou gaan want ze is heel sterk en heeft heel veel ervaring
3645619 ik heb haar kamp echter niet gezien maar ik denk dat ze verrast is geweest misschien was ze iets te laat geconcentreerd
3645620 ik ga nu even uitblazen maar het is absoluut niet de bedoeling om te stoppen
3645621 ik heb er absoluut nog zin in en ik voelde me hier eindelijk voor de eerste keer in twee jaar weer goed ik heb hard op mijn tanden moeten bijten om te staan waar ik nu sta dus ik ga er nu zeker niet de brui aan geven
3645622 nu alle ploegen aan het werk zijn ondervindt het luchtverkeer geen hinder meer en kunnen alle vliegtuigen op het voorziene uur vertrekken
3645623 er zijn nog enkele vluchten die afgelast zijn het gaat om zogenaamde night stops vluchten die s avonds aankomen en pas de volgende ochtend vertrekken de vluchten die gisterenavond hadden moeten aankomen hebben dat natuurlijk niet gedaan waardoor ze ook niet kunnen vertrekken maar wie vandaag moet vliegen zou geen hinder mogen ondervinden we raden de mensen wel aan hun vluchtinformatie nog eens te checken
3645624 het is de eerste keer dat we met een dergelijke situatie geconfronteerd zijn en we weten dus niet goed waar we ons aan moeten verwachten we schatten in dat het toch een week zal duren voor alles terecht is misschien kan het sneller maar even goed duurt het wat langer

3645634 i want to provide some tools some very specific tools to ensure that maxwell is given the ability to break down barriers if they exist and on top of that i want to give her tools to strengthen her theatre so that she can create better theatre make more money and put more bums in seats
3645635 is not about taking a financial loss to do something good
3645636 they cant do a play with a large black cast because they have to cross cast through the season and you cant get a black actor to be a lead in other plays because it would affect box office

3645652 then the lord rained on sodom and gomorrah brimstone and fire from the lord out of heaven
3645653 i sent a plague among you after the manner of egypt i slew your young men by the sword along with your captured horses and i made the stench of your camp rise up in your nostrils yet you have not returned to me declares the lord
3645654 thus says the lord the king of israel and his redeemer the lord of hosts i am the first and i am the last and there is no god besides me
3645655 now when abram was ninety nine years old the lord appeared to abram and said to him
3645656 now the lord appeared to him by the oaks of mamre while he was sitting at the tent door in the heat of the day
3645657 god spoke further to moses and said to him i am the lord and i appeared to abraham isaac and jacob as god almighty but by my name lord i did not make myself known to them
3645658 then moses went up with aaron nadab and abihu and seventy of the elders of israel and they saw the god of israel and under his feet there appeared to be a pavement of sapphire as clear as the sky itself yet he did not stretch out his hand against the nobles of the sons of israel and they beheld god and they ate and drank
3645659 thus the lord used to speak to moses face to face just as a man speaks to his friend
3645660 but he god said you cannot see my face for no man can see me and live
3645661 no man has seen god at any time the only begotten god who is in the bosom of the father he has explained him
3645662 god who alone possesses immortality and dwells in unapproachable light whom no man has seen or can see
3645663 not that any man has seen the father except the one who is from god he has seen the father
3645664 and god said to moses i am who i am and he said thus you shall say to the sons of israel i am has sent me to you
3645665 and i god will pour out on the house of david and on the inhabitants of jerusalem the spirit of grace and of supplication so that they will look on me whom they have pierced and they will mourn for him as one mourns for an only son

3645694 this contract will assist greatly in reducing operating costs and allow the operation to reach its full potential
3645695 portman is also surprised that golden west has summarised a pricing schedule which is purported to apply before the commencement of operations at oakajee port as it has not outlined an alternative rail and port system from which it would propose to ship ore from wiluna west before oakajee becomes operational
3645696 the issue was caused by a temporary outage in our contacts system that was preventing gmail from loading properly
3645697 we dont usually post about problems like this on our blog but we wanted to make an exception in this case since so many people were impacted
3645698 we heard loud and clear today how much people care about their gmail accounts we followed all the e mails to our support team and user group we fielded phone calls from google apps customers and friends and we saw the many twitter posts we also heard from plenty of googlers who use gmail for company e mail we never take for granted the commitment weve made to running an e mail service that you can count on
3645699 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3645700 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3645701 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3645702 this is like a voiceover for a cartoon character why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3645703 they want the best looking people to represent the face of china i dont blame the organizers for picking a prettier looking kid over the not so pretty one
3645704 its the unfortunate reality that these sort of things turn political

3645707 the hedge funds have decided to operate on the rails they took them down big today the pattern when the hedge funds go after a particular group is that day one it looks like theyre so far low you have to buy them and then they come back and they pound them and then they pound them again i think that there is at least 10 more downside to every one of the rails i cannot endorse them here
3645708 remember i said cleveland cliffs must be sold after they bought that coal company they paid too much at the top of the cycle for coal so i do not want cleveland cliffs apache there are other natural gas companies that are now cheaper but cleveland cliffs is a no no theyre overpaying in order to block their own takeover
3645709 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3645710 the national interest requires that the girl should have good looks and a good grasp of the song and look good on screen
3645711 lin miaoke was the best in this and yang peiyis voice was the most outstanding
3645712 he is just a normal person but maybe from a different planet
3645713 growing up i always wanted to be an olympian now to be the most decorated olympian of all time it just sounds weird saying it started setting in a little bit after the butterfly i was just trying to focus on my next race but i just kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time its a pretty cool title im definitely honored
3645714 ive got three races left so there had better be something left in the tank
3645715 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race
3645716 there is nobody in our sport that can win like he wins

3645719 its the most fun thing to be in a team environment and be part of a relay its cool when you get four americans who all swim well together everyone has to play their part or its just not going to happen weve been lucky that weve been able to do that
3645720 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3645721 any medal in an event that is not on your regular program is great
3645722 i went out there and i raced tough and thats all i can do
3645723 it was definitely a tough day but i think i handled it pretty well
3645724 sentiment in the aussie of course has been very weak for the last two weeks since the rba reserve bank of australia suggested they are likely to shift to cutting interest rates
3645725 im actually still very nervous because of the fact that at the end of the day the market is still quite long aussie and the question is are there a lot more accounts that need to offload it
3645726 there were a lot of speculative positions being taken off the table because a lot of japanese traders had been heavily long aussie yen and also kiwi yen
3645727 those are starting to hurt and we are seeing quite a rapid unwinding of that leading to aussie dollar coming under some pretty decent pressure
3645728 ceasing production of coated fish allows us to focus on our frozen meals division which is an area of growth for vesco foods
3645729 we have invested approximately 2 million over the past 18 months in frozen meal infrastructure and equipment at our osborne park site in western australia to meet increasing demand
3645730 after 34 years the decision to stop producing coated fish is sad news for some of our longest serving and very loyal employees
3645731 however it signals an exciting future for frozen meal production in western australia and many of those people who work in the osborne park coated fish production plant have an important ongoing role to play in the company within our growing frozen meals division

3645736 woe to you who are well fed now for you will go hungry
3645737 there was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and lived in luxury every day at his gate was laid a beggar named lazarus covered with sores and longing to eat what fell from the rich mans table
3645738 blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness for they will be satisfied
3645739 but seek first the kingdom of god and his righteousness
3645740 for unless you righteousness surpasses that of the pharisees and the teachers of the law you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven

3645756 we think we have a pretty good handle on the situation we thought we were relatively conservative but well see how it goes
3645757 obviously this isnt something that we absolutely need to do but we stepped up to do it because we think its the right thing to do

3645761 working on an immediate patch for customers in production vmware expects to fix the issue in code in the next 36 hours once qa testing has been completed
3645762 this certainly appears to be the most publicized bug for vmware so far and i think it is damaging to vmware and virtualization as a whole the hypervisor is the lowest software level on the server and if you have an issue like this boom all your infrastructure is down
3645763 software will always have bugs but a widespread issue like this that affects all vms is really damaging especially at this point in time where virtualization is starting to take off vmware is going to have to fix this fast provide an explanation and outline what they will do to strengthen their qa in the future
3645764 weve just encountered a serious bug with our esx cluster serious enough that i thought i should post about it here as a prior warning for others running esx 3 5 update 2
3645765 as enterprises move towards a fully virtualized infrastructure issues like this certainly will make people think about adopting multiple hypervisors and not putting all your eggs in one basket
3645766 if you are 100 virtualized using a single vendor one software bug or an exploitable security flaw in the hypervisor could instantly freeze your entire infrastructure these are the risks you take if you have a monoculture weve seen it before with things like windows ie etc
3645767 we were proactively notified by vmware monday they told us these are the symptoms and what would happen if you powered down your virtual machines
3645768 they gave us the general prescription in terms of troubleshooting and things to avoid such as powering down

3645782 our operating plan for the year ahead assumes that the nickel price will remain around current levels and that chinese demand for philippine direct shipping ore will continue to be muted
3645783 given the delay in achieving forecasted sales exacerbated by the continued overall negative economic sentiment found in the uk administrative expenditure since the end of march has continued to be handled tightly
3645784 as a result of the delay in sales the balance of cash used to finance ongoing general administrative expenditure has not been supplemented from cash generated from trading activities as anticipated
3645785 great technology and world class customer service are imperative in online advertising and i believe that thanks to its independence and focus on delivering what it does best specific media delivers on both
3645786 it is a company that fully understands the value of anonymous consumer data and how to use that data to the benefit of advertisers publishers and the users themselves there is an established pecking order in the online advertising space and i feel confident that specific media can make significant inroads into that over the coming months
3645787 an industry heavyweight such as colin joining the specific media team in europe is a real feather in our cap
3645788 we only entered the european market through the acquisition of adviva in march 2008 and growing our footprint there is of key strategic importance for the company colin has as impressive and extensive experience in the industry as you could find and we are looking forward to him driving the company forward alongside the rest of our european team

3645792 we want to bring the tremendous quality of independently published titles which generally arent produced in audio to the hundreds of thousands of people who experience literature through listening
3645793 as soon as we see crude oil prices correcting there is a correction in cairn and vis vis one should look at booking profit and the preference is more towards the rate sensitive and therefore to that extent that money could be deployed in maybe banking capital goods similar such sectors given the view that maybe crude oil prices the worse is over and we should see a gradual correction even from these levels and maybe the bottom for crude would be around usd 100 bbl or thereabouts if one have to that view then more or less at these levels one should look at exiting out of it
3645794 we are negative on itc and the results for the company were not encouraging at all they have been trying to make success out of the fmcg business but that continues to act as a drain on the performance of the company and therefore we would like to remain underweight or nil weight in itc at this point of time
3645795 in fertilisers nagarjuna would be interesting in the lower levels and would make a good buy as well my advice would be to stick on with the stock we are expecting some government action in the fertilizer industry as you know the kind of subsidies and the shortages the industry is facing it is in a bit of a crisis situation and this crisis will nudge the government to take some steps and whatever steps they take i think it will be positive for existing fertilizer units also with the kg gas basin the gas in the basin coming on line the priorities will be given to fertilizer units and nagarjuna could be a major beneficiary there on the whole we are positive on the industry and for nagarjuna as a whole but for itc we would recommend exiting out

3645799 we can then look to the issue of how to resolve the longstanding frozen conflicts of south ossetia and abkhazia

3645807 ignorance and obscurantism have never produced anything other than flocks of slaves for tyranny
3645808 we want the eu to acknowledge the aggression by russia
3645809 we have to discuss and revise our negotiations because russias actions constitute a clear violation of international law and the united nations charter and such actions should have consequences
3645810 central and eastern european countries might like to take the opportunity to take a swipe at the russians as one would expect
3645811 they may put these things forward but i would not necessarily say thats going to be the outcome

3645837 i am just relieved we got through without having to pay anything the whole thing started in november and it has been a rollercoaster of emotions
3645838 all of a sudden we had to find 10 000 it would have been a lot to pay and could have sent us under it was suggested we should fold the business rather than pay the money but i didnt want to do that because it has taken me so long to set up the business the way it is
3645839 if it hadnt been for our solicitor it could have been a far worse situation

3645843 our troops have virtually cleared all barangays villages affected while the group of umbra kato have left the clearing process including the removal of mines and explosives laid by the rebels as they left are still being conducted
3645844 what we are doing right now is mere procedural like mine clearing because the group of umbra kato had left many mines we are not yet recommending the return of the civilians because of possible mines
3645845 the areas where there were presence of milf rebels under ameril umbra are already cleared the ones that were left there are the milf members who are natives in the area they kato and his group are no longer there
3645846 they followed the resolution of the committee of the milf and the grp for them to reposition thats what happened
3645847 unser gesch ftsmodell erweist sich als zukunftsgerichtet und tragf hig auch unter erschwerten bedingungen

3645849 with people of all ages texting furiously at all hours of the day we are starting to realize the toll texting places on our hands fingers and wrists
3645850 there is a growing need for new behaviours and services that reduce the wear and tear on users without impeding their ability to communicate
3645851 text messaging has become deeply woven into the fabric of our culture in recent years
3645852 we believe there is a need to offer consumers a way to retain the ability to send messages without being disabled by doing so its easier and potentially much less painful just to speak a text instead

3645856 any slowdown in the japanese economy is likely to be relatively modest
3645857 i recently received a page from the washington post june 19 2008 page a9
3645858 since the advertisement states that the cabin is from fbi vault it is clear that the government is responsible for the public exhibition of the cabin this has obvious relevance to the victims objection to publicity connected with the unabom case
3645859 g men and journalists top news stories of the fbis first century
3645860 the cabin is one of 200 artifacts that were offered to us through the fbi the unabomber is an interesting case of the combative sometimes cooperative relationship of the press with the fbi
3645861 the cabin had a definite media hook since the artifact was provided by the fbi and we think it is a dramatic way of retelling the story to visitors we intend to keep it as part of the exhibit
3645862 ive got no reports of any border incidents any cross border incidents so it wasnt us

3645865 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

3645877 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3645878 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3645879 of all the housemates he wants to be here the least and when someone does feel that way it makes it harder to get on with them in the house
3645880 she doesnt actually say some things she makes you feel uncomfortable with the way she is acting
3645881 we are prepared to make these investments because we believe in the value of education we believe in the value of publicly funded education
3645882 and i believe that these proposed changes in the four year collective agreement are good for the system they are good for students and they are good for individual teachers
3645883 we will not sign a long term collective agreement with any school board that does not eliminate the gap
3645884 we dont know what to expect in the next week the next month we just dont know
3645885 i honestly expected somebody either the mayor or the city councillor to be here
3645886 thats all people want is to be able to believe theyre going to be taken care of
3645887 it just gave me the shivers it was so eerie so creepy
3645888 i feel like it is so scary to be in here i dont feel safe in here now
3645889 thats why were doing this project i was hoping to get this done before things like this happened again
3645890 i know theyre getting anxious but if we can get the one single zoning bylaw through it makes it easier to amend for all kinds of issues
3645891 to point fingers at anybody at this point we just dont know
3645892 we have a significant robust safety system in place today
3645893 its absolutely insane and woefully inadequate if youve set yourself up as the public safety watchdog for that industry sector
3645894 i think what this has shown us is the approved regulator may well be asleep at the switch
3645895 we need to understand what caused the explosion to understand how we can best move to protect the residents of toronto
3645896 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3645897 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3645898 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3645899 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3645900 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3645901 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3645902 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3645903 apple ceo steve jobs has confirmed that the iphone 3g has a kill switch that can remotely remove software from the devices
3645904 hopefully we never have to pull that lever but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull
3645905 the kill switch is a very controlling gesture i am not sure why apple didnt disclose it up front as simply a security measure
3645906 consumers will accept an awful lot if you let them know what they are accepting
3645907 no one else made mistakes so its kind of my fault
3645908 i think everybody knows you always have good days and bad days i just wish today was a good day
3645909 the chinese womens gymnastics team made history today showing the world the china womens gymnastics team is the greatest
3645910 before they go out there i want them to believe in themselves and they all did
3645911 i didnt have to say anything to them even though they are very young they have a lot of experience as well and they have their own ways to learn from their own experiences and they used those ways
3645912 we are human when it comes down to it we make mistakes and it came down to china had a better day today give us another day we could probably come out on top
3645913 i was just eager to do my routine and get the show on the road
3645914 the judges decided to hold me and i guess i just let my nerves get the best of me
3645915 just shake it off thats all you can do shake it off
3645916 i guess it was a little too hard to get out of the funk
3645917 tra questi due generi non cera nulla di veramente rilevante
3645918 spore mira a riempire questo vuoto con un prodotto che propone un genere di interazione asincrona tra i giocatori a mio modo di vedere questo sistema permette di creare cooperazione tra i giocatori per arrivare a un mondo enorme e in grado di sorprendere in ogni situazione
3645919 per spore ho cercato di riuscire ad arrivare a questi obbiettivi scavalcando tutte quelle che sono le limitazioni dei normali titoli massivi

3645921 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3645922 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3645930 now is the ideal opportunity for me to permanently get a fixed position at number three and it is up to me to grab that opportunity it is now a time in my career where i should not see myself or allow other people to see me as a young player any more
3645931 a lot of the players when i first walked into the dressing room are no longer around and i have 43 test caps so it is time to step up and deliver certainly i have been up and down the order throughout my test match career but more recently i have settled at five
3645932 that is where i have put in my best performances but as a player you always want to test yourself and be as good as you possibly can be you look at the best players in the world and a lot of them bat at number three or number four
3645933 el objetivo de la operaci n para imponer la paz se ha cumplido la seguridad de las tropas de paz y de los ciudadanos rusos est garantizada

3645945 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3645946 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race
3645947 i wanted a world record i wanted 1 51 or better but in the circumstances not too bad i guess
3645948 michael phelps has become the greatest gold medal winner in the olympics history
3645949 i was actually thinking about it on the medal ceremony
3645950 i was trying to get ready for the relay keep my mood focused i kept fighting myself every time i started thinking about the gold medal record tearing up a little bit
3645951 the people who came before us and competed in the olympic games are some of the greatest athletes who ever lived and to win the most gold medals its unbelievable i just have no idea what to say
3645952 it might be once a century you see something like this
3645953 new services and trials are being announced almost every day judging from the response from users so far to services like m pesa and smartmoney prospects for these services are excellent both in developing and developed countries for many people it has been costly and difficult for them to transfer money via existing services even to friends and family using mobile phones solves the problem
3645954 i still dont think weve played anywhere close to our best basketball
3645955 theyve been through the fire already and played a lot of high level games
3645956 los paneles solares son por lo general muy pero muy caros y dif ciles de elaborar ante esta constataci n optaron por emplear otro m todo en cierta forma se podr a comparar con la fotos ntesis es decir la manera en que las plantas captan energ a de la luz solar al igual que las hojas el peque o panel tambi n es verde y flexible la ventaja radica en que es irrompible y para que no moleste puede plegarse en un poste o colocarse en un techo de cinc si bien suministra menos energ a que un panel solar com n tambi n hay que resaltar que es cien veces m s econ mico

3645959 excuse me is there an airport nearby large enough for a private jet to land
3645960 im sorry they were in my room the whole time
3645961 dont steal a police car unless youre prepared to floor it all the way to mexico
3645962 it was always going to be the case with fuelwatch and im particularly unsurprised about the comments from mr xenophon this morning
3645963 of course in the lead up to the vote in the senate we will be taking senator xenophon up on his offer of discussion and if theres anything he can propose that meets his concerns while meeting the fundamental policy aims of the government to get more transparency in the petrol market and get rid of what is effectively collusion in the market we will be happy to talk that through
3645964 there are severe criminal penalties for collusion and on that basis we strongly suggest that any suggestion of collusion in the petrol market be supported by factual evidence rather than throwing around baseless accusations
3645965 we support more information being provided to the consumer and we acknowledge that the average motoring consumer may not understand the different elements that make up the price of petrol at the pump let alone many of the products they pick up off the grocery shelf
3645966 but this lack of information should not be confused with transparency
3645967 there are some sports where certain countries or races hold a natural genetic edge over others
3645968 take distance running for instance where a particular tribe from the ethiopian highlands has dominated the world stage we wanted to choose a discipline where there are no such entry barriers also archery has a lot of multicultural heroes surrounding it robin hood william tell and closer home arjuna so with proper motivation and rigorous practice its easier to get the kids excited about it
3645969 initially it was quite dull to have to keep plucking away at a bowstring to try and hit a target that looked no bigger than a thumbtack over and over again it was inconvenient to get up at every morning to get to the practice sessions on time and difficult to communicate in sign language with a coach who spoke only hindi and bengali
3645970 we didnt understand the sport either and occasionally pranitha would protest against going
3645971 where she gets her excellent physique from i dont know it doesnt seem to be from them
3645972 pranitha has an iron will to succeed and a strong self improvement streak
3645973 theyve given me better equipment and theres uninterrupted training time im also living with other athletes so were constantly exchanging tips
3645974 so familiar is the sound of a bow twang and the sight of kids lined up before their target in their crisply starched navy and white uniforms that if theyre not there its as if something is missing
3645975 this performance in the world cup has given me a lot of hope and confidence and i will try my best to realise the dream of bagging an olympic medal

3645978 m me le gars de la s curit la roport au canada ma demand si c tait vrai
3645979 there wasnt a period in my life like serena went through where i was doing drugs and having sex with my best friends boyfriend
3645980 come here big boy let me wrap my legs around you and feel your cock harden in my scissor grip oh what a big dick you have it would look nice between my little feet dont you think now bend over and be my lit
3645981 its something about the engine revving between my legs that r
3645982 niemand kan zich de eerste dagen anders voordoen dan hij of zij is en dat zorgt gelijk voor een enorme teamspirit maar voor hoe lang heerst deze spirit en kun je daarmee bergen verzetten
3645983 in truth it has proved a lot more difficult than i anticipated for my family to settle in the area and the club has been very supportive and understanding of my decision
3645984 i would like to thank the players and the fans for their fantastic support and i wish the la galaxy much success in the future
3645985 i would now like to spend some time with my family before considering any other position in football
3645986 after the san jose loss various reports claimed there was friction between lalas and gullit surfaced
3645987 we are stepping up and doing what we need to do to straighten this thing out
3645988 the players have to look deep inside themselves and understand they have to be responsible for some of this
3645989 am i angry we find ourselves in the situation we find ourselves in yes the galaxy havent made the playoffs for a couple years punting on this season is not acceptable
3645990 the clubhas reportedly thrived from a business standpoint over the past few years due in large part to the marketing power of beckham l a now sells out nearly every game at the hdc and draws
3645991 capello will pick the captain in terms of his values but i have expressed admiration for people who have captained the side in the last few months
3645992 there are a number of issues that get frustrating in terms of how to make our competition better and how to work together as football clubs with the commission to do that
3645993 i want to see wa footy be the second best competition in australia and at the moment we are kidding ourselves if we think that is the case
3645994 id like to see some security at breaks especially around the huddles we are inviting something to happen by letting it continue how it is why should we wait to act on something after its happened lets put in some measures now to ensure things dont get out of hand
3645995 it could be as simple as roping off an area around the huddles or having both teams and the umpires in the centre square and having security around it its a good initiative to have people allowed on the oval but i think its setting ourselves up for something to happen that we dont want
3645996 around the playing group at quarter and three quarter time you sometimes have to be mindful of whos standing around while we dont want to discourage people getting on the field we can put measures in place to ensure theres a safer distance between spectators and players
3645997 its disappointing because we want the oval to be some sort of centre of excellence and at the moment it gets in a terrible condition quite quickly when it rains
3645998 it gets no more use than any other ground that has the league and colts teams training on it every night of the week and we need to make sure both clubs work together with the town of vincent to make sure something is done at the end of the year to put in a surface that handles the traffic and rain i cant see it being too difficult
3645999 jeremy played 60 games and couple of premierships with the royals whilst he was at the eagles and its not just us it has affected a guy like james walker was classified as an interstate player at south fremantle and that meant david dawes had to be let go by them
3646000 he walker gave 12 years of service to wa football and those are the types of instances where commonsense should prevail but it doesnt at the moment decisions must be made that are best for the competition and thats not what is happening to restrict clubs to recruiting six interstate players is wrong given that the vfl have alignments with afl clubs and it makes it tough for vfl players to actually get a game at those clubs
3646001 they are some of the things that our footy club has been vocal about with the commission we all want to improve the competition to make it a better standard and to attract quality players to clubs where they arent getting much game time at other clubs we were disappointed we didnt get marty and whyman was another one we signed but couldnt get him over to wa
3646002 those two players would have added the pace to our side that we need and theres some issues that the commission needs to address sometimes i dont think we do ourselves justice to make our competition as good as it can be by restricting interstate players into the competition they can only make our competition better and if we want to have a high quality league then there shouldnt be restrictions on the players that can come into it
3646003 you hope they do listen and im sure the commission have their own agenda i know one of their strong agendas is developing local players but there are inequalities in that because the zones arent equal in size and the amount of talent they produce
3646004 east perths zone has noranda bayswater morley and mt lawley its not as great as east fremantles and claremonts for instance where they have players fall off trees year after year they cant just say that they want a local competition they have to make good decisions to support all clubs
3646005 we voiced our disapproval at the brent connelly situation and felt that it made sense to make the allocation based on 2008 ladder positions but instead it was done based on where we finished in 2007
3646006 at the time connelly was moved perth was second and we were second last so common sense didnt prevail and the decision wasnt made with the best interests of the young player in mind and didnt even up the number of afl players on the lists
3646007 they will defend it by saying they went by the rule book but sometimes someone is going to have to make tough decisions so the right outcome gets reached weve had eight games from afl players which is the lowest equal with subiaco but the difference there is they have a lot more experienced wafl and former afl players
3646008 when they talk about inequality and evening it up its not happening when the commission promotes that they want an equal competition they have to make decisions that get the best outcome for all involved
3646009 weve lost four players in the last few drafts interstate and while you get money for that you dont get any compensation with players and that is quite ludicrous east fremantle and other clubs lose players to the draft but then regain players in the reverse draft and that to me doesnt make sense and theres no logic in it at all
3646010 i thoroughly enjoy it we have a very good bunch of guys who are determined to taste more finals and be as successful as possible weve always known it would be a big job developing the group after the club recruited heavily a number of years ago and ignored the younger players
3646011 we have felt the effect of that in the last couple of years because we havent had the game tallies into the younger players that we should have had and a lot of them left because of that we now have a good bunch of guys are working hard and we believe our future is very bright
3646012 we are working through the process now and everything has to be negotiated ive got a proposal into the club about how i want to structure us in order to be successful and what i think we need to do so we are working through that and hopefully can make an announcement in the coming weeks
3646013 its touching how american neoconservatives who have no regard for international law when they want to invade some troublesome country have developed a sudden reverence for national sovereignty apparently context is everything so the united states attacking grenada or nicaragua or panama or iraq or serbia is justified even if the reasons sometimes dont hold water or dont hold up before the united nations the hague or other institutions of international law
3646014 blackwater worldwide the contractor whose provision of private security in iraq has been under scrutiny and its affiliated companies may have improperly obtained more than 100 million in contracts meant for small businesses according to federal auditors
3646015 as low as i set the price youre the first person to call
3646016 theres never been discounts this big before on them but people are still shying away
3646017 were not going to order any 09s for a while
3646018 these big trucks and suvs are really dinosaurs at this point
3646019 you pay for the car just once but you go to the pump every week so that almost seems more important to you every time you go to the pump you just want to feel good about it

3646040 this is koharu we need immediate extraction from the mutant prison
3646041 i need to find goto san before that and get her out of there
3646042 no time to explain we have to get out of here
3646043 just give me a second i need to find something extremely important
3646044 i just wish i could have done more to save the others trapped in that building
3646045 i know koharu but we didnt count on another force being there while we were

3646048 listen were about to head back to our encampment its a place filled with our kind and i want you to come with us
3646049 alright ill come along theres nothing left for me here anymore
3646050 i was able to free all of our comrades during the raid but goto maki still hasnt woken up

3646052 it feels like we stepped into some sort of futuristic time zone doesnt it commander
3646053 i have you to thank for saving my life i thought for sure i was a goner in that cell
3646054 so did i after that jet crashed into the store house we were in
3646055 please try to remember do you know what happened to it
3646056 im sorry but you have no idea how important that watch was it belonged to ishibashi he gave it to me for safekeeping he he might not even know that im still alive if i left it behind
3646057 oh dear i see why you were so worried then
3646058 i said id explain later and now that were all here ill tell you
3646059 ayaka and i have been keeping in constant contact all throughout the formation of the s m a t forces she had told me about all the great things you girls have done for us mutants particularly how you were coming close to changing the whole stereotype of how all mutants are dangerous and had won over the trust of many people unfortunately i did not have that courage when i discovered my own mutant abilities a couple of years ago i was so afraid of what others might think of my new abilities that i left h p and headed to america under the whole pretense that i was going there to study music however i went there just to isolate myself so i could have time to come to terms with what i was ayaka and i kept in contact with each other the whole time though it was a very big surprise to find out how many of you were mutants just like me if i had known i might not have left at that time i thought i was the only mutant monster in the whole world a couple of days ago i got an urgent message from ayaka which told me about the whole situation between you and japans police and military upon hearing the news i immediately departed for japan on my personal jet during the flight i was watching the news as well and heard of the order to arrest all h p girls since i used to be one i knew that it was far too dangerous to actually land in japan so i had my crew set down on a small island about 100 km east of japan at that point i immediately began construction on this island thanks to the help of my army of robot inventions who worked tirelessly 24 hours a day weve completed this new extremely high tech headquarters for you and your s m a t forces
3646060 hmm id say about 1 000 give or take a couple hundred
3646061 and just how did you come to have that many
3646062 except my abilities are far more advanced i can create some of the most complex inventions with mere thought alone here watch
3646063 wow i think thats quite possibly the coolest mutant ability i have ever seen
3646064 i have yet to find any limit to the type or size of invention i could create
3646065 but i do tend to get slight headaches after i create larger inventions with my mind
3646066 please try to remember do you know what happened to it
3646067 im sorry but you have no idea how important that watch was it belonged to ishibashi he gave it to me for safekeeping he he might not even know that im still alive if i left it behind
3646068 oh dear i see why you were so worried then
3646069 hmm id say about 1 000 give or take a couple hundred
3646070 except my abilities are far more advanced i can create some of the most complex inventions with mere thought alone sugoi
3646071 wow i think thats quite possibly the coolest mutant ability i have ever seen
3646072 of course follow me thats most likely where everyone else is
3646073 the situation changed over the last couple weeks with obviously the impact of statements that came out of melbourne in regard to a couple of banks and their respective positions
3646074 some impact internationally on the reputation of australian banks and the ability to access international funding markets
3646075 obviously in undertaking an acquisition of this type it was a requirement to raise significant funds for the book that we would be taking over from rbs
3646076 and we came to a conclusion as at tuesday given where markets are that it would be prudent at this point not to go any further with the due diligence process that we were already involved with
3646077 we will look at any opportunity at any given time but at this stage theres nothing specific that i can talk to at this point
3646078 in terms of the number of students who are ready this year compared to last we are talking about genuine progress
3646079 more students are reaching at least a minimum level of readiness for college credit courses were keeping a lot of kids from having to take remedial level courses that translates to millions of dollars that are being saved at the state level
3646080 we have a more heterogeneous population of test takers so were including those kids who werent considering college or arent considering college
3646081 now if somebody wants to sue us they have an option to sue but im fairly certain that a judge will see it the way the way the citizens see it here
3646082 the citizens deserve peace that some infringement on constitutional rights is ok and we have not violated anything as far as the constitution
3646083 weve had people call us expressing concern for their children
3646084 they had to sleep on the floor because of stray bullets
3646085 the residents of these high crime areas are already victims
3646086 theyre victims of what are happening in the neighborhoods theyre victims of fear but for them to be subject to unlawful stops and questioning that is not going to ultimately going to help this situation
3646087 as far as im concerned at 3 oclock in the morning nobody has any business being on the street except the law
3646088 anyone out at 3 oclock shouldnt be out on the street unless youre going to the hospital
3646089 id be very surprised if this hasnt arrived in the uk by 2009
3646090 you watch him do his work and his work is good his preparation is good
3646091 at times hes a little overanxious and at times hes run into bad luck its been a tough couple of months for him i think hes better than what hes produced we all believe that
3646092 were going to try to put our best lineup on the field every day
3646093 in seguito ai recentissimi eventi abbiamo ha potuto constatare la poca seriet della nuova cordata composta da ospedaletti sanremo carlins boys ponente calcio matuziana e dulcis in fundo lusd sanremese 1904 ovvero la squadra di carlo barill
3646094 a nostro avviso proseguono non concepibile autoproclamarsi il nuovo gruppo che riporter il calcio cittadino ad alti livelli ed allo stesso tempo includere nel progetto di rinascita una delle persone che ha maggiormente contribuito a far radiare la vecchia e gloriosa us sanremese calcio 1904 pertanto teniamo a ribadire ed a far sapere agli artefici di questo accordo che una societ con al suo interno il signor carlo barill non verr mai riconosciuta dai noi ultras del gruppo matutia 1904 come la nuova sanremese
3646095 linstabilit e la debolezza delle istituzioni mauritane possono favorire i terroristi
3646096 anche se difficile stabilire quale sia la reale forza del gruppo non c dubbio che proveranno a sfruttare la situazione soprattutto a livello mediatico

3646158 tu non mi capisci non sei me o lui e se non sai allora non permetterti di giudicare
3646159 e colpa mia s anche lui ha le sue colpe ma sono ben poca cosa in confronto a quello che ho fatto io
3646160 mi aveva promesso che saremmo rimati insieme per sempre bugiardo

3646163 jed did a nice job in the limited plays that he had offensively but also on special teams
3646164 that fullback position youve got to produce on special teams or youre going to struggle to make it there collins did the best job of the other guys on the special teams unit
3646165 there are 11 starters on offense and 11 starters on defense if you aint one of them you better be good at special teams
3646166 special teams keeps you around and that gives you a chance to make plays in other ways
3646167 you can get in the rotation and get a chance to make plays on offense or defense because of what you do on special teams because if you dont make it on special teams you definitely wont get a chance to make it on offense or defense
3646168 weve got guys that have got to be major contributors on special teams
3646169 that is a major area of emphasis for us just making sure that we have the guys out there that can provide us the best chance of success
3646170 if you arent a starter you really have to make a living as a special teams player
3646171 there are a lot of good position players out there who cant play special teams who dont end up making it
3646172 special teams is an important part of the game its a third of it and a lot of valuable field position can be determined by it an older guy like myself i try to preach it to the younger guys

3646179 so do you think in this planet is there anyone who can defeat you and if so who is it
3646180 to be at the top of so many great athletes
3646181 but it wasnt easy to put that race behind me
3646182 all the emotion that went into that relay i had friends texting me all afternoon saying i cant sleep im still fired up about that race and im not even out there

3646188 shes a beautiful beautiful beautiful person in a very ugly position and i really feel for her
3646189 i think that i really have never known someone so insistent upon integrity and honesty and openness
3646190 but someone who has an affair with a married man you say has integrity and honesty
3646191 i think she thought that he had quite a bit of integrity and i think that that appealed to her about him sometimes we make mistakes sometimes we pick people to fall in love with that maybe arent the greatest choice at the time i cant judge her in that i cant fault her in that
3646192 a very keenly intellectually engaged woman shes very insistent upon rigorous dialogue
3646193 we lost touch in about may or june of 06 right before she began work on the webisodes i think she was gearing up to really engage in the big piece of work that she was doing for him so her head was in a different space

3646195 le jugamos muy duro a uno de los grandes animadores del v leibol mundial como lo es estados unidos en algunos momentos pens que pod amos llegar a jugar cinco tiempos pero el equipo es joven y espero que salgan igual ante polonia
3646196 cuando terminen los juegos estaremos entre los 12 primeras del mundo y este ser uno de los pocos equipos que no tendr que ser renovado debido a su juventud ellas tienen mucho talento y lo que necesitan es jugar para perfeccionarse
3646197 somos un equipo joven y estamos subiendo poco a poco en cuatro a os podemos pelear porque vamos a estar con m s fogueo y compentencia much simo m s preparadas
3646198 es mi mejor tiempo y por eso estoy contento pero obviamente es frustrante porque no voy a estar en la final
3646199 no voy a dejar que me deprima mucho porque tengo una batalla mucho m s importante en unas dos semanas
3646200 estoy muy contento por haber venido y hacer esto ha sido una experiencia incre ble es todo lo que pude haber deseado y ahora tengo que seguir con mi vida
3646201 que conf en en mi la medalla va para dominicana no importa el color
3646202 no le temo a nadie ni siquiera al chino zou shiming que es campe n mundial
3646203 la velocidad para tirar los golpes e imponer el respeto en el ring donde ninguna pelea es f cil
3646204 entren muy duro e hice muchos sacrificios pero el equipo esta muy bien con mucha confianza y repito que conf en en mi y en nosotros que regresamos de aqu con medalla
3646205 i am flattered by celtics interest they are one of the biggest teams in the world and their fans are the best in the world
3646206 but newcastle have very good fans and i am flattered by their interest also but we have to wait it does not depend on me
3646207 there is so much that needs to be done for a transfer but a move to the united kingdom is the one i want to move my career forward
3646208 podemos tener una oportunidad de ganar este partido sobre cien o sobre mil pero vamos a ver si es sta si tengo una oportunidad sobre mil voy a intentar que sea sta no voy a conjeturar sobre el partido ni sobre el resultado porque ser a infiel a mis jugadoras y a mi equipo
3646209 son una primera potencia pero en la cancha hay cinco contra cinco no veinte contra cinco as que eso hay que demostrarlo en la cancha vamos a salir a por todas
3646210 no juega partidos amistosos ni tira ning n partido antes de jugarlo
3646211 en pek n todo va muy bien no ha habido incidentes importantes en algunas provincias ha habido ciertos incidentes y hemos desplegado fuerzas en esas regiones no se han cambiado las condiciones de seguridad es una pr ctica rutinaria y estamos usando el mismo personal que en otros juegos
3646212 no estoy preocupado xinjiang es parte de china y el estado no puede permitir este tipo de separaci n pero quieren usar los juegos ol mpicos para ampliar su influencia
3646213 la polic a ya realiz las pesquisas y hemos invitado al fbi y a la embajada de estados unidos para que se participen en la investigaci n lamentamos profundamente lo ocurrido desde el punto de vista de la seguridad fue un caso delictivo aislado y no creemos que esto vaya a empa ar los juegos

3646219 newspapers in pakistan im afraid dream up things then start writing about them theres no such thing
3646220 i believe there are several compelling reasons why nsps proposed new fuel figure should be revised nspis demonstrated track record of over forecasting fuel costs to its favour the fuel forecast understates coal generation compared to what could be expected on a normalized basis
3646221 over recovered approximately 230 million from its customers for fuel expense
3646222 which should have meant that nspi would have under recovered its fuel expense
3646223 whether this habitual over estimation is intentional or simply inherent in nspis forecasting process is immaterial the fact is that it happens and so must be accounted for in the ratemaking exercise
3646224 generally whenever the buskers festival is in town the hotels are busy it is a great festival for halifax
3646225 when you get outside the city you start to see the effects of the downturn of the american market
3646226 in my hotel in particular u s visitors are down about 11 per cent from last year year to date
3646227 you cant get an suv in halifax for weeks ive tried
3646228 he had so many things wrong he stopped eating he just wanted to lay there
3646229 the area i live in is totally infested with raccoons
3646230 they run along the fences theyre in the garbage theyre in your yard they try to dig up plants
3646231 the most common cause is wildlife urinating and getting into stagnant water and then a dog coming along and drinking that water
3646232 it can actually go in and affect the liver and kidney
3646233 what we found is that the liver enzymes were right off the scale
3646234 you have to look at the risk factor of your own dog and decide whether you want to vaccinate or not or keep the animal on a leash so you know what theyre getting into
3646235 these are not tame animals theyre not supposed to be here in the numbers that they are
3646236 what a staff person would do is offer advice depending upon the information that they receive
3646237 our first advice always is to try to make it as easy as possible for animals and humans to co habitat
3646238 if they really want the animal removed then people have the choice of trapping the animals themselves
3646239 theyre certified to catch the animals and they charge a fee
3646240 we make those names available if people are looking for someone to do that
3646241 even if it is a confirmed diagnosis of leptospirosis the sources of that are numerous
3646242 it was one of many factors that contributed to better results
3646243 its not all layoffs its also just reconfiguring when people work and what time they work
3646244 people werent visiting our casino it didnt matter how few or how many staff we had the casino property itself was too large
3646245 we had to downsize the halifax facility physically and therefore obviously staff would lose their jobs because we werent having as many positions open
3646246 theres an anti gaming sentiment thats been promoted for a number of years
3646247 in the absence of other assurances to secure adequate emergency response coverage for nova scotians in the event of a work interruption or strike we see discussion of this topic as our right and perhaps even our obligation to the public
3646248 you cannot go forward in the health industry without spending a dime
3646249 i believe in this round of negotiations more so than any other round the paramedics of this province are greatly united in standing together for what theyve been trying to get since 1997
3646250 the reality is that were faced with a slowdown and right now were seeing the commodity trade that whole momentum unravel quickly
3646251 its conceivable that the surviving u s financials because i do think there will be continued mayhem in that space and mergers and so on its conceivable that you will see not writedowns but writeups in the next year
3646252 our view is right now that were definitely seeing a slowdown but the u s is continuing its rehabilitation and china will slow but not fall into recession and then europe and japan thats a different story theres a more pronounced slowdown there
3646253 if anything i said can be interpreted as sexist i unequivocally and wholeheartedly apologize and withdraw my comments
3646254 i have always been a strong supporter of women in politics and want to encourage not hinder their participation in the public sphere
3646255 if they wanted to take me out i would think youd get someone whos looking forward to building a political career not somebody whos at the age where hes considering retirement
3646256 seeing the reaction of people today it would seem my comments were reflecting on the larger group or women in general and that was not the intention of my comment so i thought the only way to put it to bed was to issue an apology and retraction
3646257 when you live in a fish bowl you gotta watch how you swim
3646258 stephane dion must show that these comments are not acceptable in the political process and immediately reprimand his caucus members
3646259 its upsetting and ridiculous to hear this from an elected official
3646260 it should never have happened in the first place there has to be a direct apology to marjory lebreton and i just think its an assault on those who are running and those who would think about running
3646261 why didnt rona ambrose speak out when peter mackay called belinda stronach a dog
3646262 i think its kind of short sighted on her part or anyone elses to insist that thibault be reprimanded
3646263 if youre 50 or over and have a perfect driving record come join us and make sure you dont get sucked into subsidizing younger drivers like our parents had to do
3646264 we analysed the soccer facilities and playgrounds in the area and said we really dont need this
3646265 if its not rezoned residential it will be redeveloped as institutional and thats not very great
3646266 keep this land and give this developer a piece of land downtown

3646290 the bombardment of questions continued into the evening several times i asked in vain for my lawyer
3646291 i wanted to go to the toilet the toilet and tap were a step up
3646292 a male police officer helped me onto the pot after i had pulled down my pants and then helped me back into the wheelchair after i had pulled up my pants again it was extremely humiliating
3646293 at one stage a prisoner who was cleaning the floor said to another prisoner that he was awaiting trial for hijacking a bakkie
3646294 it was almost lunch time the magistrate said i had to go to court in keimoes they locked me up in the court room without any food until after lunch
3646295 di era 1960 dan 1970 an tak ada seorang pun dari luar inggris yang memilih bermain di liga utama inggris utamanya karena liga inggris sangat membutuhkan kekuatan fisik
3646296 bahkan di ruangan ini saya bisa melihat beberapa fans memakai kaos liverpool klub klub inggris bahkan punya penggemar di italia meski di sana ada ac milan inter milan dan juventus
3646297 rafael benitez adalah manajer hebat dan dia bisa melaksanakan tugasnya dengan baik di tengah pemain pemain top seperti keane dan fernando torres anda butuh penyerang bagus yang dapat membuka peluang dan mencetak gol tetapi mu dan chelsea punya pilihan yang lebih baik

3646304 we congratulate michael on this momentous achievement and wish him the best as he continues his march towards olympic history
3646305 on the podium i kept tearing up thinking back at it im almost at a loss for words im just really pumped about the relay we talked about breaking seven minutes and we did it
3646306 from now on its just a downward slope the end is close i love it
3646307 my goggles pretty much filled up with water it just kept getting worse and worse through the race and i was having trouble seeing the walls to be honest but its fine i wanted to go 1 51 or better but for the circumstances i guess its not too bad
3646308 i would have liked to medal but i got my first personal best of the meet and i think thats a good effort
3646309 i cant be upset with that and im just moving onto the next heat
3646310 its a big surprise for me and its my third medal at beijing
3646311 now ive got one of each color so im happy its a new event to me im still trying to figure out my strategies but im so pleased and really happy with the bronze back in april i didnt have any event that day so i just picked it up for something to do
3646312 she swam many many events and many unusual doubles but with the 200 free and 200 im shed be tired id be tired too if i had more events
3646313 it was an exciting game we need that kind of game the way everybody kind of relaxed loosened up weve got two more months to decide where were going to be at the end of the season so thats the kind of game that puts you in the mood and gets you going all the way
3646314 even more than that was to see the last out
3646315 thats an interesting night at some point youre thinking about going for a field goal
3646316 that had a chance to be a really frustrating night and in the end the musics playing and we won thats what we set out to do thats not exactly how we drew it up
3646317 youve just got to play it out because theres no time youve just got to play the outs till you get the 27th out
3646318 i also felt the emotion of the boos today too
3646319 the roller coaster ride in bostons always fun luckily we got the cheers at the end

3646322 in terms of the number of students who are ready this year compared to last we are talking about genuine progress
3646323 more students are reaching at least a minimum level of readiness for college credit courses were keeping a lot of kids from having to take remedial level courses that translates to millions of dollars that are being saved at the state level
3646324 we have a more heterogeneous population of test takers so were including those kids who werent considering college or arent considering college

3646334 i think everyone is wearing the suit now so were on kind of a level playing field
3646335 technology in all sports keep advancing and i think they will as technology grows i think sports kind of have to keep up with that technology its a great suit i love it
3646336 hopefully our sport stays that way certainly no one wants to lose to a suit we swim the race against the athletes next to us not the technology
3646337 personally i dont have any positive test to back it up but yes i think doping exists
3646338 the sport has become entertainment and its taken on the morals of entertainment we rely on an inadequate doping agency for the proof youre innocent until proven guilty the key word being proven it can be very depressing for clean athletes

3646341 we need an environmentally literate public in order to complete our mission
3646342 if were having this much trouble with climate change it may because we dont really understand climate
3646343 while i am supportive of encouraging climate change education curriculum i have consistently vetoed legislation that has attempted to mandate specific details or events into areas of instruction
3646344 i continue to believe that the state should refrain from being overly prescriptive in specific school curriculum beyond establishing rigorous academic standards and frameworks
3646345 it seems to me that the absence of one of the most compelling environmental issues of our time somehow suggests that these items were superior to those that were not mentioned
3646346 in a sense were doing it but were doing it from a broader scope
3646347 we should be teaching the fundamental dynamics of climate not necessarily this specific topic
3646348 the teacher would have to pull all those together if they wanted to teach a few lessons about climate
3646349 to understand and accept climate change means dealing with a very complex set of issues that involves politics and economics and religion
3646350 thats why it has to be such a deep approach to education it cant be a five minute film
3646351 for him to mandate teaching climate change is saying everybodys got to change
3646352 and there are some parts of the country that are not interested in teaching about climate change
3646353 youve been hearing more and more about global warming but nobody seems to agree not even the scientists who study it
3646354 is the world really in danger from human caused increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide or are the environmentalists a bunch of chicken littles
3646355 on the one hand a warmer globe will cause sea levels to rise threatening coastal communities
3646356 on the other hand greater warmth will make it easier and cheaper to grow crops and avoid high heating bills
3646357 the type of web site that you build with movable type doesnt have to look like a classic two or three column blog
3646358 it can be structured to look like any web site you see surfing the web web publishing is moving from a heavily process driven activity to being something more decentralized something more inclusive of community and being able to build web sites in a more rapid and agile fashion we really view movable type as part of sea change in web content management toward a social publishing direction
3646359 i cant understand what hes been rested for because hes not in the one day set up and the next test match is in about five months time
3646360 if stephen had said he wanted to rest obviously thats fine
3646361 he has now had two days off because he didnt bowl yesterday or today
3646362 going straight from yesterday to a game today might have been asking a bit much
3646363 the first job with steve was really to decide in the short term what was best for him
3646364 durham were starting a game on tuesday to be fair to him i spoke to steve on sunday after we came off the field and he was emotionally and physically drained
3646365 hed put a lot into the test match hed waited a long time for his comeback game and he did a fantastic job
3646366 his first job is to have a bit of a break recharge the batteries and then go back to durham
3646367 but we expect that decision to be based entirely on what is good for the players and good for england
3646368 i would understand it a bit better if there was a reason behind it but i cant see why
3646369 if theyd gone out and celebrated after winning the test its a bit tough on the guy to come and play he must enjoy his win im quite happy with that
3646370 he told me before he went on the field at the oval that he wanted to play here because the england game was over on the monday
3646371 just before day four we got a call from the ecb to say he would not be available because with the effort he has put in he is knackered which is fine
3646372 i appreciated harmys commitment he said he really wanted to play
3646373 he knows now what is best for him and surely they england should know by now that the only way he gets up to his standards bowling wise is to bowl
3646374 from our own point of view we have a good chance to win the championship and he has been a major factor in getting us to this position
3646375 we would obviously like him to be available if he is fit and ready to go

3646380 however our study shows that the crucial feature is being outdoors irrespective of the activity you are doing
3646381 our results show that the protective effect of time spent outdoors persists even if a child is doing a lot of near work such as reading and studying
3646382 promoting outdoor activity to parents and families and including more outdoor pursuits in school curricula could be an important public health measure to avoid the development of myopia
3646383 we are confident that every senator and the liberal opposition will want to look closely at the data from the tax office

3646385 other industry figures show a decrease of over a million litres of spirits combining the decrease in alcopops with the small increase in straight spirits a decline overall of 1 1 million litres of pure alcohol consumed

3646396 ultimately that decision is made by the attorney general of the united states
3646397 the reason weve been appointed in this case is it carries a potential death sentence it doesnt mean its going to be a death penalty case one of our functions will be to try to marshal reasons to the government why the death penalty shouldnt become an issue
3646398 the reason im sure the federal defenders appointed attorneys with death penalty expertise is that they believe its likely that the feds will in fact seek the death penalty in the case when charges are ultimately filed
3646399 and so its really important that the criminal defendants have attorneys with competence in death penalty cases because they are very difficult they encompass a whole range of issues that are not present in cases in which the death penalty is not at issue
3646400 instead of returning those paintings he decided to keep them he wanted to cash in on them
3646401 he took the view that a finders fee was the usual and standard practice
3646402 i loved those paintings for all those years and they were gone
3646403 we feel it is a reneg on the governors promise
3646404 he came into office pledging to put 1 000 police on the street this is going to take 1 000 police off the street we think that public safety will suffer in the long run
3646405 the governor was clearly elected on a mandate for change and this is real change this is the type of reform that the public have been clamoring for
3646406 if 49 other states can strike a balance between public safety and saving money we can too
3646407 the stars in a way seem to be lining up for the cape as it relates to wastewater
3646408 we expect work to restart on the mep very quickly within a week or two

3646410 two elements we needed to make it a very good week for cape cod
3646411 rochester is a town that cares about its environment and we want to restore the treescape that was originally here
3646412 the entire angel flight world is saddened and surprised and shocked that this is happening all at once
3646413 is there any commonality its just so strange to have this happen after such a long history
3646414 the plane just did a nose dive straight down to the pavement
3646415 there was a lot of smoke thick black smoke everybody was pretty much horrified
3646416 for them to decide there shouldnt be a citizens advisory committee
3646417 the u s senate is one of our forefathers most brilliant democratic inventions
3646418 i believe it is critical to have a place where citizens can go to learn first hand about the senates important roles in our system of government
3646419 after a couple meetings i think well be able to pull that off by the end of the year
3646420 and thats not a credit to me thats a credit to his life people are so receptive to doing something in his name after hes done so much to help other people
3646421 this will be like a presidential library but even better in that it covers a longer era
3646422 and while presidents can do things by fiat senators do it by creating alliances and a team approach both scholars and our students will be able to learn about that process have access to the educational facilities there and the world class speakers who will be attracted there
3646423 massachusetts has an opportunity and an obligation to show the nation how to responsibly manage development in the states coastal waters preserving national resources and balancing new and traditional uses of the ocean

3646426 at the start of the season which is april we did see an impact for the months of april and may what we found was instead of coming up ahead of time people were trying to plan more but now this summer since june our number of reservations is about the same as last year
3646427 the continuing rise in gas and oil prices and their subsequent effect on the transportation and travel plans of americans has affected our business like many other businesses

3646434 it would protect the u s from supply shocks elsewhere and its probably the best stimulus we could come up with
3646435 were not talking about alternatives because we both support alternatives
3646436 youre talking about a million barrels day coming online the additional supply is a big deal
3646437 no one knows what impact its going to have 10 years down the road but were still going to need more oil and gas

3646456 we are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population

3646467 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3646468 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3646469 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3646470 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3646471 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3646472 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3646473 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3646474 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3646475 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3646476 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3646477 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3646478 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3646479 dengan jumlah penduduk sebanyak 163 juta orang dan dengan daya dukung lingkungan yang rusak maka secara terukur kekurangan air benar benar akan terjadi
3646480 kerusakan yang paling banyak terjadi terdapat di wilayah jawa barat dimana reboisasinya kurang berhasil sehingga kerusakan daerah aliran sungainya tidak dapat dihindari
3646481 pekerjaan rumah saat ini adalah melakukan reboisasi di hulu memperluas tangkapan air pembuatan sumur resapan pengelolaan limbah yang berakhir pada pengendalian baku mutu air
3646482 perbedaan tata ruang ini telah merusak lingkungan secara langsung sehingga seluruh tangkapan airnya berkurang akibat dialih fungsikan lahannya
3646483 perda penataan ruang dengan pp penataan ruang harus complementary atau saling melengkapi karena alasan tersebut sebelum suatu aturan tata ruang diperdakan harus dikonsultasikan kepada tingkatan administrasi yang lebih tinggi misalnya perda penataan ruang kabupaten kota harus dikonsultasikan ke provinsi
3646484 dalam rtrwn contohnya disebutkan mengenai kawasan lindung dan kawasan budidaya nah dalam kawasan budidaya tersebut antara lain mengatur kawasan strategis nasional dan kawasan perekonomian daerah andalan seperti itu yang diatur dalam rtrwn
3646485 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3646486 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3646487 anecdotally theres a lot of foreclosed properties coming to the market this is telling us any bottoming in the housing market will be very long and drawn out
3646488 a very painful failure and a real setback for the global economy when we really needed some good news
3646489 at a time when food and fuel prices are high and the global economic outlook is uncertain
3646490 a decent trade deal could have given them the poor a chance to prevent worsening poverty
3646491 the us is looking at enhancing its commercial interests whereas i am looking at protecting the livelihood of farmers
3646492 would you avoid a movie if you knew it contained sexually explicit material
3646493 when was the last time you viewed an adult movie
3646494 you will be asked to view depictions of sexual acts of all varieties vaginal anal oral sex sex with multiple partners ejaculation on the faces of women do you think you could do that
3646495 i viewed as many as four or five in the early 90s
3646496 because its so totally against any belief of mine that people can buy this stuff and watch it
3646497 i dont have anything against pornography and i cant say i would be able to follow your instructions
3646498 that if we excused everyone that felt that this stuff made them uncomfortable we couldnt get an accurate cross section of the community
3646499 it doesnt do any good to say youre sorry after youve already asked the question
3646500 you have both tried to indoctrinate these jurors and you need to stop doing that and start asking questions
3646501 but ive never seen anything like this and ive been practicing criminal law since 1968
3646502 this is totally typical for anyone whos ever had one of these cases
3646503 usually it takes two or three days and ive had one take as long as 38 days i think both sides agree this is the way it should happen
3646504 conducting a gigantic experiment with nature and the whole of humanity which has gone seriously wrong
3646505 we will end up with millions of small farmers all over the world being driven off their land into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness
3646506 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand
3646507 and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
3646508 huge salinisation problems i have been there seen it some of the excessive approaches to modern argriculture
3646509 genetic modification takes mankind into realms that belong to god and to god alone

3646523 it is also perhaps incumbent on the milf that a member of theirs has committed a criminal act to make him own up to it it also reflects on their credibility as an organization

3646532 next we launched out on a course of vigorous action the first step of which is a personal housecleaning which many of us had never attempted though
3646533 for practicing aas remaining eleven steps means the adoption of attitudes and actions that almost no alcoholic who is still drinking can dream of taking who wishes to be rigorously honest and tolerant who wants to confess his faults to another and make restitution for harm done who cares anything about a higher power let alone meditation and prayer who wants to sacrifice time and energy in trying to carry aas message to the next sufferer no the average alcoholic self centered in the extreme doesnt care for this prospect unless he has to do these things in order to stay alive himself
3646534 the irish index is heavily weighted on financial stocks compared with stock markets globally and as a result of the credit crunch they have been hard hit
3646535 irish financials have been badly hit over the last 18 months even more so than their european equivalents there really has been no good news for irish investors over the last 12 to 18 months
3646536 i have taken the decision to end the operation to force georgian authorities into peace
3646537 the purpose of the operation has been achieved the security of our peacekeeping forces and the civilian population has been restored
3646538 i dont think russia will feel like talking with mr saakashvili after what he did to our citizens
3646539 now we have to see whether the russians are not only stopping military operations but redeploying and withdrawing the troops that have been brought into georgia on august 6 and accept international monitoring of the ceasefire agreement
3646540 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people
3646541 the issue now is to determine what amount of the gas can be recovered
3646542 q3 performance was well ahead of last years levels and in line with the groups expectations this has been achieved despite significant sterling weakness year on year
3646543 he told us there was a problem that we needed to fix it so we did
3646544 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
3646545 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3646546 lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in terms of voice yang peiyi is perfect each member of our team agreed
3646547 there is an urgent need for research to identify the reasons why so many of our young people with their life opportunities ahead of them take their own lives
3646548 it is important that the reasons why this is happening are identified and understood so that society may respond appropriately
3646549 preventative responses to suicide need to be embedded into a wide range of areas of societal policy that include education criminal justice and health the detail of the programme to do this is set out in the report reach out the national strategy for action on suicide prevention 2005 2014
3646550 resources must be in place so that the recommendations in this report are introduced and in strict accordance to the time scale set out in the document
3646551 all deaths are tragic but it is a fact that more people die by suicide than on our roads
3646552 we need to have the best possible university and third level institutions in the world certainly in europe
3646553 people voted for the pds based on a number of things and one of those was our strong commitment not to reintroduce third level fees
3646554 we have a party policy and ms harney is our only representative at cabinet and one would expect she would espouse the party line
3646555 the impression i got is that she is not ruling anything in or out
3646556 but i oppose any blunt instrument and believe the government will need to be more innovative and creative in coming up with a solution
3646557 i would regard it as a retrograde step and i would think not too many people would think its the right way to go
3646558 fianna f il would not go back to middle income families about reintroducing fees absolutely not but there needs to be a debate about the funding of third level and im very open to that debate
3646559 im also open to the idea that many people in ireland are calling for it and i dont know if it has been a vehicle for equity that it was meant to be
3646560 represent the final abandonment by fianna f il of any pretence of a commitment to the principle of equal citizenship
3646561 we and the mdc headed by mutambara have signed the agreement tsvangirai did not sign the agreement because he is basically trying to take us back to renegotiate issues that we had already agreed on
3646562 we are proceeding and the president mugabe is going to form a government of national unity including members of the opposition
3646563 the talks have not collapsed it is just a time out
3646564 the president has said they have not collapsed and that is the position
3646565 since their formation the zimbabwe defence forces have remained steadfast in defending our national sovereignty territorial integrity and interests as well as our hard won independence
3646566 these sterling achievements have overcome numerous concerted efforts from some sections of the international community zimbabwes crisis intensified after mugabes re election in a june 27 presidential run off which was widely condemned as a sham
3646567 he is an experienced player and he still has a lot to give to the team
3646568 he said to me that it was as if he was the only one who made mistakes i said to him that its possible you didnt play well but you are a national player and a national player must be able to accept criticism if you cant accept criticism you cant play football in 10 years time i am sure he will ask himself why did i not come back and of course he is a loss because we need all the players with an injury here or a red card there it is important you have cover
3646569 by being patient i have achieved many results in my career
3646570 when he is convinced and we are convinced that he is ready to come back he will come back but we cannot keep saying please come back please come back he must tell us at the same time i cannot exclude anyone the team must understand that its not my team or your team its ireland the players must understand that they must have pride
3646571 but then you stop and realise that he is still a young man he has indicated that he may come back in the future and as i have said before my door remains open we will speak to him again
3646572 he had an achilles problem in may but we said that we would continue to watch him this does not mean that he is ruled out for the games in september but as much as possible im trying to keep together the players we had in portugal but i am not forgetting anyone i know lee carsley well i know his experience and what he can do
3646573 with the new situation and the new tactics it is important that we create a strong team spirit
3646574 the governments recent decision to introduce significant reform of second level maths is welcome but its important that maths teachers get adequate professional support to deliver the programme
3646575 fianna f il has failed to meet the challenges posed by falling participation rates and achievement in maths and the sciences
3646576 some of the lads are giving out though as drink is being spilt and glasses knocked over when the dancing is going on
3646577 recently i met a fellow on the street at half seven in the morning and he was p ed out of his brain he said he was coming from the shebeen
3646578 i dispute that its a problem its a crisis but its not a humanitarian crisis
3646579 the refugees are afraid to return to their homes the fighting is still fresh i their minds
3646580 the areas have been cleared of troops under ameril umbra kato only the milf who are native to the area were left
3646581 by the looks of it they cannot withstand the pressure they cant withstand the beating theyre black and blue theyre escaping
3646582 it was the militia that started the fighting not the milf
3646583 addressing the concerns of the displaced remains our top priority
3646584 we need food we need clean water we cant bear the hardship of being evicted from our homes we need to live normal lives again
3646585 me my wife and four young children stay there waiting for food assistance but we cannot be in this situation for long
3646586 it was so cold at night and so hot at daytime this is how miserable our life has become because of the fighting
3646587 there is no way we can give up on the peace process
3646588 horrendous act of aggression by russia against a friendly democratic neighbour

3646799 i was shocked because i figured after i cleared waivers a couple weeks ago nobody wanted me
3646800 its going to take some adjustments i was throwing my blue indians socks in a box and a guy said they wear red socks over there
3646801 this trade is more about clearing room to give some of our other players an opportunity giving paul a chance with a contender and providing us some payroll relief
3646802 it just seemed like the right time to add this kind of stabilizer
3646803 you never want to get caught short on starting pitching in august and september because theres very little you can do about it
3646804 was an opportunity without dipping into our farm system to add a veteran starter we can trust
3646805 everything has been done out in the open i have a reputation i do not want the fans of cleveland or honest caring people to think that i cheated
3646806 i wasnt a red sox fan this offseason put it that way
3646807 it will take a quick adjustment but im eager to play for terry francona and with a talented team with a chance to win it all

3646820 it was the most pitches i ve thrown i felt pretty good life on the ball and good movement
3646821 when youre against the wall you can either fall down or come out fighting today we did the latter
3646822 its been a tough trip so to find a way to win a game is a big deal
3646823 well see if we get up tomorrow and make something of it if we come out and play flat dont have any energy and lose the series then it really didnt do us any good
3646824 i made a mistake the ball caught too much of the plate
3646825 we won thats the bottom line thats what its all about and thats why were here
3646826 you watch him do his work and his work is good his preparation is good

3646832 my partner and my son had to go to her mothers house theres no way you could bring a child into that
3646833 any successful coach has to have great communication skills i noticed from the first handshake that we were able to communicate whether we were talking about the technical part of the game or about how to build a consistent contending team we had a lot of the same thought processes i think hes going to do an outstanding job with our young players and he will communicate well with veterans too
3646834 but the bottom line is that if youre a good coach youre going to have success anywhere
3646835 there were a lot of fantastic hockey minds who came in to share their thoughts
3646836 i thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to meet them and talk hockey it was a rigorous process and scott really excelled scott gordon is the right coach for this team
3646837 i have no doubt that scott being a former goalie will know how to address that part of our team
3646838 hes adamant about playing a tight defensive system hes going to make a difference starting with our defensive zone the neutral zone forecheck will be different too its going to be a great fit for our players
3646839 seeing how it worked out it was still a bit too bright compared to the actual fireworks

3646855 weve had some tough moments with injuries but we have the team we can do it and were going to do it

3646860 i told him he could not continue to pitch like this or he was not going to pitch
3646861 i dont think it can hurt its good to have someone who is part of the goalies union ive heard great things about him
3646862 as far as systems go my job is to stop the hockey puck
3646863 but as a goalie you do get the opportunity to see things in front of you im sure hes going to institute a system that fits our team

3646874 inserting new wording into our constitution that overtly upholds the rights of the child is not a frightening or revolutionary proposition it will make a difference in peoples lives
3646875 but that difference will be felt by children who otherwise might be in danger who might be forgotten or whose families might not be given the supports to nurture their childrens potential and build a decent future for their kids
3646876 since that statement the only thing that has changed is political will children remain on long waiting lists for critical services and decisions continue to be made about them and for them that do not take into account what is in their best interest
3646877 we need to learn from the mistakes of the past and create a new culture where children can be assured of full protection under the law where they will not end up as witnesses in cases where the defence of honest mistake is argued and where the courts have the support of the constitution in making decisions that respect a childs rights and promote their well being
3646878 in barnardos we consider the rights of the child and the rights of the family to be mutually supportive in our work with children we work closely with families to make them stronger more nurturing environments in which to rear their children

3646882 our results show that the protective effect of time spent outdoors persists even if a child is doing a lot of near work such as reading and studying
3646883 television watching and using computers appears to have little effect on the development of refractive errors our recently published comparison of age matched chinese children from sydney and singapore showed the same trend
3646884 the results of this study are consistent with an american study which found that outdoor sport was protective however our study shows that the crucial feature is being outdoors irrespective of the activity you are doing
3646885 all these people have probably never even seen me play but loves womens volleyball and they have probably heard the stories from their parents also i think there are texts about me in the schools
3646886 it is wonderful for us to see all the support she is getting and it is great to see a volleyball player win so much respect

3646888 it should come as no surprise that young women are more in favour of domestic democracy than the young men while also being more supportive of a womans right to have an abortion
3646889 apart from australia and japan my samples were small and confined to young middle class urbanites nevertheless this study is unusual because it covers so many nations and the comparisons offer some interesting food for thought
3646890 it is interesting to note that those in western countries tend to see sharing housework and role reversal as similar ideas whereas most of those from asian countries who are also supportive of sharing housework were quite opposed to role reversal
3646891 while this might indicate to some people that greater equality exists in the western countries another interpretation is that it demonstrates the greater commitment to the fathers bread winning role in the asian countries
3646892 while performing housework and childcare was seen as nothing short of emasculation for many of the young men in my study this does not prevent them from claiming their rights in relation to abortion decisions

3646912 if nothing is done over the next 10 years an increasing amount of performances recorded and released between 1957 and 1967 will lose protection once their performance fixed in a phonogram is no longer protected around 7000 performers in any of the big member states and a correspondingly smaller number in the smaller member states will lose all of their income that derives from contractual royalties and statutory remuneration claims from broadcasting and public communication of their performances in bars and discotheques
3646913 the social situation of performers is not very secure many european performers start their careers in their early 20s that means that when the current 50 year protection ends they will be in their 70s performers face an income gap at the end of their lifetimes

3646934 het was de rit van mijn leven hier droom ik al van sinds ik een kind was toen ik over de streep kwam heeft men mij gezegd dat ik de beste tijd had maar ik durfde niet meteen hopen op de gouden medaille
3646935 ik wou eerst nog op de laatste concurrente wachten ik wou het op het bord zien staan ik train veel op de piste waardoor ik de nodige macht heb op het dalende en het vlakke stuk waar het tegenwind was ik zei tegen mezelf het is nu of nooit de olympische spelen zijn maar een keer om de vier jaar
3646936 op het wereldkampioenschap van madrid 2005 ben ik beginnen denken aan het podium van de spelen ik was vorig jaar tweede en het was moeilijk om de regenboogtrui opnieuw af te staan maar dit was eigenlijk een geluk bij een ongeluk want zo werd ik verplicht om vele kleine details te bekijken ik ben in december naar hier gekomen om de klim te bekijken want het is geen tijdrit zoals we gewoon zijn om te rijden
3646937 vooral omdat het mijn beste match ooit was tegen haar ze heeft een heel goede worp en die heb ik kunnen blokkeren maar dan verlies ik met een golden score het is geen kwestie van fysiek want ik denk dat zij zelfs kapotter zat dan ik ik moet de beelden nog eens bekijken maar ik denk dat zij heeft overgenomen en zo heeft gescoord
3646938 voor hetzelfde geld had ik echter kunnen winnen iets voordien had ik haar in een armklem maar de scheidsrechter zei dat ik op haar kin aan het werken was terwijl ik enkel haar kraag vast had
3646939 ik had gedacht dat scapin wel door zou gaan want ze is heel sterk en heeft heel veel ervaring
3646940 ik heb haar kamp echter niet gezien maar ik denk dat ze verrast is geweest misschien was ze iets te laat geconcentreerd
3646941 ik ga nu even uitblazen maar het is absoluut niet de bedoeling om te stoppen
3646942 ik heb er absoluut nog zin in en ik voelde me hier eindelijk voor de eerste keer in twee jaar weer goed ik heb hard op mijn tanden moeten bijten om te staan waar ik nu sta dus ik ga er nu zeker niet de brui aan geven

3646955 they looked very happy together i remember the bride looked very young and pale and quite angelic
3646956 they didnt bring any friends as witnesses so the photographer had to stand in
3646957 i asked them each if they agreed to love and cherish each other and they said i do it was over in 15 minutes the bride changed out of her wedding dress right away then they left the groom wasnt dressed up at all

3646996 sadly but predictably the critics have stepped forward to once again cast a shadow over the achievements of the pupils and their teachers by pointing out that not all the results are in

3646998 a nightmare is much more intense than a bad dream it can arouse feelings of fear horror and distress

3647001 i would like to say that the worshippers at reading hindu temple are not in fear we are a community whose concern at the moment is for our pandits priests health
3647002 any concerns there were were addressed at the very first public meeting possible they explained that he first of all had a tb that was extremely low risk there was not going to be a mass screening because the risk was so low
3647003 the pandit is very much loved by all the community and that was what we saw reflected the views expressed were not an accurate reflection of what was going on

3647006 they dropped proceedings to pour all their energies into each other but madonna now feels they are stable enough to press ahead with the adoption again

3647010 i do think they could have waited a bit if they want a worldwide hit i have them all up here
3647011 i guess they are going for clean cut and boring when i do release mine and i am tempted to do it on the same day this would be the bigger hit
3647012 abu dhabi is an obvious choice for a boat show as it is the richest of the oil laden united arab emirates has a large expatriate population and is aiming to transform itself into a global tourist destination
3647013 diverse sports amp leisure pursuits are part of the active lifestyle residents enjoy in abu dhabi and the most recently announced 2009 formula 1 abu dhabi prix ferrari theme park and warner brothers theme park are all situated on the yas island a 2 500 hectare island development
3647014 we have received overwhelming support from abu dhabi as the host and from the marine industry in particular with regard to the timing of the show
3647015 with the emirates boat show international in abu dhabi we will be well on the way to providing the luxury marine industry in the middle east with a year round calendar of events that marine enthusiasts could look forward to
3647016 for us at knotika boat shows are not just about boats but also everything that goes with the marine lifestyle
3647017 people do not buy a boat just to own it they want to enjoy it to live the culture and that is what we are bringing to abu dhabi this is not simply a boat show it is a marine lifestyle exhibition where they will be able to see and buy the latest coolest and must have yachts and marine products
3647018 were waiting to find out but there are so many leaders in the team and whoever it is im convinced will do a great job for the country
3647019 there will be a lot on their shoulders but they will do a great job jt and rio are both great players they are both top central defenders and both would be equally deserving of the captains armband if they got it as would steven gerrard as would david beckham to be honest
3647020 my ambition is to play for my country and i think with aston villa i will have that possibility every player wants to play international football and that is my aim
3647021 this is the best league in the world and last year villa did very well they play very good football and had a fantastic season
3647022 so i am very happy to come here with the opportunity to play in the premier league we are also playing in europe this season so that will be good
3647023 we are going to build a team and its not possible for him to go to another club
3647024 valencia is a very big club with all the possibilities for him to achieve what he wants
3647025 there have been a lot of rumours flying around but i am not going anywhere and i dont anticipate going anywhere
3647026 there is a job to do here and i am looking forward to it
3647027 nothing whatsoever has changed in that respect and the football operation hasnt changed since i signed for the club nor has my relationship with garry cook and his team we get on really well and continue to speak on a daily basis
3647028 i am the guy that makes the decisions in relation to the football and they make the decisions in relation to the running of the club
3647029 et si on allait prendre lair tous les deux au bord de la mer
3647030 un succ s pour le pr sident sarkozy ndlr et pour leurope
3647031 ce qui a t constat moscou ce nest pas vraiment un accord auquel a contribu nicolas sarkozy cest simplement une situation de fait que la russie a impos par la force

3647035 la g orgie et dautres pays veulent rentrer dans lotan
3647036 thats a big deal right now when it costs you a paycheck to take your tractor
3647037 getting to the pull is where the big cost is
3647038 at this time of the season this will be my fourth pull normally id have been to eight
3647039 since the gas is so high i try to pull the closest one to me
3647040 theyre fun to walk around theyre easier to take care of
3647041 its hard to get them to do what you want them to do
3647042 if your pig is not cooperative its hard but its very easy if you know how to do it
3647043 i think pigs are the easiest project because you dont have to learn how to place your feet like for cows
3647044 theyre fun to take to the fair because you get a good feeling when youre showing it
3647045 you know how to take care of an animal taking responsibility for your animal doing your best to show it
3647046 you have to show you can make your pig go where you want it to go you want the judge to see everything
3647047 you have to communicate with your pig or it wont go very good
3647048 just do your best and listen to people who are older than you and try to get as much out of it as you can
3647049 when you win all your hard work paid off if you dont win you tried your best
3647050 its a lot of fun to get them and watch them grow
3647051 when you keep it at home its fun to take care of it and feed it and see it every day
3647052 he did it because he wanted to buy some stuff
3647053 johnathan you cant be everywhere all the time something like this was bound to happen sooner or later
3647054 you can try but youll fail just like the time when you tried to follow her on her first date i dont think you want to relive the incident like what went down on ventura boulevard
3647055 its not unreasonable to be worried about our daughter whos in the hospital on her damned prom night i remember my prom night it was a dull uneventful evening that was completely safe everyone locked in the monte vista high school gym no drugs no guns no ridiculous hip hop gangbangers with vendettas to resolve
3647056 look john im upset too and frankly it quite scares me that not only did our daughter get shot but it was paco who did it
3647057 no kidding woman how am i going to explain this to the ins when they come knocking at our door
3647058 well i still think that giving him that nra membership as a early graduation gift was a bit underthought
3647059 how the hell was i supposed to know that some gun vendor over in the valley would take his membership card as valid id over a government issued passport its not like its my fault
3647060 well sienna is going to be sad when she finds out if she doesnt already know it was him those two were like siblings
3647061 stop starting every sentence with well dammit newsflash wifey we have a daughter in the hospital a foreign exchange student who needs bail money and my nerves to be a little less shot
3647062 jesus theresa grow up sienna could be dying in there for all we know and were sitting here twiddling our thumbs im going in there
3647063 johnathan roland terfshire dont you dare doctor mirth told us to wait right here
3647064 doctor mirth the man performing surgery on our daughters perforated lung
3647065 i know who youre talking about but thats not his name
3647066 i beg to differ good sir when i got sienna here he told me his name after we pulled sienna from the subaru
3647067 well i was talking to a couple of the nurses at reception and they said it was mirse i even doule checked so i wouldnt get lost god knows theres enough floors in this hospital last thing i needed was to get lost in the 4th floor chapel whilst my daughter is dying from an accidental penicillin injection on the 12th
3647068 ok so maybe i heard it wrong it has been a rather trying evening wouldnt you say

3647078 maybe we should let him rot in jail thatll teach him
3647079 well do no such thing john he needs to know now more than ever that there are people that care about him even if hes just shot a person dont you think the good christina daniels family from next dor would do the same thing
3647080 they wouldve had johnathan deported the second he arrived on their doorstep
3647081 all right all right agh what the hell is that vib oh my cell

3647085 you were in there an awfully long time what was all the shouting about
3647086 uh yeah he started to try and sell me long distance telephone service you know how i hate telemarketers
3647087 teelmartketers dont autodial cellphones at 2 in the morning johnathan
3647088 they do if its 11am in india lookit its not important but i think we have bigger things to worry about
3647089 shut up teresa this is friggin serious ok im doing nothing more than being a concerned parent and im sorry if that gets in the way of your chill parenting style but our daughters life is at stake here her future
3647090 oh well welcome to the party herr no fun and here i thought that you were just play acting all your concern
3647091 oh shut up john when youre at home you barely bat an eye at our daughter unless she screws up or has some of her cheerleader friends over that just happen to be very well developed and like to swim in our pool you think i dont hear you giving yourself a hand in the bedroom retreat looking out the window at all those nubile young women youve picked a hell of a time to get involved in your daughters life and i have to say youre doing a pretty piss poor job offeigning concern for her well being
3647092 how dare you after all i do for this family i feed you i clothe you i renew your tennis membership every year and this is how you repay me
3647093 this isnt about you john and you never seem to realize that youre always are so damned self absorbed that you rarely can see past your own reflection in the mirror to the little girl wanting daddys attention standing in the background
3647094 look we dont need to have this fight now of all places and times but im concerned about siennas condition
3647095 t may have been something that he hadnt known to look for or something private
3647096 something private enough something that he may only share with her mother
3647097 you knew that she was a slut whoring herself out to that god for nothing wetback
3647098 john shut your goddamned mouth if you ever say anything like that again when our daughter is concious then i swear to god i will divorce you on the spot take half your net worth and display your testicles in a trophy case on my new husbands wall yes i knew i didnt know with whom she had it i thought maybe it was kaz
3647099 kazuo takamori the cellist the country club gave him a scholaship last year so that he could stay in the u s and continue to entertain all of your buddies mistresses at your 500 a plate fundraisers
3647100 you racist prick what the hell does the fact that hes asian have to do with anything
3647101 all im saying is that our daughter doesnt seem to have a prediliction towards white guys
3647102 well with you as a shining exmple of what they are like frankly i dont blame her
3647103 im not the one who started throwing around ethnic slurs like they were lawn darts
3647104 to answer your original question yes i had my suspicions i just thought that given a little time shed come to me rather than me having to confront her
3647105 what you running low on your normal source of liquid courage
3647106 oh so youve cut down to what 7 martinis instead of the normal 8 a night
3647107 yeah so hard that you can sometimes bear to leave a few olives out just so long as you double to grey goose right
3647108 dont you dare play that card with me i cant help the way i am i drink to relax only im not an alcoholic
3647109 teresa you drink like a fish actually the only difference between you and the fish is that the fish doesnt always have to drink to survive
3647110 at least i know my imperfections and attempt to change them
3647111 cant do that when youre on the bathroom floor as unconscious as your daughter
3647112 i swear to god john one more wiseass remark and im enforcing that expensive prenup i had you sign when you were wasted on blow before we got married
3647113 dont worry sweetheart daddyll go get you some water ill be right back
3647114 from about the point where dad was yelling in the bathroom
3647115 its okay mom i know you and daddy arent perfect i know im not im sorry i didnt tell you sooner
3647116 i was also thinking i might want to marry paco get him his green card
3647117 one step at a time honey we dont want to give your father two massive coronaries in a row our health insurance would skyrocket
3647118 oh youll go to college even if we need to get a nanny for your baby but i dont want you growing up ignorant like me only to marry the fist walking checkbook you found attractive
3647119 rest darling youve juts been forcefully lead poisoned you need to sleep if you dont mind me asking though why did paco shoot you
3647120 hm all right rest and maybe we can give you something for the pain if you father ever ends up getting back with that water john john john
3647121 uhm pumpkin i dont know how to tell you this but uhm paco paco is dead he was critically injured during a hostage situation and when he tried resisting the cops beat him up pretty bad apparently the county lockup m e says that paco had a pre existing heart condition and his heart gave out after they tasered him im sorry honey i know you and he were like brother and sister sweetie sweetie are you feeling allright do you want me to get a doctor
3647122 back off john just let her be just let her be
3647123 probably was afraid of losing her people do stupid things when it comes to people they love
3647124 sometimes you run into problems when you start checking on things
3647125 because centreville is such a large building we knew we would not be able to complete the project by the time school started
3647126 i have been close many a time at bigger golf courses like down south in disney world it was just a lucky day
3647127 i went until i was 75 years old until i hit a hole in one
3647128 i did change glasses today and i changed my stance a little i was concentrating on that and i guess that helped me
3647129 im going to use my older ones from now on
3647130 the funny part of it was that i was the only one who had seen the ball on the second one and i wasnt sure it had gone in
3647131 i knew it either went in or it went right behind the pin we didnt actually know it until we got up there
3647132 ive only got two so i told him youre one ahead of me now
3647133 she just won a blue ribbon for her quilting at the county fair in highland
3647134 work will be completed while the money is being raised
3647135 we have every reason to believe the project will be completed on time
3647136 were getting the bleachers put in and turf in this afternoon the lights are up were finishing up concrete work the fence guy starts in monday
3647137 i almost feel like a traitor cheering for new zealand
3647138 i am disappointed we could not give the u s a better game
3647139 new zealand has improved so much in just a short time
3647140 i have to say that this lifestyle is pretty great so maybe i will be back in 2012 in london
3647141 who would have thought it its amazing she has worked so hard she has that desire
3647142 they loved to compete at almost anything it was in them it drove us nuts sometimes
3647143 soccer was the one sport that jenny didnt play in high school
3647144 i think we started when we were in the first grade and she was our goalie all the way through
3647145 thats why were 72 1 in belle clair we had the wall
3647146 what i really enjoy about this moment is being able to feel that competitiveness
3647147 youre heart is in your throat and youre nervous i feel the same way i felt in college when i played in a big game i love it
3647148 i know shes disappointed but she made some critical saves in the first half after that 40 seconds
3647149 she didnt break down thats something to be proud of that you can pull it together and still play at the level that they are playing at
3647150 the most dramatic execution decreases occurred in the rapidly developing democracies of but declines have also occurred in nations such as india and malaysia
3647151 when development and plural democracy take root in asia the decline of the death penalty usually comes sooner rather than later
3647152 i will say that the frame that regards the death penalty as a has become more conspicuous and salient in asia than it was in the past
3647153 and when you frame the death penalty as a human rights issue instead of a crime issue you invite anxiety and concern and resistance to the death penalty because after all its a state killing
3647154 he has no power to do that matters related to student intake are under the jurisdiction of higher
3647155 our constitution stresses balance this is a statistic which should be understood by any leader government or opposition body and nobody should begrude uitm as the only public university for bumiputras
3647156 you can never solve a problem on the level on which it was created
3647157 these results suggest that a patient may benefit the most if these two drugs are given in this particular order
3647158 we eagerly look forward to the results of a large breast cancer trial later this year to confirm our findings this method of treatment could then quickly be incorporated into clinical practice
3647159 the results of this study are very encouraging and could change the way breast cancer patients are treated
3647160 current drugs given to people with lewy body and parkinsons disease simply treat the symptoms
3647161 this model is the first platform to understand how the brain cell deterioration takes place we will use this model to identify targets for new drugs to slow or prevent the disease
3647162 further research using these models will enable us to find new drug targets people with lewy body disease suffer memory loss visual hallucinations and movement difficulties
3647163 unfortunately research is severely underfunded and much more is needed if we are to defeat this devastating disease
3647164 the formation of lewy bodies is a key event in the development of nerve cell death associated with parkinsons disease
3647165 we are frozen in timelessness until someone comes forward and names the person who killed damian
3647166 if any one of the wives or girlfriends or anyone out there knows anything please contact the police
3647167 theres a certain advantage to maintaining the staff you have
3647168 we actually probably wanted more but i understand the justification and the economy as it is

3647172 being the second match of the season this course is a challenging course for the kids
3647173 i did really well at keeping the ball in play and not making a big number which is easy to do out here
3647174 much improved over yesterday obviously with grant weaver you get off to a good start
3647175 they just didnt try to do too much out there made bogeys which are good scores in high school golf when they hit it crooked got it back in play
3647176 theres two teams that are standing out front in the wayne county athletic league and thats dalton and waynedale
3647177 theres a number of us that are going to be looking for improvement to grab that third slot it looks like
3647178 the very general use made of it has more than justified your sanction of its erection
3647179 water pipes therefrom radiate throughout the cemetery providing a plentiful supply for all purposes
3647180 i think its been a pretty great summer for us so far but id say this was our biggest win of the year
3647181 the guys just all get along great and play for each other they know it takes 10 playing together to win and thats what they do we hit good and our defense was huge we probably turned about 15 double plays in the six games
3647182 die ddr hat es gar nicht gegeben und sie war besser als die bundesrepublik
3647183 the joined up approach taken by the three agencies is a welcome step forward and we fully support this initiative it simplifies the whole process of sorting out the mess left behind by fraudsters and helps victims get their finances back on track
3647184 becoming a victim of identity theft can be extremely distressing
3647185 by jointly taking on responsibility for managing the recovery process the three credit reference agencies are aiming to make getting financially back on track much easier for the individual involved
3647186 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression

3647190 the test series was exciting and we want to keep the momentum with the champions trophy starting in three weeks time in pakistan the champions trophy is a vital tournament and the five match series against a tough indian side is ideal leading up to an important tournament
3647191 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand
3647192 and if they think also that somehow its all going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
3647193 if they think this is the way to go we will end up with millions of small farmers all over the world being driven off their land into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness then you count me out i think it will be an absolute disaster
3647194 theyve got a strong brand good retail presence and a nice looking product portfolio that helps to differentiate them from the rest of the market
3647195 no evidence has been found suggesting a connection between the incidents according to the police

3647218 almost every fact in this bitter battle between georgia and russia is disputed who fired the first shots who crossed in to whose land who blinked first
3647219 this is 100 unprovoked brutal russian invasion this is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders we on our own cannot fight with russia we want an immediate ceasefire immediate cessation of hostilities separation of russia and georgia and international mediation this is the most surreal world crisis i could ever imagine and its very unfortunate that it is happening in my country i insist that its happening unprovoked by us and i insist that it was all pre planned

3647242 as you know president bush is on a week long tour to asia where hell visit south korea thailand and china or as the white house calls it the everything sold at wal mart tour
3647243 human rights activists have sent a letter to president bush asking him to raise human rights issues with the chinese government during the olympics unfortunately they also sent a letter to the chinese government asking them to bring up human rights issues with president bush so its pretty much a wash
3647244 president bush arrived in beijing earlier today again i dont think he really understands the olympics that well like they asked him if he liked the decathlon and he said no he preferred regular coffee
3647245 more than 60 heads of state will be at the opening ceremonies so security is extremely tight in china which has been very hard on the locals there many stores and factories in beijing have been required to close and people have been forced out of their houses its sort of like here in the united states only for them itll end in a couple of weeks
3647246 president bush this is interesting was going to make history he becomes the first sitting u s president to attend the olympics in a foreign country he said hes been looking forward to it ever since he heard that in china people are not allowed to make fun of political leaders
3647247 i thought this was nice at one point during the olympic ceremony tonight they had 56 children march in all belonging to john edwards
3647248 while after vigorously denying reports of his extramarital affair and calling the story ridiculous untrue and tabloid trash john edwards today admitted he had an affair and the national enquirer was the only publication writing about it the national enquirer was the first to break it turns out it was true you know what this means elvis is alive bigfoot is real aliens are here its all true
3647249 well democrats are furious theyre going on record now saying john edwards will not be allowed to speak at the convention because of this affair yeah instead speaking in his place bill clinton you have to put your foot down
3647250 in fact when john mccain heard about the john edwards affair he said well thank god i cant get an erection anymore whew some problems just take care of themselves
3647251 barack obama heading to hawaii for a vacation with his family
3647252 earlier this week on the internet paris hilton posted her own ad to spoof the ad john mccain made about her the mccain camp responded by that by saying paris hilton supports mccains approach to americas energy crisis you know how desperate is your presidential campaign when you have to try and convince people that paris hilton agrees with you personally im not voting till i hear what britney has to say
3647253 and that paris hilton ad about john mccain has gotten over five million hits on the web
3647254 well according to a new study coffee can improve your memory thats what they say drinking coffee improves your memory which is good news for both barack obama and john mccain if we can get them to have some coffee before their first debate maybe they can remember what their original positions were

3647262 this is a grave assault on the rights of every worker in britain
3647263 sita suez should be aware that everyone in the uk has the right to join a trade union this is an absolute right and discrimination against or harassment of a worker because of his or her membership or non membership of a trade union is treated very seriously by the courts
3647264 if someone chooses to leave unite and join solidarity that is a matter for that person alone and nothing to do with anybody else especially not the employer
3647265 that unite has sought to involve the bosses in this matter shames them
3647266 like their fascist nulab masters the union bureaucrats have lost touch with their original roots and values they are a distortion of everything for which the early trade unionists stood they have become so twisted that now they a union mind you call for action by the bosses against people for joining another union
3647267 what this shows is that the old trade unions are now clearly in the hands of extremist fascists who will stop at nothing to maintain control of the workplace casting aside democracy and freedom of expression without so much as a second look
3647268 i dont feel like it i just want you to hold me

3647285 i can see great potential for a new ball attack of harmison and anderson if they can both sustain the levels they showed in this oval test they are a contrasting partnership just as harmison and matthew hoggard used to be
3647286 thats absolutely right england need him to come back and strike up that same partnership with anderson in all forms of the game he may complain about the travel and the absence from his family but i can tell him you are a long time retired
3647287 harmison is a professional sportsman he doesnt want to get to the end of his career then look back and wish he had played more for england
3647288 it is a great honour to play for your country and it should be all the more enjoyable when your captain is right behind you telling you that youre the man england need to turn their fortunes around
3647289 i thought the balance of this side selected for the oval test looked much better the challenge for england now is to maintain the intensity and commitment that they showed at the oval thats what makes the australians so good if you look at their attack now their bowlers are not special in terms of natural ability you might even say that england have them covered but the aussies mental attitude their consistency is so exceptional they may not be better bowlers but they are more disciplined more focused and that is where they score over england who have too many bad days
3647290 it is up to the players to maintain the highest of standards they have to take individual responsibility they cant expect the captain to get them pumped up for a match all the time the number of bowlers pressing for selection should help
3647291 above all harmisons success in the last week has proven the value of regular first class cricket we saw the same with ian bell the only innings of substance he played in the series came after he had just got a double hundred for warwickshire
3647292 this evening russia completely devastated the port of poti on the black sea which is a key port for the transportation of energy sources from the caspian sea and is close to the baku supsa pipeline and the supsa oil terminal this act of aggression violates all international war conventions

3647302 its the most fun thing to be in a team environment and be part of a relay its cool when you get four americans who all swim well together everyone has to play their part or its just not going to happen weve been lucky that weve been able to do that
3647303 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3647304 any medal in an event that is not on your regular program is great
3647305 its something i have dreamed about for a long time
3647306 i would have liked to medal but i got my first personal best of the meet and i think thats a good effort
3647307 i cant be upset with that and im just moving on to the next heat

3647319 a few hours ago i as a supreme commander gave an order a very painful order that none of georgias military units open fire in response to the intense bombing

3647352 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3647353 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3647354 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3647355 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3647356 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3647357 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3647358 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3647359 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3647360 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3647361 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3647362 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3647363 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3647364 frequently forgot that they had children and became quite irritable when they were reminded of it
3647365 books of the past that are heavy on piteous but appealing orphans ill tempered and stingy relatives magnanimous benefactors and transformations wrought by winsome children
3647366 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3647367 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3647615 a train of events which continues to have a profound social impact not only in the united states but also in the united kingdom and europe
3647616 you can say that black people are doing it to themselves but thats not the whole story

3647627 i skied up until i was 80 but when i fell and broke my arm i decided maybe i should just stick with swimming
3647628 in the last four five years you have all of these new pools five indoor pools and i cant count all of the outdoor pools
3647629 they have the latest equipment state of the art stuff its amazing
3647630 we didnt have air conditioning and there were no swimming pools for blacks until 1928

3647632 its not easy to get people involved unless they have been personally affected by police brutality
3647633 part of the problem is that we have moved away from social protest in the county and now believe that seeking wealth is the way to escape bad behavior by police or even by other black people
3647634 i believe this is a mistake we cant just turn and run away we have to respond to each incident of police misconduct even if it means taking our protests to the streets or the situation is never going to change
3647635 i get calls every month from people whove had unpleasant experiences with police asking us to do something about this problem
3647636 but were not the kind of organization that will do something for you were the kind of organization that wants you to join with us in an effort to seek justice when they hear that they just seem to drift away

3647638 but when i look out of the window i see the men hanging out doing nothing we have nothing for them to do and that gets to the fact that we dont value them its depressing during slavery you could be prosecuted for killing somebodys slave because a slave had economic value but these guys are considered worthless so police rarely get prosecuted and almost never convicted

3647643 people are beefing not because they are different but because they are the same why does so and so have new shoes but i dont does he think hes better than me why does his neighborhood get called out first at the go go club its absurd but when you add in the easy access to guns it becomes deadly
3647644 they learn from an early age how to live with violence
3647645 they are taught what to do when gunshots ring out drop crawl and roll never run across the street they know the drill
3647646 i was at a gas station and this guy was playing music with a graphic description of killing a snitch he was blasting it and in the car with him were some kids who appeared to be about 7 and 8 years old and im thinking wow whats the message that these kids are going to take from this the guy looked to be in his 40s old enough to know better you dont play a soundtrack for self destruction to your elementary school kids
3647647 the problem for many kids is not a lack of things but a lack of attention
3647648 most children in this city live with single mothers and if the mother gets a boyfriend then most of her efforts go into keeping him all the children have to do is give the appearance of doing good in school and the mother will give them anything they want except quality time and attention

3647657 if the ligaments are damaged then it could take several months to heal

3647670 a large number of ex offenders go in and out of the system as parole violators because no one has been able to pinpoint a good substance abuse treatment plan for them
3647671 in our program we look at the barriers that caused them to be unsuccessful in the past we determine their strengths and weaknesses their treatment readiness and their motivation to change and tie all of that into an individualized treatment plan that prevents them for going back to jail
3647672 the improvement that effective treatment makes in public safety is immense
3647673 we are committed to working collaboratively with our partners to provide customers with a purpose built solution to address persistent data copan systems partners are continuing to benefit from our dedication to the channel and through the enhancement of our programme we can provide greater opportunities for them to increase their profitability increase their customer base and differentiate from the competition
3647674 copan systems presents an attractive opportunity for our customers who are concerned by the sheer volume of data within their organisation their maid platform allows us to offer a credible long term solution rather than a short term band aid approach to the tough challenge of explosive data growth it was their innovative product that attracted us to copan systems and the massive power savings and effective economics of persistent data management that keeps us working with them

3647686 all ive been hearing about is democrats take over this and democrats take control of that

3647691 the only other beckwith i know of is byron de la beckwith the man who assassinated medgar evers
3647692 i think medgar and martin luther king jr and malcolm would be disappointed but im not surprised its the way the system works its not so much about being black or white as having the green
3647693 hes a really really confident lad but you cant get that confused with arrogance
3647694 he works hard hell put tackles in and hes always looking to talk to you and see whats happening
3647695 hes not one of them who thinks hes a maradona

3647701 were dealing with adolescents who have no remorse no regrets
3647702 weve got a lot of new people who are not accustomed to living in an urban environment
3647703 theyll park blocks away from a restaurant or a nightclub then come out in the early morning hours cut through side streets and become easy prey
3647704 you do a robbery and get caught for the fifth time and they send you to oak hill
3647705 then you get released to a group home and nobody tells us that youve been released because juvenile court proceedings are secret we know nothing about your release until you get arrested for the sixth time to most of them its just a joke

3647742 while the caloric benefit was rather modest the take home message from this study as the researchers indicated is that playing these games on wii is better than sitting around
3647743 while many of the wii sports games are fairly realistic one should not mistake the skill set required to be successful in these games with the real thing
3647744 i dont think that anyone is going to become an all star baseball player by skipping practice and playing their wii

3647751 decline in the global oil prices is a welcome development but there is no scope for reduction in domestic prices
3647752 however we think this will be partially offset by price declines in edible oil caustic soda naphtha furnace oil and man made fibre segments

3647780 for many americans the war has become kind of stale news
3647781 people think its hopeless now they want to blame it on the iraqis they concluded that the iraqis dont want to live in peace so they threw the switch
3647782 it seems that many people are just overreacting to temporary fluctuations people who used to be optimistic about rising home prices and rising stocks are now saying im not gaining anymore and i dont like it unless you have to sell your house right now however the effects will be short term

3647785 in the work that weve been doing on the changes in d c during the last decade it has been disturbing to me that the city has not done a better job preserving and expanding affordable housing options for low income residents
3647786 the resurgence of the city and the vitality of the housing market has the potential to benefit everybody but it needs to be managed so that low income families who have endured the hard times can afford to stay and share in the good times

3647840 i have seen young people talk on issues and turn up by the dozen at our meetings
3647841 im anxious to see what kinds of models surface and what opportunities the city makes available to students
3647842 students used to give a brief report at the beginning of the meeting but im not sure they were really involved
3647843 im more interested in asking them how they want to participate
3647844 he was really active but some have been really shy you can get a broad range of students and levels of interest
3647845 they learn a lot about whats going on within the city
3647846 the kids will pick up very quickly on the degree of legitimacy in the process
3647847 their lives are busy just like everyone elses if they perceive it as a token young person on a committee or whatever role it might be that wont fly for very long

3647857 theres no question of the sport coming under threat it wont die out
3647858 its been a tough time for businesses theyve not had a great time of it theres less confidence and investing hasnt been huge
3647859 over the years the total attendance has been falling by one to two percent
3647860 the core of traditional people has been dwindling but at the same time new people have come
3647861 the majority will continue with the trainers and race at other tracks
3647862 but for the ones that are getting near the end of their careers the kindest thing would be to find them a new home
3647863 there are massive misconceptions about them they are complete coach potatoes they only want a little walk and spend the rest of the time sitting down
3647864 im absolutely gutted to see the stadium close ive been coming since i was a boy
3647865 walthamstow without the stadium is like paris without the eiffel tower
3647866 its an iconic building it made you feel alive it was a sport second to none theres no better feeling in the world
3647867 its a done deal any negotiations between the new owners and the consortium are nothing to do with us
3647868 owing to a belief that there was a potential threat to life the firearms support unit was called to assist with the control of the incident
3647869 police negotiators are also at the scene in a bid to bring the incident to a safe conclusion
3647870 the police intention remains to resolve the incident without harm to anybody involved these efforts are still ongoing
3647871 the past decade has seen unprecedented growth in liverpools economy which has surpassed many southern towns and cities
3647872 millions of visitors during our capital of culture year have seen for themselves the massive investment which is transforming liverpool into a top european city
3647873 even the reports authors said it was likely to be dismissed as barmy
3647874 little prospect of offering their residents the standard of living to which they aspire
3647875 realistic about the ability of cities such as manchester leeds and newcastle to regenerate struggling nearby towns such as liverpool bradford and sunderland
3647876 no one is suggesting that residents should be forced to move but we do argue that they should be told the reality of the position regeneration in the sense of convergence will not happen because it is not possible
3647877 no doubt some people will claim that these proposals are unworkable unreasonable and perhaps plain barmy
3647878 but the issue is clear current regeneration policies are failing the very people they are supposed to be helping and there is no evidence that the trend will be reversed without radical changes internal migration has always been an important part of a dynamic economy
3647879 the reality of today is that the regeneration of cities and i can only speak for liverpool but its certainly improving by leaps and bounds
3647880 a dry statistical analysis does show that we are behind the south of england but what it also shows is that we are improving almost on a daily basis
3647881 the whole thing is riddled with errors it goes on about liverpool being a coastal port and that it was in decline
3647882 well i have to tell the authors it may be in decline compared to the figures they produce for dover and felixstowe its not in decline compared to its own record it puts a bigger tonnage out and is more profitable now than it has ever been
3647883 no government has done more to turn around decades of neglect and since 1997 cities like manchester liverpool and newcastle have benefited from thousands of new jobs lower crime rates and better living standards thanks to our sustained commitment to regeneration and investment in public services
3647884 its alarming that this think tank is labelling our great cities as beyond revival and arguing that we should target less effort on them when those areas that have received regeneration funding have shown the greatest improvements
3647885 most parents worry that if their kids skip school they go to the mall
3647886 some students just dont do well in a big school this is an alternative
3647887 math is the one score we were most scared of because it tends to be tied to innovation
3647888 if we had it our way it would be 220 days but that might have been a shock to 15 year olds

3647901 at the moment im a bit curvier having done the tour so it was big mental step forward for me to show my natural self rather than my worked out honed self

3647930 by no means are we giving up on clay buchholz
3647931 far from it we still think hes going to be a huge part of our future and may well prove to be an important part of our present
3647932 that said we think this move gives us the freedom to do the right thing in our rotation rather than maybe forcing people into roles because of injury so well see how things play out but by no means is clay buchholz out of our picture
3647933 we think byrd can add a veteran presence some stability to our starting rotation
3647934 hes been on a roll lately since the all star break hes been pretty darn good every time out there
3647935 this is a guy whos been through this before hes someone we think can be dependable for us and we know what were going to get every fifth day
3647936 it just seems like the right time to add this kind of stabilizer given the fact that tim wakefield is on the dl bartolo colons still rehabbing buchholz is still working through some things you never want to get caught short on starting pitching in august and september because theres very little you can do about it
3647937 hes going to consistently locate and throw strikes and change speeds and show great feel on the mound
3647938 you only get so many chances to win it all last year was really tough for us and for me to get traded to the team that beat us feels a little weird i cant wait to get started and give the people of boston all ive got
3647939 i think i was tipping my pitches a little bit
3647940 i changed my glove and its rock hard so if i cover first ill be in trouble but i cant wiggle it and give away pitches i changed my motion so i wasnt going over my head with my hands anymore its enabling me to keep the ball down a little bit
3647941 ive had an up and down season its been a roller coaster ride but as far as me right now im extremely confident i like the way im throwing the ball i have no fear no wonder about which pitcher is going to show up

3647953 the girl has been transported in critical condition to the hospital
3647954 it took a long time to get that girl stabilized
3647955 so i put my shoes on grabbed my gun and as soon as i walked around the corner the dog was attacking her right outside the front yard
3647956 to be honest with you i was afraid to go in the door
3647957 the little girl was laying on the floor in the trailer there and nobody was doing anything i went and put pressure on her neck where the dog bit her
3647958 i just did what i could and the paramedics came and took over

3647961 any new israeli leader of any political party is sure to maintain the usual israeli policies of murder assassination and illegal settlement building
3647962 when a new kadima party chairman is chosen i will resign as prime minister
3647963 israel suffered a number of major setbacks under his leadership especially the defeat in 2006
3647964 was never more than a transitional figure with little impact on israeli foreign policy
3647965 he comes from the military establishment and as a student of sharon he could be the only one with the strength to convince israeli public opinion to make concessions in the peace process
3647966 her lack of military experience and capabilities in contrast to mofaz represents a major weakness
3647967 netanhayus day is over israelis still remember his inability to provide security when he served as pm in the 1990s
3647968 as for the labour party the days of its historic leadership typified by slain israeli pm yitzhak rabin ended long ago all the current party leaders lack the weight of their predecessors
3647969 no matter who takes olmerts place the peace process will continue to face enormous obstacles
3647970 from the arab perspective all the contenders mofaz livni and netanyahu are equally unpropitious
3647971 in any case the arab position on the palestine issue based on the 2002 arab initiative will remain unchanged
3647972 whenever the israelis come under pressure to reach a workable agreement with the arabs they come up with dramatic new distractions like resignations or early elections anything to put off a settlement
3647973 every year they promise the establishment of a palestinian state and every time something happens to derail it
3647974 its obvious the israelis are just killing time in order to maintain the status quo
3647975 ive got three races left so there had better be something left in the tank
3647976 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race
3647977 i wanted a world record i wanted 1 51 or better but in the circumstances its not too bad i guess
3647978 its the most fun thing to be in a team environment and be part of a relay

3647988 as well as the new press ads we will be running our much loved radio spots on scotlands largest commercial station were also running on the air competitions to further engage with local listeners
3647989 to coincide with the new campaign will be launch of a consumer web site for specially selected pork which will enable consumers to learn more about the specially selected brand and to discover a range of delicious recipe ideas featuring fresh specially selected pork and other pork products such as ham bacon and sausages
3647990 the site will also highlight the world leading welfare assurances that come from choosing specially selected pork
3647991 we are also bringing the brand to life in store with clear branding to enable customers to clearly identify and choose specially selected pork
3647992 it is an extremely ambitious plan but its challenged because its very dependent on many governments which equals many politicians
3647993 imagine how much thats going to multiply in complexity with 13 countries trying to agree on whats going to happen
3647994 the role of a chaplain on the battlefield is to provide spiritual moral and ethical well being to the soldiers
3647995 also to ensure that soldiers rights in combat are not violated that is their mission
3647996 im proud of the brigades chaplains for being so in touch with the soldiers out at the jsss and cops
3647997 services at the cops and jsss allow soldiers the time and opportunity to worship in between missions
3647998 i like being able to spend time with the soldiers and share in the risks they take daily i am able to share life with them
3647999 the services provide me an opportunity to address some of the issues that all soldiers have experienced during the course of this deployment
3648000 the music provides the soldiers the chance to participate in the service
3648001 chaplain fisher has a way of raising my morale and something about him boosts the other guys morale too
3648002 he gives soldiers a chance to forget about everything going on to worship god
3648003 i have been really fortunate to work with the commanders and first sergeants
3648004 they accommodate my chaplain assistant and me around the battlefield to all the right places i am grateful to be here with the 2nd bn 4th inf regt i love serving with these guys we have thousands of people praying for us back home
3648005 it was interesting i got in on the last day of filing just to protect the seat
3648006 but i promised bruce that i wouldnt campaign against him until the term limits issue was resolved
3648007 i just want people to know again that im grateful for the opportunity theyve given me
3648008 and theyll be hearing from me to some extent during the campaign
3648009 its not a matter of capturing it back its not in anyones hands right now in my opinion its always been in the hands of the voters
3648010 who is better able to bring about the change we need and turn our economy around
3648011 my chest swells with pride so much that im afraid my bra straps will break
3648012 i am really proud to be part of anything that dina titus does
3648013 if they have a strong platform for helping working people and making sure that we have affordable housing and good living conditions then thats the candidate im for
3648014 its just like the everyday things that we worry about our childrens education the cost of our housing i mean look at the cost of fuel right now its ridiculous you have to decide do i eat or do i put gas in the car so i can go to work to pay a mortgage
3648015 everybody should have a choice were not like animals that you just put away somewhere and throw a bowl of food in
3648016 a regular person doesnt have to fight for stuff all the time we just want to do our life like everyone else
3648017 im quite pleased with the results it was a pretty strong campaign
3648018 its a predominantly democratic district so i think ill fare very well in the general race and i think my experience will help too
3648019 there were a lot of democratic candidates there and a lot of very excited folks
3648020 it was a very energized crowd full of my volunteers and dinas a culmination of all our hard work
3648021 the general election is going to be a tough race whatll make it interesting is that the registration is evenly split so there will be a lot of effort to get voters out it will also be important to explain the issues to voters where we stand
3648022 we have 12 weeks until the general election thats 84 days and that starts tomorrow
3648023 as an educator for the last 36 years in the clark county school district ive really seen how education has been affected so i really believe i have a better feel for whats actually occurring here in nevada
3648024 so many of the people i talked with said about obama if i want to feel good ill read a book or see a musical and one man even told me that hes not ready yet he needs to bake a little more
3648025 were feeling 100 percent positive about obama hes going to come out above mccain because mccain is a definite bush man
3648026 i think the energy is for change i think its for everybody along with dina i think everybody is tired of what has gone on the gas prices the energy theyre just tired and they need a new change
3648027 needed to work on a cause she really believed in
3648028 i support obama but i think hes making a big mistake if he doesnt put clinton on as vice president
3648029 it was an incredible experience to be able to serve i met so many wonderful people
3648030 im gratified that a substantial number of people chose to vote for me even though i wasnt eligible
3648031 im looking forward to getting out into the district meeting with the voters and discussing these issues
3648032 were pleasantly surprised that this is the way things went
3648033 we worked very hard to reach this point and well be well prepared for the general election were going to hit the ground running
3648034 i find a dearth of information in our newspapers about who these people are
3648035 after a while you can become complacent nobody needs to be in office for 30 40 years
3648036 i feel he should be allowed to continue but you have to deal with what the courts say
3648037 their county budget is the first place ill start im going to transition the fiscal accountability that ive done at the city
3648038 thats where it all begins and where it all ends
3648039 i believe our message is a strong one that there are solutions to this economy
3648040 we need to fundamentally think differently this race is not about maintaining the status quo and thats what my opponent does
3648041 first and foremost i want to thank all of my supporters and friends who have been with me throughout this difficult race it was a tough campaign but i managed to stay positive throughout and im proud of that im thankful to have had the opportunity to serve my district for four years and i accomplished much of what i set out to do
3648042 id like to congratulate my opponent for his victory and wish him luck in the general election
3648043 people in my line of work are losing their jobs
3648044 this is my third election cycle and id say its been par for the course for a primary

3648052 the house was built with maximum regard for the environment and by reciprocation gives us a unique opportunity to live close to nature being your own have a go architect is a lot of fun and allows you to create and enjoy something which is part of yourself and the land rather than at worst a mass produced box designed for maximum profit and convenience of the construction industry building from natural materials does away with producers profits and the cocktail of carcinogenic poisons that fill most modern buildings

3648061 i know people are making a big deal out of his age but its up to the individual
3648062 hes coming off a great year so why shouldnt people expect another great year the question is whether the rest of the team is up to it i dont think you have to worry about the quarterback position
3648063 isnt what he used to be as far as arm strength
3648064 he threw 98mph as a rookie and all these years later hes still a power pitcher except maybe hes at 94 hes absolutely one of the five best throwers of the football thats ever played

3648086 they have been attacking georgia from a cyber standpoint since july
3648087 our poor technician here has gotten three hours sleep in the past four days
3648088 the cyber attack was taking down every georgian government website
3648089 it is simply too early and we lack enough information to reach any conclusion as to the motive and identity of the attackers
3648090 these types of attack are only natural and happen immediately following any conflict or political tension
3648091 this actually looks more like grass roots hacktivist types people that jumped on the bandwagon
3648092 its like the olympics we are supposed to be above politics in the internet community
3648093 dont you worry about the distance im right there if you get lonely
3648094 the summer break is absolutely essential for all the people who travel
3648095 they dont get enough time with their families and this gives them an opportunity to have at least one week where theyre not at the office or workshop

3648103 the philosophy was in these large natural areas fire should be allowed to play its role
3648104 what happened in 88 in yellowstone was probably a passing of the threshold with what the political and social world was comfortable with it was perceived that we were burning up their national park and there would be nothing left of it
3648105 because people didnt understand it we didnt do a good enough job explaining it back then it became known as the let it burn policy
3648106 we learned a lot in 1988 about how much fire a park could take before they ran out of resources
3648107 i think the overriding message of our report was as big as these fires were and as important as they were in many ways they were not historically unprecedented and it was not unnatural
3648108 we very emphatically said and i think the 20 years since then have confirmed that the fires were not an ecological disaster
3648109 actually its a lot greener now hopefully we learned from that its ok to let nature do what it needs to do clean house
3648110 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes

3648115 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3648116 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3648117 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3648118 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3648119 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3648120 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3648121 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3648122 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3648123 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3648124 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3648125 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

3648129 sight of russian tanks rolling into parts of a sovereign country will have brought a chill down the spine of many people rightly
3648130 no i think the article set out a very clear agenda for defending the record of the government for advancing a clear vision of the future of britains new place economically socially and internationally and for drawing a strong contrast with the tories
3648131 i have spoken to the prime minister yesterday about the business of government and that is what we are focused on hes leading the government forward with determination and vigour i am focused on my job and my job at the moment despite the fact that i was on holiday im focused on my job which is being foreign secretary at a time when there is a serious international crisis which needs british values and british diplomacy

3648134 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
3648135 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
3648136 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
3648137 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
3648138 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
3648139 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
3648140 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
3648141 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
3648142 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
3648143 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
3648144 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
3648145 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
3648146 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
3648147 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
3648148 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
3648149 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
3648150 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
3648151 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
3648152 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
3648153 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
3648154 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
3648155 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
3648156 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
3648157 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
3648158 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
3648159 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
3648160 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

3648170 i think they could be as good as it gets in the champions league
3648171 they are both in the top class level and can be as good as anyone if they play together more games then they can get better and better
3648172 i would prefer them to have played together more but we couldnt with both torres and keane coming in late it wasnt the ideal situation but i think it could be enough
3648173 but both torres and keane are prepared enough to play well little by little they can get better if one of them or both can play well on wednesday then that would be fantastic
3648174 in the time they have had together they have played well and we have been scoring goals they need time but we have confidence in them and i think we played well in the last game against lazio
3648175 chelsea ran them very close last year and ive got a sneaking feeling they might go one better
3648176 manchester united are sure to be without cristiano ronaldo at the start of the season and hes a big miss even for just a few games
3648177 once again i think it will be very tight between the two
3648178 its been hard for manchester united to plan for next season with so many rumours and possibilities surrounding their star player
3648179 it would have been unsettling for the management they werent sure if he was going to go would they get the money to spend on replacements
3648180 the fans will be a bit disgruntled for a while but once he plays a couple of games and bangs
3648181 you can foresee a change in style with scolari favouring a more attacking and free spirited sort of game pass and move rather than the slightly negative style of play that chelsea have played over the last few years
3648182 you need a mixture of experience and youth and chelsea probably have that
3648183 you need players of experience and stature when push comes to shove
3648184 thats where they fell short last year and i cant see anything in their squad to change that
3648185 they will always have a chance though because they play such beautiful football
3648186 with torres in their side theyll always score goals but overall you wonder if theyve quite got the squad to compete with the others
3648187 its fair to say the teams that come up will struggle by and large
3648188 west brom could do okay theyre a bit up and down but i think it will be difficult and a battle from day one

3648190 these games are very dangerous so we will be very focused on the game
3648191 the first game is really important we have the advantage of playing the second leg at anfield but if we can have a good result in the first game then it will be better for us
3648192 i dont think the financial need to qualify for the group stages puts on any added pressure every year it has been the same we have experience of this in the past and weve always got through so hopefully we can do the same
3648193 but every club the top sides especially must be aware of the quality of the other teams in this competition you must be focused for every game and you cant change things if you make a mistake

3648240 we wanted to cheer her up and there arent many things you can give to someone who is ill
3648241 i thought it was taking away something very important from someone who wasnt very well if i was on a ward id like to receive cards
3648242 we had never heard of this before and can only assume it is due to any bugs in the flowers or vases being knocked over
3648243 we asked if they could be left in a dayroom or nurses quarters but this was also rejected and they wouldnt dispose of them so the alternative was to bin them or bring them home
3648244 frenchay is a wonderful hospital but it seems a shame people cant receive cards or flowers they could maybe put the cards and flowers in an area away from the beds
3648245 many older people find get well cards to be a reassuring and pleasant distraction from illness while in hospital
3648246 while we fully understand the paramount importance of keeping hospital wards clean and tidy we cant help wondering whether this isnt a case of using a sledgehammer to crack a nut we would hope that with a bit of flexible thinking it would be possible to allow older people to recover with appropriate support from family and friends
3648247 we dont prevent patients displaying get well cards on the wards
3648248 however maintaining a clean environment and reducing infection is this trusts number one priority
3648249 it is particularly important that the area around the patients bed is kept as clean as possible and is free of clutter so our cleaners can get complete access
3648250 responsibility for cleanliness lies with the sister in charge on each ward and if they feel cards on display by a patients bedside are getting in the way of domestic staff they will ask them to be taken down
3648251 we hope this particular patient and their family understand the very good reasons why they were asked to do this
3648252 there are any number of opportunities for russia to reverse course and to demonstrate that it is trying to behave according to 21st century principles
3648253 but i can assure you that russias international reputation and what role russia can play in the international community is very much at stake here
3648254 as the cost of living is on the up these figures even if they are only part reflective of pensioners as a whole are of real concern
3648255 retirement should be a time to enjoy yourself after all those years of hard work
3648256 the cost of living for the elderly has surpassed inflation over the past decade therefore it is more important than ever that consumers are aware of the dangers of approaching retirement with such large amounts of debt
3648257 for many pensioners today these figures show its a case of bought then worrying about it now
3648258 with the costs of living increasing dramatically particularly as winter approaches and fuel costs mount up it is vital that those struggling are given the help they need to ensure that people arent trapped by debt

3648267 in the past five years a secondary market has developed in credit card debt that mirrors the one in the mortgage market theres been a growth in brokers resellers and people getting into the business including lawyers
3648268 there are already more lawsuits filed by people who dont own the debt
3648269 theres more money in suing businesses over debt than consumers
3648270 the sheriff can go out and pick up a bulldozer
3648271 well have to see what this economy does theres a lag time to these things
3648272 what companies used to let slide now more and more debt collectors are buying the permission and ability to go after the money and are getting more aggressive
3648273 in the late 80s and early 90s when there were regional and small state banks failing collection rates skyrocketed and they were throwing collection work at lawyers
3648274 were getting ready to gear up again paper could be flooding the street
3648275 but if you think about it without collections nobody else gets anything done
3648276 this debt collection firm is charged with unlawfully harassing texas debtors
3648277 at a time when too many texans are struggling to protect their homes the defendants unlawful letters are threatening debtors with legal action homestead liens and wage garnishment in violation of the law the office of the attorney general will vigorously enforce laws that prevent debt collectors from harassing or threatening texas consumers
3648278 he basically pulled out a bottle of lighter fluid poured it all over his body pulled out a cigarette lighter and lit himself on fire
3648279 we dont know if he had mental health issues or what sparked it
3648280 waktu belum terlambat sebab walaupun hantu maut sudah mendekam di tepi langit belumlah api membakar dan mengamuk alam semesta
3648281 due to the vulnerable position consumers find themselves in when dealing with debt collectors it is imperative that the state protect the interests reputations and fiscal well being of its citizens against these collectors who engage in abusive and unfair practices
3648282 legitimate debt collection agencies know the rules and follow them but some debt is sold to other companies which use threats and intimidation and disregard an industry code of ethics that prohibits these kinds of behaviors
3648283 it depends on what moment in time youre going to measure at
3648284 the program is getting closer to self funding but right now the program falls slightly short of funding itself
3648285 forty states already have private debt collection programs and 25 use them for unpaid taxes
3648286 and theres a 10 year statute on collecting unpaid taxes every year is another year that billions more vanish
3648287 its unfathomable that for political reasons this program is being targeted for extinction
3648288 theres 3 5 billion in debts that the irs shelved that means they never intended to collect on that debt if this program was expanded we could get some of that money back
3648289 knowing that the irs isnt going to collect the debt also gives tax cheats additional incentives not to pay
3648290 this report is another piece of evidence that the private debt collection program should have a chance to work
3648291 the intent of that 25 percent which the irs keeps was to enhance collections at the agency
3648292 if the program was fully operational and had 12 firms as originally intended youd probably need 1 000 new irs employees to deal with the collections
3648293 in the absence of other assurances to secure adequate emergency response coverage for nova scotians in the event of a work interruption or strike we see discussion of this topic as our right and perhaps even our obligation to the public
3648294 you cannot go forward in the health industry without spending a dime
3648295 i believe in this round of negotiations more so than any other round the paramedics of this province are greatly united in standing together for what theyve been trying to get since 1997
3648296 it was one of many factors that contributed to better results
3648297 its not all layoffs its also just reconfiguring when people work and what time they work
3648298 people werent visiting our casino it didnt matter how few or how many staff we had the casino property itself was too large
3648299 we had to downsize the halifax facility physically and therefore obviously staff would lose their jobs because we werent having as many positions open
3648300 theres an anti gaming sentiment thats been promoted for a number of years
3648301 if anything i said can be interpreted as sexist i unequivocally and wholeheartedly apologize and withdraw my comments
3648302 i have always been a strong supporter of women in politics and want to encourage not hinder their participation in the public sphere
3648303 if they wanted to take me out i would think youd get someone whos looking forward to building a political career not somebody whos at the age where hes considering retirement
3648304 seeing the reaction of people today it would seem my comments were reflecting on the larger group or women in general and that was not the intention of my comment so i thought the only way to put it to bed was to issue an apology and retraction
3648305 when you live in a fish bowl you gotta watch how you swim
3648306 stephane dion must show that these comments are not acceptable in the political process and immediately reprimand his caucus members
3648307 its upsetting and ridiculous to hear this from an elected official
3648308 it should never have happened in the first place there has to be a direct apology to marjory lebreton and i just think its an assault on those who are running and those who would think about running
3648309 why didnt rona ambrose speak out when peter mackay called belinda stronach a dog
3648310 i think its kind of short sighted on her part or anyone elses to insist that thibault be reprimanded

3648329 the retail needle doesnt move too much if ucla or north carolina get to the final four they already do well in sales and are expected to be there

3648343 at first there is a little bit of disappointment that i didnt medal but i cant be disappointed id been very fortunate to make it through the rounds in the fashion that i did make it through
3648344 to come from 10th to fourth i am just delighted
3648345 there was somebody looking out for me i was very fortunate
3648346 this whole olympics has been a roller coaster after everything that happened to go from my semi final run to cut it back in the final i was ecstatic and then as people started to go down i was getting more and more happy
3648347 i think that is what has helped me deal with the ups and downs of it all
3648348 you can build a course for 3m and make them commercially successful from rafting and tourism

3648351 in engeland gaat iedereen er zonder meer vanuit dat de gunners zich plaatsen voor het hoofdtoernooi van de champions league
3648352 daarom voelt onze spelersgroep dan ook geen enkele druk en kunnen we vrijuit spelen
3648353 we beginnen ontspannen aan de wedstrijd we geloven in een goede afloop wellicht is een stuntje mogelijk in ieder geval gaan we genieten omdat we tenslotte toch tegen arsenal afgelopen seizoen de nummer drie van de premier league spelen
3648354 we gaan het arsenal zeker moeilijk maken dat kan ook vanuit onze underdogpositie en dan kunnen we hopelijk over veertien dagen met vertrouwen afreizen voor de return in londen
3648355 the goal is to defeat obama i dont want obama to be in office
3648356 for one blacktop stays hot and could continue to generate energy after the sun goes down unlike traditional solar electric cells
3648357 in addition there is already a massive acreage of installed roads and parking lots that could be retrofitted for energy generation so there is no need to find additional land for solar farms
3648358 finally unlike roof top solar arrays which some find unattractive the solar collectors in roads and parking lots would be invisible
3648359 we designed the computer simulations to show that as the ocean temperature increased hurricanes would form more rapidly and easily even in the presence of wind shear instead we got exactly the opposite result as the water temperature increased the effectiveness of the wind shear in suppressing hurricane formation actually became greater
3648360 the additional aspect that our method offers is a much more accurate picture of the process of tropical storm and hurricane formation as compared to the global models
3648361 if you ask will it not be good that if before impeachment an honourable exit should be worked out my answer would be yes it could be a good option

3648396 having won two tt races this year i should be super confident but i have never won a race at the ulster although i was very close last year when i was in a five lap shake up at the end of the dundrod 150 which takes place on thursday night that was on dry roads of course and it was a terrific battle before guy martin got home from john mcguinness but not everyone remembers that bruce and myself were right on top of the leading pair as was ian hutchinson in fact the first five riders could have been covered by an economy sized blanket
3648397 although donald hasnt had a win here i think he can set a new lap record on thursday night but again it depends on the weather
3648398 as for anstey hes had five wins at the ulster grand prix and no one knows the course better
3648399 rain will not hinder bruce but obviously all of us in the team would prefer no problems
3648400 you find when the weather is bad spirits are low and the riders take care of themselves which is only natural there is only the sunshine which brings out the best in us and the fastest laps
3648401 if you were to ask me whom i would back to beat us i would say ryan farquhar loves wet roads and he would have to be favourite if that were the case
3648402 ryan has a terrific record at dundrod especially in the wet and we will certainly be keeping an eye on him on thursday at any rate and then on saturday when the ulster grand prix takes place
3648403 ian will be at dundrod on saturday and perhaps thursday cheering his team mates on and lets hope he has something to cheer about
3648404 last year was a nightmare because of the conditions but hopefully ill get a chance to show my best this time
3648405 im not worried about rain it doesnt really concern me but i would like to show the fans what i can really do
3648406 i would hope to get among the winners at the weekend but im not keen on riding in damp conditions
3648407 im hoping to go close at the ulster and in the dundrod 150 on thursday
3648408 but the class of opposition is pretty high and if i get in the first three i believe ill be doing well
3648409 mark was one of the first people to phone me when i was dropped by mitsubishi and he offered to talk to teg sport about me joining them
3648410 at the time i was still in a bit of a daze after being axed by mitsubishi and decided to stick with what i know and drive my own lancer
3648411 but having thought about it i felt i had nothing to lose and quite a lot to gain by going to an established team like teg sport even though i have never rallied a subaru before
3648412 it has all come together very late but im happy to be joining such a good team
3648413 i personally think he we will do well on the ulster i would like to see him get a strong finish a good top five he has not driven the car before and there is a lot of pressure on him at the minute so i hope he has no dramas and a stress free run
3648414 mark higgins was instrumental in sorting this they are good friends and he helped phillip put together this deal
3648415 id like to think it is not a one off but we will have to wait and see there is still a lot to be decided and at the moment the car is plain white it has all happened so quickly
3648416 we couldnt be more enthusiastic about the fantastic schedule we have planned for mercedes benz fashion week this season once again we are showcasing both the most well known and up and coming designers in the world

3648428 i gave it everything and i had nothing left i left it all in the pool just disappointed i didnt get up there for a medal but
3648429 i couldnt tell where i was i was hurting and just trying to pick it up but i just had nothing there
3648430 the whole thing was reasonably painful but the last 40m was really really tough and the last 10m it feels like youve got lead arms
3648431 i knew id have to go out a lot quicker than i had been i was just trying to hold on looking at the splits i may have gone a little bit too quick
3648432 its mixed feelings i was hoping to actually go quicker than that overall i thought id probably have to to get a medal

3648437 there were 33 processions today people were angry especially because of what happened yesterday there were four incidents of firing in srinagar city while forces opened fire at three other places we have exhibited maximum restraint two of our sub divisional police officers including a young ips officer an sho and 192 police and paramilitary force personnel were injured the protestors burnt three of our vehicles and damaged 33 other government vehicles
3648438 russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
3648439 and im not saying we are reigniting the cold war but this is an act of aggression in which we didnt think wed see in the 21st century
3648440 for mccains team it has become the latest incarnation of what
3648441 you got a guy who is ready to be president on day 1 who understands the world for what it is
3648442 the thing about sen obama hes playing catch up here his initial statements quite frankly didnt appreciate how bold a move this was from russia
3648443 sen mccain has talked for years about the dangers of russian policies in the way they conduct themselves and undermine the sovereignty of their neighbors
3648444 there is a depth of knowledge a breadth of knowledge and an extent of historical experience
3648445 barack obama the administration and the nato allies took a measured reasoned approach
3648446 we were dealing with the facts as we knew them john mccain shot from the hip very aggressive belligerent statement he may or may not have complicated the situation
3648447 russian peacekeeping troops should be replaced by a genuine international peacekeeping force georgia should refrain from using force in south ossetia and abkhazia and a political settlement must be reached that addresses the status of these disputed regions
3648448 he was not calling for equivalence between russia and georgia he was calling for a ceasefire to stop the violence after russia invaded it was a totally different order of magnitude
3648449 it is based on an exaggerated and deliberately misleading perception of senator obamas initial statement which was issued early while the crisis was unfolding
3648450 this is an attempt by people supporting senator mccain to politicize a great international tragedy and its not worthy of the dimensions of the problem especially when both candidates have roughly the same position
3648451 part of the reason we dont have leverage is that we dont have a u s russian relationship it has been adrift
3648452 its easy to say something belligerent about russia im no friend of vladimir putin and cheap shots about tough talk are all well and fine but what are you doing to actually make the situation better
3648453 this type of bluster is fairly counterproductive because it is a bluff theres nothing we can do about this
3648454 it has become a race to be see who can be the tougher i cant see anybody suddenly stepping back and becoming a voice of moderation and calling for calm

3648459 i have ordered reinstatement with conditions to balance united group nzs concerns as to how reinstatement in the short term could be accommodated with mr edmunds arguable case that his dismissal was unjustified
3648460 i accept at face value mr edmunds expressed desire to return to work at united group nz and his concern about maintaining his reputation in the business community there is no evidence of financial hardship
3648461 i like to spoil parties quite often i get dressed up
3648462 the fact its back here over at subiaco puts a lot of pressure on st kilda knowing they didnt perform that well two weeks ago when they lost to west coast

3648471 the increase in oil and commodity prices is damaging corporate profits
3648472 the fundamentals of the economy are much better than in the previous post bubble cycles
3648473 the downside risks remain elevated but we expect that this cyclical downturn will be a relatively mild one
3648474 its very hard for the boj to move despite the increase in prices

3648477 its not the biggest country town and everybody knows everybody
3648478 theres no sectarianism or disagreement to release stress factors into the community and people here love exercise so that helps them live longer too
3648479 i cant think of anywhere in northern ireland where there are so many care homes
3648480 the local community really do look after the older residents here some people say that there are almost too many coffee shops and the like aimed at us

3648492 the pattern of attacks three in a row during the games with security forces on high alert is an act of defiance that is unparalleled in recent xinjiang history
3648493 the global focus on china is an opportunity for people who believe their plight is ignored and invisible to take action
3648494 the concern here is that at a minimum this is going to add volatility to the region and polarize the uighur and chinese communities
3648495 there is also a fear the government will launch a widespread indiscriminate repressive campaign targeted far beyond the groups advocating use of violence
3648496 we can see that the attackers are merciless fugitives so the government should be on high alert
3648497 because they cannot carry out such attacks in their most desirable cities like beijing they have to turn to local locations
3648498 their methods are quite similar to some other international terrorist attacks

3648500 singapore like all asean countries is committed to the principle that asean should be at the center of any regional architecture all asean dialogue partners have supported this principle prime minister rudds proposal appears to be a departure from australias previous position
3648501 if that is the case and we have humanitarian access australia as always will be in there through the appropriate international agencies including the red cross to provide practical humanitarian help
3648502 australians expect our government always to be out there with a helping hand when people are in need and there are something like 100 000 displaced persons im advised in this particular war zone in georgia
3648503 australia of course stands ready to contemplate humanitarian assistance there have been a large number of civilians who have been killed or injured or displaced
3648504 at officer level in new york through the un georgia approached a number of countries for military assistance
3648505 our response was of course the obvious which is we are not interested in a military solution here were interested in ceasefire and a dialogue so that was made very clear
3648506 according to initial estimates the bomb was made up of 20 kilogrammes 44 pounds of explosives
3648507 now the army and the people are being targeted when it used to be the politicians who were the targets

3648511 i might not have grown up in the best environment but i was supported by everyone around me that is how i get these great results

3648537 we could have gone with tickets and been totally safe but we are showing faith in our supporters and i am confident that cliftonville fans wont let the club down
3648538 we were angry that the irish cup semi final was brought forward because we thought we had got away from that kind of thing but ourselves and linfield have been the victims in the past of the situation in this country and that has been through no fault of our own
3648539 we have worked on a tolerance and respect of each others traditions and we have made it work for our benefit and the benefit of irish league football
3648540 this is the start of a new league a new era for irish league football and we are trying to help move the game forward by asking for our fans to be able to pay in at windsor park
3648541 as a club we have worked hard to weed out the trouble makers and we have done that with the help of the genuine cliftonville fans
3648542 very soon we will be sitting down and making arrangements for when linfield come to solitude for the game which will be live on sky sports
3648543 hopefully we can start lifting some of the restrictions on linfield fans that have been in place for previous matches at solitude and in time have no restrictions at all

3648548 in an age when senior clubs like ours are being licensed to ensure their compliance with best practice and business standards i think it is absolutely essential that the product that is the premiership is professionally promoted and administered

3648552 that is why i submit the moors in spain achieved such a high culture their fathers were born into a polygamous tradition but their mothers were the daughters of christians and jews and had spent their early years in an absolutely monogamous environment the sons of these women laid the foundations of rationalistic culture but soon the supply of christian and jewish women was insufficient so the incipient rationalism failed to mature greatly
3648553 a female emancipating movement is a cultural phenomenon of unfailing regularity it appears to be the necessary outcome of absolute monogamy the subsequent loss of social energy after the emancipation of women which is sometimes emphasized has been due not to the emancipation but to the extension of sexual opportunity which has always accompanied it in human records there is no instance of female emancipation which has not been accompanied by an extension of sexual opportunity

3648610 the arroyo government is wiping out indigenous communities all over the country through its militarist and aggressive economic policies another reason is that the president does not intend to cease these injustices
3648611 the realization of the rights of national minorities to ancestral lands and self determination will only be fully realized when the government is no longer bound by capitalist interests until then the indigenous and moro peoples rights is only second to the interests of companies interested in the resources found in ancestral domains

3648645 caregivers have a long exposure to stresses and losses from the dementia and fatigue that comes from caring for their spouses so they experience fewer positive emotions

3648648 screening for depression during pregnancy is important for this population group given latinas high rates of fertility and births to single women particularly among more acculturated u s born latinas
3648649 the sample for this study was a low income population
3648650 our conclusions may or may not be different for women in other socioeconomic status ses groups hence more research needs to be conducted among latinas from differing ses groups including research focusing on the role of social support and cultural values beliefs related to childbirth and pregnancy among latinas
3648651 the higher prevalence rate of depression in americanized latina women is of concern in our community as the population demographics clearly indicate a significant rate of growth of this group in their childbearing years
3648652 thus it is important to more clearly understand the circumstances that affect their physical and emotional well being during pregnancy so that preventive measures can be initiated this is critical for the overall health of both the mother and child

3648659 its not like you live at fort hood or camp lejeune and everybody on your street is in the military
3648660 ringling bros engages in these unlawful activities by routinely beating elephants to train them discipline them and keep them under control chaining them for long periods of time hitting them with sharp bull hooks breaking baby elephants with force to make them submissive and forcibly removing nursing baby elephants from their mothers before they are weaned with the use of ropes and chains
3648661 i think its immoral to have elephants traveling in every arena in the country with tuberculosis
3648662 about half of the elephants in each of the shows had tuberculosis and that the tuberculosis was an easily transmitted disease to individuals to human beings
3648663 i undertook a series of efforts to find out what pottker was doing and reported on the results of my work to mr feld
3648664 i was paid for this work by feld entertainment or its affiliates i prepared my reports in writing and presented them to mr feld in personal meetings
3648665 i was also asked to review reports from feld executive vice president richard froemming and his organizations based on their surveillance of and efforts to counter the activities of various animal rights groups
3648666 immediately upon learning about negative stories about ringling bros the animal issues department will put in place the rapid deployment force
3648667 the animal issues department will directly contact the editor news director armed with videos literature and other information the animal issues department head will demand a retraction or equal time and will work in concert with the grass roots campaign if the editor news director refuses the request legal will be informed to determine what recourses exist
3648668 all of a sudden my hair wasnt good enough my makeup wasnt good enough after 25 years of doing the news
3648669 leslie worked here for a number of years and did a fantastic job
3648670 we stand behind the stories as they aired there was a whole lot of attention given to their accuracy
3648671 to shovel this stuff into the public record and try to draw inferences from it or put it in out of context lends itself to all sorts of abuse the very kind of abuse that we contend took place on the san francisco television station last week
3648672 you can talk about the animal abuse but with a worldwide epidemic brewing id say the story is the tuberculosis
3648673 there are several alarming issues for epidemiologists drug resistance inability to diagnose if an elephant has been cured and disease spreading to handlers who work with them and to the public who attend circus performances
3648674 i dont know that anyone has asked the question im not sure anyone has ever tied it together
3648675 every elephant traveling with ringling has been exposed to tb and many of them have tb
3648676 to find a physician who would test the people in the circus to see if they had tuberculosis but who would destroy the records and not turn them in to the centers for disease control
3648677 shedding is when it can be passed to other elephants
3648678 what our trunk washes look for is a shedding of the bacteria
3648679 however there has been no proven case of tuberculosis bacterium being transmitted from elephants to humans
3648680 none of the elephants in our traveling unit have ever tested positive for tb
3648681 no none of our traveling elephants have ever tested positive for tb
3648682 moved from cec to blue unit just finished tb treatment
3648683 the court requested that the parties not discuss the specifics of the suit
3648684 investigation regarding allegations that ringling was using known tb infected animals in circus performances
3648685 government sanctioned abuse how the united states department of agriculture allows ringling bros circus to systematically mistreat elephants
3648686 although tuberculosis is an extremely contagious disease and ringlings elephants are publicly exhibited throughout the country including elephants that go in and out of both the breeding and retirement facilities the public has been kept completely in the dark about this investigation the agencys decision to override the conclusions of its own inspectors and investigators and the reasons this investigation was closed with no further action
3648687 this cozy relationship between the usda and ringling bros is going to be exposed during the trial
3648688 the united states department of agricultures final report of investigation concerning the incident concluded that benjamins trainers use of an ankus on benjamin created behavioral stress and trauma which precipitated in the physical harm and ultimate death of the animal on information and belief the routine beatings of benjamin were a contributing factor to his death
3648689 suddenly and without any signs of distress or struggle benjamin became unconscious and drowned
3648690 things are pretty much done on a case by case basis we try to work with a facility to come into compliance
3648691 from the videos i have seen so much of it is repackaged and old stuff that doesnt apply to us at all not at all
3648692 i have never seen a trainer use an ankus inappropriately
3648693 the circus is really good at creating the illusion of the happy performing elephants
3648694 so were asking the judge to enjoin them to stop them from using these practices
3648695 it is our considered opinion that elephants should not be used in circuses elephants in the wild roam over large areas and move considerable distances each day they are intelligent highly social animals with a complex system of communication elephants in circuses are bought and sold separated from companions confined chained and forced to stand for hours and frequently moved about in small compartments on trains or trucks they are required to perform behaviors never seen in nature
3648696 i see elephants and get to see them all day doing the most amazingly athletic things
3648697 you can separate the ones who want to do it from the ones who dont want to do it
3648698 good for the feld family that they support elephants from their births to their deaths
3648699 to have this issue aired in a public forum will be helpful for educating the public
3648700 in no way did i imagine the bulk of the evidence that would support our claims
3648701 theres no humane way to have a circus with elephants because it has to travel year round
3648702 if you take away the chains and the bull hooks an elephant isnt going to do anything

3648743 for one blacktop stays hot and could continue to generate energy after the sun goes down unlike traditional solar electric cells
3648744 in addition there is already a massive acreage of installed roads and parking lots that could be retrofitted for energy generation so there is no need to find additional land for solar farms
3648745 finally unlike roof top solar arrays which some find unattractive the solar collectors in roads and parking lots would be invisible

3648753 najbolj pomembno je da je dokazala da je zrela plavalka v finalni tekmi bi kaj lahko psihi no pogorela tudi lani v melbournu na svetovnem prvenstvu ni bilo vse po dogovoru zdaj pa je dokazala da lahko plava svojo tekmo in se ne ozira na tekmice z dana njim nastopom je postala vrhunska tekmovalka
3648754 na igre sem pri el zelo iv en saj sem vedel za prilo nost a je lo na bolj e ko so tukaj nastopili prvi plavalci in dosegali osebne rekorde takrat sem vedel da smo dobro pripravljeni a se je nervoza v eraj in danes pred startom ponovila res mi je odleglo
3648755 sara je nase prvi opozorila na mladinskem evropskem prvenstvu v glasgowu leta 2003 ko je na 100 m prosto osvojila etrto mesto pozneje se je krivulja njenih uspehov obrnila navzgor e pred tem pa se je 100 odstotno odlo ila za port to je prineslo vse njene uspehe letos pa je bil napredek po naslovu na ep v eindhovnu velikanski

3648767 that is why i submit the moors in spain achieved such a high culture their fathers were born into a polygamous tradition but their mothers were the daughters of christians and jews and had spent their early years in an absolutely monogamous environment the sons of these women laid the foundations of rationalistic culture but soon the supply of christian and jewish women was insufficient so the incipient rationalism failed to mature greatly
3648768 a female emancipating movement is a cultural phenomenon of unfailing regularity it appears to be the necessary outcome of absolute monogamy the subsequent loss of social energy after the emancipation of women which is sometimes emphasized has been due not to the emancipation but to the extension of sexual opportunity which has always accompanied it in human records there is no instance of female emancipation which has not been accompanied by an extension of sexual opportunity
3648769 in terms of the number of students who are ready this year compared to last we are talking about genuine progress
3648770 more students are reaching at least a minimum level of readiness for college credit courses were keeping a lot of kids from having to take remedial level courses that translates to millions of dollars that are being saved at the state level
3648771 we have a more heterogeneous population of test takers so were including those kids who werent considering college or arent considering college

3648777 we are committed to providing a public payphone service however over the years usage has declined
3648778 bt has therefore been constantly reviewing and where necessary rationalising its public payphone estate in order to keep pace with demand
3648779 almost 60 per cent of our payphones are unprofitable with almost 6 000 phones making less than one call a month and more than 50 per cent making less than one call a week
3648780 this public phone is invaluable to people on a low income or those without a landline

3648799 im finding people are cancelling their meals because they cant afford them already they cant extend to 2 90 a time
3648800 theyre starting to worry about gas and electricity bills even now when its relatively warm its terribly sad but its a sign of the times
3648801 its not as though they are even cooking themselves something instead they might have a packet or something which is no nutritional value at all
3648802 donations have dropped but they always do in a recession
3648803 luckily this was obviously coming for a long time so we have budgeted for it but bills are going through the roof
3648804 at the end of the day we will go on for as long as we can but unless we get support from the general public we wont be going much longer
3648805 most church water bills will rise by hundreds or even thousands
3648806 i can assure you that russias international reputation and what role russia can play in the international community is very much at stake here
3648807 in the wake of this conflict there is no way that we can proceed with this joint exercise at this time

3648809 the low loaders delivering the pre fab buildings cannot access the prison through the gates but it is proposed that an alteration to the existing access will be made
3648810 also a new temporary road is to be made at the rear of buckley terrace which involves the removal of an existing wooden fence and using some of the land belonging to the terrace
3648811 this in turn will involve taking down established trees at the rear of the properties which will also spoil our outlook

3648813 we have got quite a lot of experience of amalgamation and mergers that may have been more complex than this
3648814 we have developed staff protocols that have been tried and tested
3648815 the table is important for us and i think we can consolidate our semi final position now
3648816 with two games to go we want to finish as high as we can and see if we can get a home draw
3648817 there were some good things out there against swinton we finished a little bit sloppy towards the back end but we had to make quite a few changes and we had four props out there one of them in the centre so overall i was quite happy
3648818 we were a little bit loose especially around the rucks but as i have said it didnt help that we had to make so many changes and we were a little bit disjointed
3648819 the main thing is we got the result and can now push on and have the confidence and momentum with us
3648820 martin ainscough is pushing up really well the team has a good work ethic at the moment we were pushing really hard so our support play has got a lot of bodies in motion and our halfbacks are turning breaks into tries
3648821 we have tightened up things a lot defensively and i thought we were very tough again our discipline has been a lot better with the ball
3648822 if we can get the two results i know york will be very very tough and skolars have run doncaster close we will be looking to continue our momentum
3648823 you never know once those finals start its a knockout thing and if you turn up on the day with the right attitude you can keep going through the competition and who knows what happens
3648824 it was a good performance and i was encouraged by it
3648825 it was just our finishing touches that let us down a bit because our passages of play were very good we just need to be a bit more ruthless
3648826 we had the lions share of the game and on another day wed have beaten them
3648827 i felt we could have been more clinical in front of goal
3648828 the performance merited more and on chances created and in terms of pressure we should have won the game
3648829 we did most of the foraging and the majority of the contest was played in the grimsby half
3648830 but weve got a point on the board and its a healthy start for us especially away from home
3648831 wir waren sehr gut vorbereitet aber mit zwei gro en fehlern kann man leider nicht gold gewinnen

3648840 it is shocking that so few countries consider it important even to count the number of animals suffering in their laboratories
3648841 it is impossible to have a clear and honest debate about the role of animal experiments in the 21st century when the official number of animals involved is outrageously underestimated
3648842 while we were satisfied that people were brought to account for their greedy deception the real loser here was the vulnerable victim who had been stripped of money she spent all her life saving up
3648843 people often forget one of the most traditional duties of a police officer we do not stop when thieves have been convicted the job is only done when victims get back what is rightfully theirs
3648844 it is greatly satisfying for me and the team that our hard work has paid off for such a deserving person
3648845 the victim in this case has always acted in good grace and with patience she reached the point where she accepted her loss when it would have been understandable to bear a grudge
3648846 she has had the opportunity to speak at will about those who conned her but has kept a dignified silence throughout
3648847 we are grateful for the care consideration and thoughtfulness that we experienced during the investigation and subsequent trial and conviction of these embezzlers
3648848 there was unexpected relief at the very good news that all of the money embezzled plus interest was to be repaid
3648849 oliver loves the fact that no one else can do what he does and it gives him a bit of kudos at school

3648851 but it is not just about racing it is also about discipline and focus
3648852 i am a bit of a petrol head myself and i think thats where he got it from

3648876 its a completely different side you lose a few games and you win some but after all you want to go out there you want to do and its not as if your players are not putting in the effort so we look to go out there and do our best what we can and we will try to give our best shot and we will try to perform according to our potential
3648877 to that end it was agreed that representatives who have attended the latest briefings and demonstrations in lahore and karachi will visit stakeholders who have expressed reservations to let them know of the safety and security measures on the ground
3648878 the results of those meetings will be fed back to me and also to icc vice president sharad pawar and icc ceo lorgat on august 20 so we can make a further assessment of the comfort levels of our participating members

3648894 it was a bad crisis for the world it required tough words but also a smart approach to call on the international community to step in and im very very happy that the senators request for a ceasefire has been complied with by president medvedev
3648895 while angells advice is everyday behavior for the overwhelming majority of people albeit without an awareness of the risks theyre taking in most cases its a radical notion at black hat
3648896 the philosophy was in these large natural areas fire should be allowed to play its role
3648897 what happened in 88 in yellowstone was probably a passing of the threshold with what the political and social world was comfortable with it was perceived that we were burning up their national park and there would be nothing left of it
3648898 every single day you couldnt believe that youd wake up and there was more fire new fires started
3648899 because people didnt understand it we didnt do a good enough job explaining it back then it became known as the let it burn policy
3648900 we learned a lot in 1988 about how much fire a park could take before they ran out of resources
3648901 i think the overriding message of our report was as big as these fires were and as important as they were in many ways they were not historically unprecedented and it was not unnatural
3648902 we very emphatically said and i think the 20 years since then have confirmed that the fires were not an ecological disaster
3648903 actually its a lot greener now hopefully we learned from that its ok to let nature do what it needs to do clean house
3648904 mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
3648905 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when the convention program will focus on renewing americas economy
3648906 im convinced that the national interest demands a new approach to our interaction with the world
3648907 part of it is political parties are a distant analog to families and you really hate to step outside a family environment
3648908 a single endorsement does not hide the fact that sen obama has no record of achievement beyond the confines of his party
3648909 while john mccain has spent his career putting the country first ahead of personal and party interests sen obamas record is a lesson in partisanship
3648910 his anti war posture might be attractive to obama but hes anathema to much of the progressive base of the democratic party
3648911 i think though it is impossible to predict with absolute confidence that the delegates would not deliver their votes unless at a minimum he switched political parties
3648912 mark warner is the future of the democratic party and putting him on tuesday night with hillary clinton is exactly right move for obama

3648939 were waiting to find out but there are so many leaders in the team and whoever it is im convinced will do a great job for the country
3648940 there will be a lot on their shoulders but they will do a great job jt and rio are both great players they are both top central defenders and both would be equally deserving of the captains armband if they got it as would steven gerrard as would david beckham to be honest
3648941 its not up to me to say who should get it but what i can say is that whoever gets it will have the 100 support of the lads and of the manager and of the whole country
3648942 its a very tough one for fabio capello to call but thats his job thats what he gets paid to do i imagine it will be a difficult decision so we just have to wait and see
3648943 my ambition is to play for my country and i think with aston villa i will have that possibility every player wants to play international football and that is my aim
3648944 this is the best league in the world and last year villa did very well they play very good football and had a fantastic season
3648945 so i am very happy to come here with the opportunity to play in the premier league we are also playing in europe this season so that will be good
3648946 i watched villa last season and martin oneill is a very good coach he plays exciting attacking football and i am excited to be here
3648947 i am flattered by celtics interest they are one of the biggest teams in the world and their fans are the best in the world
3648948 but newcastle have very good fans and i am flattered by their interest also but we have to wait it does not depend on me
3648949 there is so much that needs to be done for a transfer but a move to the united kingdom is the one i want to move my career forward
3648950 the premier league is appealing but celtic are the biggest team in scotland and are known everywhere so i dont know i love the united kingdom and that is all i can say
3648951 everybody at the club is looking forward to the occasion and it is a match that the players are keen to pit their wits against higher opposition
3648952 coventry have started their campaign on a good note with their win on saturday but we also won too and the players have grown in confidence out of that result
3648953 we are going to go up there and give it a go though because we have nothing to lose
3648954 the players will enter the match with no fear and many of them will draw on the experiences of last season where they had to produce in pressurised situations in the run in to winning the league
3648955 its a game that we can go out and enjoy we could get a result get a draw and take them to penalties who knows
3648956 its a game we want to win and well try and have a very good football match well be looking forward to it

3649161 i saw her on letterman once and bought her cd
3649162 in case you didnt get the previous hundred times weve mentioned it we are a green hotel got it
3649163 the philosophy was in these large natural areas fire should be allowed to play its role
3649164 what happened in 88 in yellowstone was probably a passing of the threshold with what the political and social world was comfortable with it was perceived that we were burning up their national park and there would be nothing left of it
3649165 every single day you couldnt believe that youd wake up and there was more fire new fires started
3649166 because people didnt understand it we didnt do a good enough job explaining it back then it became known as the let it burn policy
3649167 we learned a lot in 1988 about how much fire a park could take before they ran out of resources
3649168 i think the overriding message of our report was as big as these fires were and as important as they were in many ways they were not historically unprecedented and it was not unnatural
3649169 we very emphatically said and i think the 20 years since then have confirmed that the fires were not an ecological disaster
3649170 actually its a lot greener now hopefully we learned from that its ok to let nature do what it needs to do clean house
3649171 now if somebody wants to sue us they have an option to sue but im fairly certain that a judge will see it the way the way the citizens see it here
3649172 the citizens deserve peace that some infringement on constitutional rights is ok and we have not violated anything as far as the constitution
3649173 weve had people call us expressing concern for their children
3649174 they had to sleep on the floor because of stray bullets
3649175 the residents of these high crime areas are already victims
3649176 theyre victims of what are happening in the neighborhoods theyre victims of fear but for them to be subject to unlawful stops and questioning that is not going to ultimately going to help this situation
3649177 as far as im concerned at 3 oclock in the morning nobody has any business being on the street except the law
3649178 anyone out at 3 oclock shouldnt be out on the street unless youre going to the hospital
3649179 because many prostate cancers grow slowly early detection may not benefit a patients health and in some cases may even cause harm
3649180 we encourage men younger than 75 to discuss with their clinicians the potential but uncertain benefits and the possible harms of getting the psa test before they decide to be screened
3649181 i think people are feeling keenly that the economy is starting to slow down and things are getting more difficult
3649182 young people are sympathizing because they see themselves and todays situation in the novel
3649183 the sympathy is sporadic and i dont think it will lead to organized movements
3649184 things are different now from the stable employment conditions of japans period of high economic growth
3649185 life time employment is gone and its uncertain whether people will receive their pensions i think such insecurity attracts people to this text
3649186 the novels like a dream everyone uniting fighting and winning together
3649187 but i doubt well see that type of reaction now
3649188 wir gehen davon aus dass wir uns auch im zweiten halbjahr von der allgemein negativen branchenentwicklung abkoppeln k nnen
3649189 can you guess what these might have been used for and where
3649190 i think in the long run probably the death penalty is going to disappear in asia as it seems to be doing in many parts of the rest of the world
3649191 the most dramatic execution decreases occurred in the rapidly developing democracies of south korea and taiwan but declines have also occurred in nations such as india and malaysia
3649192 when development and plural democracy take root in asia the decline of the death penalty usually comes sooner rather than later
3649193 i will say that the frame that regards the death penalty as a human rights issue has become more conspicuous and salient in asia than it was in the past
3649194 and when you frame the death penalty as a human rights issue instead of a crime issue you invite anxiety and concern and resistance to the death penalty because after all its a state killing
3649195 i know it would be total coincidence if i didnt slice it into seven pieces and my family were killed in a fire
3649196 i understand that there could be no correlation but you know the guilt would be too much for me to bear so its easier for me to cut the stupid banana
3649197 because its much more pleasant to be obsessed over how the hero gets out of his predicament than it is over how i get out of mine
3649198 my mother always said i was a very cheerful kid until i was 5 years old and then i turned gloomy
3649199 now maybe i stayed in the crib longer than other kids
3649200 i dont prattle on about this at all to my daughters
3649201 i bend over backwards to be very positive and not in any way express this to them
3649202 i need to be focused on something so i dont see the big picture
3649203 i was never bothered if a film was not well received
3649204 but the converse of that is that i never get a lot of pleasure out of it if it is so it isnt like you can say hes an uncompromising artist thats not true im a compromising person definitely its that i dont get much from either side
3649205 this can happen and this is a nice thing but when you leave the theater youre still going back out into a very cruel world
3649206 its like the beginning of stardust memories the trains all go to the same place
3649207 your perception of time changes as you get older because you see how brief everything is
3649208 you see how meaningless i dont want to depress you but its a meaningless little flicker
3649209 you have a meal or you listen to a piece of music and its a pleasurable thing
3649210 the feeling you come away with is to have had a nice time to have been in the presence of a pretty city and pretty people and thats fine but when you step back and analyze the details it is pessimistic
3649211 i once thought there was a good argument between whether its worth it to make a film where you confront the human condition or an escape film
3649212 you could argue that the fred astaire film is performing a greater service than the bergman film because bergman is dealing with a problem that youre never going to solve whereas fred astaire you walk in off the street and for an hour and half theyre popping champagne corks and making light banter and you get refreshed like a lemonade

3649219 were not saying diablo iii is the end of the diablo universe but we are trying to bring this storyline to a close
3649220 we also tried to focus a little more on bringing characters back and not just from diablo ii but from diablo i
3649221 people can expect to see characters from diablo i more characters from diablo ii and characters from some of the books
3649222 harapan saya penyelesaian ini akan membantu para korban dan keluarga mereka memulai penyembuhan dan melangkah maju
3649223 saya hari ini kembali meminta maaf kepada para korban dan keluarga mereka serta kepada seluruh komunitas katolik kita harus terus melakukan dengan segenap kemampuan kita untuk memastikan keselamatan anak anak yang kita asuh
3649224 saat disiksa saya tidak bisa berbuat banyak saya pun tak tahu berapa orang yang melakukan penganiyaan karena matanya ditutup dengan lakban mulut juga tidak bisa berteriak karena juga ditutup
3649225 saya tidak tahu lagi apa yang dilakukan polisian terhadap saya karena sakitnya penganiyaan yang mereka lakukan malamnya itu sudah tidak dapat saya rasakan lagi saya hanya terkulai lemas tapi tak lama kemudian saya disetrum
3649226 my life is going in a direction that i have always wanted
3649227 it was steve mcqueens claustrophobic installation western deep that journeyed down into a south african gold mine that put a lid on any aspirations to gold jewellery i might have had yet with bling still adorning the fashion and rock fraternity perhaps these photographs by richard wainwright and annie bungeroth might find them opting for macram instead hard hitting it reveals the destructive power of intensive mining and the cycle of poverty and violence that follows yet there is hope images of communities fighting back reveal a powerful human spirit in the face of total annihilation

3649232 where there is evidence of criminal wrongdoing we vigorously investigate it and where there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime we vigorously prosecute
3649233 but not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime

3649235 their misconduct has now been laid bare by the justice department for all to see

3649242 now if somebody wants to sue us they have an option to sue but im fairly certain that a judge will see it the way the way the citizens see it here
3649243 the citizens deserve peace that some infringement on constitutional rights is ok and we have not violated anything as far as the constitution

3649251 what happened in 88 in yellowstone was probably a passing of the threshold with what the political and social world was comfortable with it was perceived that we were burning up their national park and there would be nothing left of it

3649257 actually its a lot greener now hopefully we learned from that its ok to let nature do what it needs to do clean house
3649258 we have a sport carnival coming up and weve all been inspired by you to do our best
3649259 dont give up and down slow down because youre getting close to your goal keep going right through
3649260 we dont know our future because we have no facilities to offer
3649261 we are sick of dragging everything around the land is allocated and we dont want a big facility
3649262 shall be for the purpose of facilitating the development and management of a surf lifesaving club
3649263 the city is committed to the needs of both surf life saving clubs as both clubs are important service providers within mandurah with equally important needs for facilities
3649264 we want to build appropriate multi purpose facilities in both locations that serve both the needs of the surf life saving clubs and the wider community
3649265 its an ongoing issue and just a matter of getting funding im more than happy to assist the club
3649266 mandurah is one of the oldest clubs without a facility
3649267 we believe were fairly close to getting land vested back to council were working on it
3649268 the city of mandurah along with surf life saving wa used the 2007 year of the life saver to promote the community service contribution of both clubs and the need for facilities
3649269 we would have so much more to offer if we had a clubhouse
3649270 endorse a development with a maximum of two stories in height which is in context with its surroundings without creating an immediate or future negative impact on the local environment
3649271 people have worked hard to preserve the dunes and a lot of replanting has been done
3649272 sand is already being blown around near homes and this will only be increased if the development goes ahead
3649273 these include shadows on the beach in the mornings shadows on surrounding homes in the afternoon loss of privacy to those homes and reflection from the glass
3649274 if this goes ahead there will be a loss of amenity for the surf beach it is one of the best surf beaches from perth to bunbury
3649275 we dont oppose developments in general but this one is just too high
3649276 the suburb is all low rise and the development is out of context with whats there
3649277 heise de mit berarbeitetem layout und rabatte f r werbekunden wieso denn so was
3649278 we believe it would have been far better if kpmg had contacted our members to check the accuracy or otherwise of data and at least get their views
3649279 we think it a reasonable proposition that the industry would have at least been consulted and asked for input into the report
3649280 vodafone rejects the kpmg report because it is selectively modelled on out of date information

3649291 angefangen von den zugangsbeschr nkungen bis hin zu der freigabe der studienbeitr ge f r ausl ndische studierende sowie der entmachtung des senats sind nahezu alle behandelten punkte dieser gesetzesvorlage f r uns absolut inakzeptabel

3649293 im zuge der bologna umstellung wurde unter anderem komplett darauf vergessen die toleranzsemester anzupassen momentan haben studierende in einem bachelorstudium lediglich ein toleranzsemester in anbetracht der g nzlich berladenen studienpl ne ist das viel zu wenig wir fordern daher mindestens zwei toleranzsemester
3649294 der bachelor ist momentan ein absolutes novum am sterreichischen arbeitsmarkt es w re in der jetzigen situation absolut unverantwortlich die studierenden allein mit diesem abschluss von der uni in die arbeitswelt zu werfen
3649295 eingangsphasen mit killerpr fungen sind f r viele studierende leider heute schon zum traurigen alltag geworden dieser praxis muss ein ende bereitet werden wir hoffen die verantwortlichen begreifen dass man hohe qualit t nicht mit beschr nkungen erreichen kann
3649296 minister hahn fordert eine zunehmende internationalisierung der sterreichischen studierenden was durchaus begr enswert ist f r uns stellt sich jedoch die frage welcher studierende noch freiwillig ins ausland geht wenn ihm pr fungen hierzulande nur unter gr ten widerst nden wenn berhaupt angerechnet werden hier muss dringend abhilfe geschaffen werden

3649322 the winning bag design answered our brief deftly with a witty sophisticated and intelligent drawing that captured the exclusive books brand perfectly the na ve line drawing was simple playful and unusual and added a touch of whimsy to the exclusive books brand
3649323 there was a wonderful variety of work submitted showcasing a wealth of talent and different perspectives there were designs of an extremely high standard as well as ideas and approaches that are fresh and engaging
3649324 ideas do matter exclusive books is in the business of ideas at the cutting edge of culture our books are so often the catalyst for great things entries to the plastic bag competition proved how even a retailer can inspire imagination and we were delighted that our shopping bags are the moving billboards for creative talent in south africa

3649326 sentiment in the aussie of course has been very weak for the last two weeks since the rba reserve bank of australia suggested they are likely to shift to cutting interest rates
3649327 im actually still very nervous because of the fact that at the end of the day the market is still quite long aussie and the question is are there a lot more accounts that need to offload it
3649328 there were a lot of speculative positions being taken off the table because a lot of japanese traders had been heavily long aussie yen and also kiwi yen
3649329 those are starting to hurt and we are seeing quite a rapid unwinding of that leading to aussie dollar coming under some pretty decent pressure
3649330 the tibetan protesters were in the park john ray was running behind them the police was running behind him
3649331 we always had security arrangements in place even before they could fully start the demonstration we had them under control

3649339 i dont want my tournament to end in the next match i want to do the best that i possibly can
3649340 i might not have grown up in the best environment but i was supported by everyone around me that is how i get these great results
3649341 it is because of them that i am able to get this far

3649346 the increase in oil and commodity prices is damaging corporate profits
3649347 the fundamentals of the economy are much better than in the previous post bubble cycles

3649353 i have ordered reinstatement with conditions to balance united group nzs concerns as to how reinstatement in the short term could be accommodated with mr edmunds arguable case that his dismissal was unjustified
3649354 i accept at face value mr edmunds expressed desire to return to work at united group nz and his concern about maintaining his reputation in the business community there is no evidence of financial hardship
3649355 if that is the case and we have humanitarian access australia as always will be in there through the appropriate international agencies including the red cross to provide practical humanitarian help
3649356 australians expect our government always to be out there with a helping hand when people are in need and there are something like 100 000 displaced persons im advised in this particular war zone in georgia
3649357 australia of course stands ready to contemplate humanitarian assistance there have been a large number of civilians who have been killed or injured or displaced
3649358 at officer level in new york through the un georgia approached a number of countries for military assistance
3649359 our response was of course the obvious which is we are not interested in a military solution here were interested in ceasefire and a dialogue so that was made very clear

3649673 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3649674 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3649675 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3649676 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3649677 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3649678 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3649679 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3649690 they told me when i got here that i couldnt burn incense and i couldnt get any oils because only wiccans can get oils so i said well ill sign up for a wiccan

3649703 when i first got involved with the play i thought how wonderful but surely they wont have us walking around naked
3649704 then it became clear we would but the director has told us not to worry it will all come together and will be sensitively done
3649705 the good thing is we are all playing women who have to get over their embarrassment about taking their clothes off for the calendar and thats how we feel ourselves

3649708 of all the housemates he wants to be here the least and when someone does feel that way it makes it harder to get on with them in the house
3649709 she doesnt actually say some things she makes you feel uncomfortable with the way she is acting its all a game she creates rows i think
3649710 i just dont really agree with the way he stuart handles things especially today being nasty and stirring up little comments
3649711 i dont think he deserves to be here the way he keeps going on about how he wants to go home
3649712 she looked so fragile and tiny like a little girl lost
3649713 she is meant to have all these pals as part of her entourage but sometimes she just seems to be small and alone obviously people around her think she needs close watching and that a bit of help is needed when she comes out of the house
3649714 for those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh but those who live according to the spirit set their minds on the things of the spirit for to set the mind on the flesh is death but to set the mind on the spirit is life and peace for the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to god for it does not submit to gods law indeed it cannot
3649715 i kept on telling my staff im worried about hawaii
3649716 its going to be really embarrassing if we dont pull it out i think i need to spend two or three days campaigning they said no
3649717 in august 1924 the small nation of georgia occupied by soviet russia since 1921 rose up against soviet rule
3649718 unlikely was an understatement georgians did not enjoy freedom again until 1991
3649719 the free and independent social democratic state of georgia will always remain in my memory as a classic example of an imperialist small nation both in territory snatching outside and bureaucratic tyranny inside its chauvinism was beyond all bounds
3649720 in the hope of avoiding a proliferation of an unpredictable number of small states the international community in its collective wisdom decreed that it would recognize only the ussrs constituent union republics and would thus not give any encouragement to the yearning for self determination that characterized some ethnic minorities living in regions endowed with only lower level autonomy according to the soviet administrative system such as the autonomous republic of abkhazia and the autonomous region of south ossetia both lower status entities within the union republic of soviet georgia it was a huge irony that in adopting this stance the west was effectively enshrining the divisions created for his fiefdom by none other than the soviet dictator iosep besarionis dze dzhughashvili a georgian known to the wider world as joseph vissarionovich stalin
3649721 had the soviet union collapsed during the first decade of its existence in the 1920s before abkhazia was reduced in status by fiat of stalin in february 1931 from being a fully fledged republic which entered the transcaucasian federation on 13 december 1922 in treaty alliance with georgia to that of an autonomous republic within georgia and had the then league of nations adopted the same principle of recognition later practiced by its successor the united nations then abkhazia would for decades have enjoyed independence and membership in its own right of the said international community
3649722 the aggressive politics of the government of georgia towards abkhazia occasioned extreme displeasure among the local abkhazian armenian russian greek and a significant proportion of the kartvelian peoples which actually helped to facilitate the establishment of soviet power in the region on march 4th 1921
3649723 as a deliverance from the repression and meddling of the georgian republic
3649724 the politics of this state was quite accurately characterized by one of its eminent activists the jurist internationalist zurab avalov avalishvili in his book the independence of georgia in international politics 1918 1921 paris 1924 he remarked at the start of 1921 georgia had in the person of its government and in the shape of the constituent assembly a simple creature of party organization georgian democracy 1917 1921 a form of social democratic dictatorship i e of the right wing of marxism was a period of preparation for the triumph in georgia of soviet dictatorship

3649803 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3649804 the georgians have agreed to a cease fire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3649805 the idea is to show the russians that it is no longer business as usual
3649806 countries that neighbor russia will think deeply about how to protect themselves how to guarantee security
3649807 the ability and the readiness to use force that russia has demonstrated shows that russia is a very serious power now
3649808 our neighbor thinks it can fight us we are telling it no
3649809 the aggressor has been punished and sustained very serious losses
3649810 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions
3649811 our position is that mr saakashvili can no longer be our partner

3649821 the militants believe that the shia officials are from the badr militia who are trained and strongly directed by iran with of course the knowledge of the americans
3649822 the militants now sahwa members kept blocking import of goods from iran
3649823 they shot the shopkeepers who dealt with them so it was rare to see iranian chocolate or anything else with the partial government control by the shia especially in the last six months shopkeepers are now allowed to deal in iranian goods
3649824 if the u s launches an assault on iran ill be the first volunteer to fight on the side of the u s
3649825 iran enjoys influence through the men of the united iraqi alliance in the baghdad government as represented by the supreme islamic iraqi council siic and the dawa party
3649826 the governor made a deal to import cooking oil from iran at a very high price that has never been seen before
3649827 i think the iranian influence will remain as long as there are such men as the governor raad rashid jawad in the province
3649828 the province was and still is the worst because of this corrupt administration
3649829 the iraqi government gives 5 million dollars per month to the iranian side to cover the cost of the electricity to diyala province
3649830 we dont have a representative government here or in baghdad because of the heavy iranian influence
3649831 that influence favours only those who support them and injures those of us who do not
3649832 the badr militia and all their political and religious leaders entered iraq on the backs of the american tanks

3649875 with the inevitable rise in inflation in tandem with the spike in energy and commodity prices the long period of low and stable interest rates is coming to an end
3649876 in a rising interest rate environment one way would be to switch from the conventional loan linked to floating blr to a fixed interest plan in which the interest rate will remain constant throughout a loan tenure
3649877 the main advantage of such a plan is that it allows borrowers to plan their monthly budgets instead of worrying about whether their expenses will increase due to market vagaries
3649878 this was even before the whopping increase in fuel prices and electricity tariffs which resulted in bond yields and swap rates rising by more 25 to 30 basis points overnight
3649879 the priority now is for the growth momentum to stay intact particularly given the slowdown of the global economy and that has to be underpinned by a low interest rate regime
3649880 a critic must write well care about books and possess good taste and good sense if his prose is slipshod or dull if ideology means more to him than style if he claims to admire bad or mediocre books he loses the thoughtful readers respect and while celebration makes for the best criticism negative reviews in the right hands can be turned into the mirror image of celebration and usually offer more opportunities for laughs

3649918 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3649919 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3649920 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3649921 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3649922 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3649923 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3649924 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3649925 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3649926 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3649927 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3649928 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3649929 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3649949 lets hear from the two project leaders russ you are from the engineering department how do you understand your role
3649950 and corey you represent the production department how do you understand your role
3649951 and sometimes there is a conflict in russs quality agenda and coreys production agenda
3649952 and that is what we are here to resolve today the conflict between russ and corey

3649957 wayne rooney carlos tevez ryan giggs they have all been fantastic
3649958 i think we can close the gap because man united were at the very top of their game last season
3649959 but weve been very close to them and we had injuries and a change of manager
3649960 the new manager has come in and made a few changes hes made some great signings deco looks awesome so im excited to see him play
3649961 we need to start well and get off to a flyer just keep winning
3649962 man united have a few tough games early on liverpool have made some good signings and will be stronger this year we need to focus

3649967 it is now up to the governor to keep his commitment by fully funding the algebra i success initiative

3649993 we are committed to a safe and secure event in pakistan
3649994 we believe these visits and the feedback we get from them will play a major role in us achieving those ends
3649995 during the recently completed asia cup there were no fixtures at rawalpindi and that didnt allow us the opportunity to check the security arrangements so there has been no way for us to formulate an opinion on the venue
3649996 we believe that by excluding rawalpindi and using just two venues both of them successful hosts during the asia cup it will remove doubt allow a further concentration of resources and thus improve comfort levels for all stakeholders in the event
3649997 as the icc our aim is to ensure we have a safe and successful event that is enjoyed by everyone following our great game of cricket
3649998 what is clear from our visit is that there is a huge desire within pakistan as well as significant resources to that aim into a reality
3649999 nobody seems to want to remember the fact that we had so many successes and come from behind victories in this campaign and they are due in large part to senator clintons leadership
