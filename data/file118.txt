1180062 i cant say in all 16 pilot villages that everything ended happily but the initial friction and resentment gave way to a recognition of the benefits
1180063 at first i didnt get why we should open up our government resources to share with these ngos i mean that was originally the governments money why should we give it to them

1180091 a lot of merchants in the restaurant industry are kind of monitoring their orders so they dont have too much in the refrigerator or freezer that could go bad
1180092 this is the nirvana of what weve been talking about for years

1180107 most boat owners are moving loose debris putting out extra bumpers doubling lines checking batteries and topping off freshwater in case something happens with the water lines here

1180116 it helps us get at who is getting infected now what we call the leading edge of the epidemic as opposed to the tailing edge of those who have been infected for a long time
1180117 will be very useful to the community and health department to direct prevention resources to where they are needed now
1180118 we dont know whether the number will be higher or lower
1180119 the number we come up with in the next couple of weeks will be the number well be able to compare it to in the coming years to see whether the epidemic is going up going down or staying stable
1180120 fuck the people we have to save our own asses
1180121 its very important that the speaker come back bring this house back into session and do the responsible thing which is to increase the independence of the united states with respect to petroleum

1180127 for some time it has been the practice of the state to openly notoriously and proudly give away state funds for economic development and other unauthorized purposes such as promotion of agriculture
1180128 the results of the flagrant disregard of the constitutional ban on gifts to private firms are precisely the set of evils the original ban was designed to prevent high taxes enormous debt a rising deficit economic stagnation and a state government dominated by special interest groups and oblivious to the interest of the people as a whole
1180129 multiple u s officials told the associated press that former army scientist bruce ivins was long obsessed with the sorority kappa kappa gamma going back as far as his own college days at the university of cincinnati the bizarre link to the sorority may indirectly explain one of the biggest mysteries in the case why the anthrax was mailed from princeton n j 195 miles from the army biological weapons lab the anthrax is believed to have been smuggled out of

1180131 it was alexander solzhenitsyn who opened the eyes of the world to the reality of the soviet system giving a universal reach to his experience
1180132 his intransigence his ideals and his long eventful life make of solzhenitsyn a storybook figure heir to dostoyevsky
1180133 he belongs to the pantheon of world history i pay homage to his memory
1180134 will be remembered as an intellectual who provided us with a testimony tinged with suffering and a sharp and accurate view on the tragedies of 20th century totalitarianism

1180136 one of the greatest european writers of the 20th century an author who contributed to changing the course of history
1180137 with his descriptions of the prison camps he opened the eyes of many on the left and forced them to reconsider communism
1180138 a central character in the tragic history of 20th century
1180139 on days like today we have a duty to remember him and his commitment to russia
1180140 solzhenitsyn was a great writer and a moral witness bringing the evils of the gulag to the attention of the world
1180141 his brave and arduous lifes journey which included surviving the gulag internal and external exile made him one of the 20th centurys most important voices in the struggle against the tyranny of totalitarian regimes

1180143 for chinese intellectuals he was a master of literature and for others who suffered in the 1960s and 1970s he was a thinker with a deep sense of justice and morality who pitilessly attacked the crimes of the soviet dictatorship

1180149 the truth is that mccains campaign has received 1 33 million from individuals employed in the oil and gas industry not 2 million

1180152 im sad about the conversation you chose to publish regarding myself and alon her son who volunteered a comment when i was videotaping his mom about t d
1180153 out of all the conversations we had i would have written more along the positive impact t d is having on the black community the spiritual community there are a lot of things i think i could have focused on versus the ears
1180154 do you think that when you write something along those lines that could have an impact on for example my sons interaction with his uncle
1180155 some people get to a point in their lives when they think they are so high and mighty you should genuflect to them i dont think this is tony dungy i think this is his family its just ears
1180156 please dont try and tear a class act like garnett down

1180166 my son was crossing the street and a car came but he was running fast and the car honked
1180167 my son was very active he liked to go to the park he liked to run he was a good son
1180168 the truck dragged the baby he had jeans on the jeans were no longer on him when the ambulance got there
1180169 he was struck and somehow or another in being struck you know was run over by the rear tires of the truck
1180170 he should put himself in my shoes i feel the inexplicable pain of losing a son
1180171 the beginning of august is typically the hottest part of the year
1180172 we had a fantastic july but as soon as august first came around the bottom just dropped out
1180173 traditionally a vacation time people want to get a couple of weeks away before kids go back to school
1180174 august in washington the town empties out and people go on vacation
1180175 a lot of the inquiries ive gotten have been like beach house and things that are close by in terms of driving distance
1180176 the details are being worked out with the doctors this week but the tentative plan is for radiation and chemotherapy
1180177 there are also recommendations made against the director of surgery dr almehdi who is currently overseas
1180178 the third person involved that will require further investigation by queensland health and or the medical board was the former executive director of medical services dr margetts
1180179 that was the big gap that occurred in his transference from victoria to queensland in the first place
1180180 that the college of surgeons although that they knew there were concerns about khalifallas performance didnt pass that information on in a timely way
1180181 we certainly are very willing to sit down with queensland health and consider how this could potentially be used
1180182 but we would see it as a relatively blunt instrument and it certainly shouldnt be a substitute for sophisticated error reporting systems
1180183 it would be far better to have excellent clinical audit systems that do not rely on subjective impressions
1180184 particularly when you may well have a small hospital with only one doctor wheres the other doctor to dob them in wheres the other doctor who has the expertise perhaps to judge your area of competency
1180185 there will be lots of scientific data taken from this
1180186 plug in hybrids are perhaps not good for all areas s tates that are heavily coal that equation doesnt work out very well for the environment
1180187 oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
1180188 it is unlikely that we can meet our aggressive climate goals if we eliminate nuclear power as an option
1180189 im the type of person that if you say to me that you cant do this then it makes me more determined anyway
1180190 but aside from what happened four years ago its just been one nightmare after another
1180191 when each one comes it hits you its like a punch in the stomach and you are down on the floor but fighting it does give you a bit of energy as well to have come this far gives you a boost and more confidence that things are going to go well
1180192 you can see a little bit out into the woods but i have totally knackered my ipod shuffle
1180193 i wouldnt be here if i didnt think i was in good enough shape i know from what i have done that i am good enough to be on the start line
1180194 everything has been on adapted treadmills there has been a bit of running outside i havent added it up but the volume has been more than normal because some of it has been cross training to put that endurance base there
1180195 probably the hardest thing is that i enjoy running its what i like doing and being stuck inside on a treadmill or on gym equipment doesnt give you the same enjoyment
1180196 but its given me some extra toughness in the closing stages of new york i was thinking about all the time i spent in the pool training and thats nothing compared to what ive done this time outside of running im racing unless my leg breaks down and i cant run thats it that has already been decided
1180197 the consistent point of contact was alan storey uk athletics endurance performance manager and i felt it was best to continue like that so that it did not become personal and emotional

1180203 yahoo did not participate in the execution of the votes and was not a party to any errors which may have been made either by a voting institution or a proxy processing intermediary acting on behalf of banks brokers and institutions
1180204 i guess jerry yang didnt come out of the meeting as unscathed as it seemed
1180205 we were surprised at the very high vote counts that were pro jerry yang
1180206 certainly the final results seemed very different from the exit polls
1180207 the independent inspector of elections certified the results of the election and yahoo accurately announced those results
1180208 yahoo did participate in the execution of the votes and was not a party to any errors which may have been made either by a voting institution or a proxy processing intermediary acting on behalf of banks brokers and institutions
1180209 capital research global investors asked broadridge financial to double check the votes it transmitted to yahoo on its behalf
1180210 i think jerry yang is still firmly in place until some deviation happens from the plan yahoo has set forth
1180211 i thought it was really really beautiful and very healing
1180212 it brought tears to my eyes thinking that i am legally entitled to marry this wonderful couple but i am not entitled to have the same joy in my own life
1180213 gay friends rang to tell me about it they were horrified and really annoyed we all felt it was so wrong to grab all the benefits that marriage gives you and just make a little statement to calm your guilt
1180214 it was that partnership that showed ducky how it is possible to survive stresses and strains of having two people fit together if she didnt have that example i dont think we would be marrying today
1180215 we went to great pains to ensure that our vows were gender neutral because we wanted to get married in a way that anyone could follow
1180216 with gods assistance to be onto you always a loving and faithful partner
1180217 ultimately im happy for anyone who finds the right person
1180218 i totally understand that but my own wedding just made me more determined to get those rights extended to everyone
1180219 im praying this little story doesnt jump the pond especially as the later summer slow news cycle sets in
1180220 lets hope that doesnt get picked up by some sc tourist and brought back it would be a classic case of a picture doing the damage of a thousand words
1180221 imagine my surprise in seeing this poster in a london underground station
1180222 reclaim the term so gay as a term that is rendered strongly positive for lesbian and gay people it also allows gay and lesbian people to feel that the term is being neutered as a negative putdown by portraying so gay as they experience it to be a very good thing indeed for gay consumers and for each destination highlighted
1180223 as you can see the images are very powerful and work well together
1180224 we were going through the process and beginning to look at taking action
1180225 we didnt think it was something that we needed to make a big deal out of
1180226 south carolina is a tremendous tourism product it appeals to a broad group of people

1180233 i wanted to do something to help because i was sad to see people walking around in 35 degree weather in mud water and through the streets with no shoes on their feet
1180234 we certainly live in tough economic times but we are also citizens of the world and capable of helping our underprivileged brothers and sisters in the motherland
1180235 i am humbly asking all my queens neighbors and people of goodwill across the city to make a donation
1180236 i look forward to working with all of our neighborhood partners to ensure that the

1180242 we now have six months to file our statement of use for the trademark and will decide what we will do during that time
1180243 we have and will continue to conduct appropriate due diligence around adoption and use of this trademark to ensure we do not infringe on anyone elses intellectual property
1180244 if parents teach their kids and get the kids to think before they make bad decisions due to repercussions they wouldnt do it
1180245 can talk more about sex and more about how to prevent just not tell us not to do it
1180246 the culture of young men who have sex with men is towards having more partners what they need to do is have fewer partners
1180247 its an issue that affects everybody regardless of age race how much money you make
1180248 we give out condoms and things that people can practice safe sex with give out information about hiv aids and stds and where you can come and get tested
1180249 i definitely take precautions to make sure i am safe and my friends are too
1180250 i always stress through education educate yourself learn dont be afraid because youre only afraid of what you dont know
1180251 the chancellor loves the pizza at lucalis and recommends it liberally to department of education staffers
1180252 id save a sentence or two at a time a paragraph here a paragraph there and it became something i worked on obsessively for six months
1180253 when the parents came home their jaws would open up youre writing a book on your phone they couldnt believe it
1180254 i can hear the baby im taking care of ill be back
1180255 he has the greatest nose ive ever seen and his lips are just perfect
1180256 i saw somebody sell a cornflake in the shape of a state on ebay for 1 000
1180257 i wanted people to have a place where they could really be comfortable for not a lot of money
1180258 but its been a nice surprise its clean and it has office space
1180259 the dorms are quite big compared to other hostels ive stayed in
1180260 id love a bar you see all the cool kids hanging around the neighborhood it makes sense
1180261 its a complete waste to have trucks parked along one of the most beautiful views in the entire world
1180262 they own a lot of waterfront property much of it being used for facilities that do not need to be on the water everything from salt piles to tow pounds to plain old storage
1180263 it impacts all of us it means that the facilities at mccarren park become overused it means ballfields in mccarren end up turning into dirt fields it means that much more garbage strewn around
1180264 its okay for them to build these huge condos on the waterfront but there should also be open parkland so everyone can run walk cycle and walk their dogs
1180265 we provide enterprise management for the complete infrastructure whether virtualized or non virtualized
1180266 rather than just using xenserver specific management tools at the hypervisor we manage physical hosts virtual guests and anything else thats hooked up to the environment including mainframes databases clouds and saas software as a service
1180267 are not as friendly for production infrastructures that have a high rate of change which you typically see in infrastructures with virtualization
1180268 eighty five percent of our end users update their production level systems more than once a week
1180269 servers have physically been designed to handle one environment and the i o that goes with it including interfaces to storage and the network they arent optimized to run multiple environments simultaneously so when you run lots of different environments on a single server you have the potential for them to conflict with one another as they try to get to storage and network resources and thats a real bottleneck
1180270 not really efficient enough so you need something like 3leaf
1180271 how can they be a real church if they dont have a pastor or elders
1180272 how can they be a legitimate church they arent under the authority of church officers or a presbytery
1180273 those throughout the world that profess the true religion together with their children
1180274 thence through the vicissitudes of time and succession the ordination of bishops and the business of the church move on so that the church is founded on the bishops and every act of the church is governed by these same rulers
1180275 whence you ought to know that the bishop is in the church and the church in the bishop and that if anyone is not with the bishop he is not in the church
1180276 the bishop is in the church and the church in the bishop and that if anyone is not with the bishop he is not in the church
1180277 he cannot have god as father who has not the church as mother
1180278 not in any single bishop but in the collective episcopate
1180279 brought out for the first time with anything like clearness and distinctness the idea of a catholic church comprehending all the true branches of the church of christ and bound together by a visible and external unity
1180280 are more or less pure according as the doctrine of the gospel is taught and embraced ordinances administered and public worship performed more or less purely in them
1180281 the term church is frequently employed in scripture to denote the body of believers in any particular place associated together in the worship of god
1180282 true saying if a man desire the office of a bishop he desires a good work
1180283 made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant
1180284 you should do as i have done to you verily verily i say unto you the servant is not greater than his lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy are you if you do them
1180285 not merely to ecclesiastical censure but to the whole of the powers and functions exercised by ecclesiastical office bearers and to all the judgments or decisions pronounced by them in the exercise of these powers
1180286 my little children of whom i travail in birth again until christ be formed in you
1180287 call no man your father upon the earth for one is your father which is in heaven
1180288 try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world
1180289 synagogue s of satan which say they are jews and are not
1180290 w ould to god they had the courage to gather in the name of jesus christ wherever they are and set up some sort of church either in their houses or in those of their neighbors to do in their place what we do here
1180291 whether it be right in the sight of god to hearken unto you more than unto god you judge we ought to obey god rather than men
1180292 but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed as we said before so say i now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that you have received let him be accursed
1180293 i fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled eve through his subtlety so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in christ for if he that comes preaches another jesus whom we have not preached or if you receive another spirit which you have not received or another gospel which you have not accepted you might well bear with him
1180294 examine yourselves whether you be in the faith prove your own selves
1180295 the church of the living god the pillar and ground of the truth
1180296 in particular circumstances when perfect regularity in regard to outward arrangements is impracticable or virtually so
1180297 suddenly finding the pope to be the devils agent and the miracle of the mass the most evil moment in their earthly experience
1180298 was moved with compassion on them because they fainted and were scattered abroad as sheep having no shepherd
1180299 the harvest truly is plenteous but the laborers are few pray therefore the lord of the harvest that he will send forth laborers into his harvest
1180300 thence through the changes of times and successions the ordering of bishops and the plan of the church flow onwards so that the church is founded upon the bishops and every act of the church is controlled by these same rulers
1180301 if anyone could escape who was outside the ark of noah then he also may escape who shall be outside the church
1180302 he can no longer have god for his father who has not the church for his mother
1180303 the visible church which is also catholic or universal under the gospel not confined to one nation as before under the law consists of all those throughout the world that profess the true religion together with their children unto this catholic visible church christ has given the ministry oracles and ordinances of god for the gathering and perfecting of the saints in this life to the end of the world and does by his own presence and spirit according to his promise make them effectual thereunto
1180304 wherever this gospel is truthfully and purely preached there is the kingdom of christ and this mark of the church or the kingdom of christ cannot deceive you for wherever the word is there the holy spirit is either in the hearer or in the teacher external works can deceive since after all they are found even among the heathen therefore the papacy errs in holding that there are marks of the church other than the word for the word has ever been the one constant and infallible mark of the church
1180305 the only mark of the christian church is following and obeying the word when that is gone let men boast as much as they please church church there is nothing to their boasting anyway therefore you should say do the people have the word of god there and do they accept it too wherever one hears the word of god there is the church of god though it be in a cow stable the place where christ was born
1180306 wheresoever then these former notes are seen and of any time continue be the number of persons never so few about two or three there without all doubt is the true kirk of christ who according to his promise is in the midst of them
1180307 when the courts of the church convene they function judicially they are courts they are not ecclesiastical congresses assembled to enact churchly legislation their function is to adjudicate matters based upon biblical law as judges the elders are not free to decide cases according to personal whim or the feelings of a moment rather the elders must render judgment according to the principles of gods word this is precisely what the apostles and elders did in acts 15 based upon gods written word in amos 9 11 12 cited in acts 15 16 17 the heretical doctrine of the judaizers is repudiated the decrees of the assembly are derived from the scriptures
1180308 by the source of it or by the authority of the lord jesus christ the head of the church from whom it is derived
1180309 by the rule prescribed for its exercise or by the word of god
1180310 by the subjects of it or by the rights privileges and liberty of the christian people
1180311 rebuke not an elder but entreat him as a father and the younger men as brethren the elder women as mothers the younger as sisters with all purity
1180312 lay hands suddenly on no man neither be partaker of other mens sins
1180313 low fat indicates that fat is there but just now in excess answer a is completely fat free so thats why b is the right choice it is confusing though im sure that wording in nursing school will make my life very hard
1180314 the cause of suffering is craving and to stop craving is to stop suffering
1180315 the buddha often tried to make people understand concepts and he did so in a very admirable way he used language that is both easy to understand and at the same time explains the unexplainable
1180316 once again do the four noble truths relate to all kinds of suffering a simple yes or no would do
1180317 personally i will not use the allegation while campaigning but i cannot guarantee others would not use it during the campaign not only umno members from penang will be here
1180318 i have offered myself for the seat but even if im not selected to be the candidate ill work hard to ensure bns victory let the leaders decide on candidates i am a party worker and i will work hard
1180319 we have ways to convince the people to vote for bn voters have realised that the pakatan rakyat is only good with promises but have yet to deliver them
1180320 i wouldnt be surprised if they come up with doctored pictures of datuk seri anwar
1180321 i believe it is going to be used as they have no other issues but we are not worried as we have more important issues to highlight
1180322 my only concern is the sluggish stock market i dont know whether i will have enough for my retirement i think some changes are necessary
1180323 i dont see how they are able to proceed with the case but my legal team suggested that we should come prepared for the worst
1180324 we have gone on the ground we have been meeting the mps including those in sabah and sarawak
1180325 we will have a more transparent economic programme procurement policies contracts which will be more attractive to foreign investors
1180326 the new economic agenda should be transparent the affirmative action programme must be based on need not on race
1180327 it should not be abused to help a few rich malays
1180328 assuming things are free and fair i shouldnt have any problems
1180329 we were very comfortable behind those averages but weve had to step from behind those average and really take account of these high risk groups
1180330 by having to be accountable to these individual groups thats a much higher bar that weve got to cross we cant just rest on the average population of kids
1180331 it takes some soul bearing we had to open the closet and get some skeletons out and really deal with that
1180332 you make this kind of goal by changing the way teachers teach when teachers take ownership for those individual kids and they truly dont leave a child behind you can make it you can do it
1180333 at that moment in time she represented all of us hitting that bump in the road the place where every time before now wed all get stuck and she had every opportunity to give up but instead she held on through anger through tears through support from her friends and her coach we all stood by and watched what i can only describe as one of the deepest connections ive ever felt with someone i didnt even know six months ago she held on and completed every step of the course and because of tracy i feel like i completed it too
1180334 well that might work for x but it will never work here
1180335 since the foundation of the us it was often europeans who cut to the chase of americas sentiments the classics range from alexis de tocquevilles studies of democracy in america to robert franks photo book the americans to wim wenders paris texas in a country which so consistently works on a homogeneous cultural identity the view point of outsiders is so focused because they discover so much in the every day life that is very basic the german photographer peter granser also has been traveling across the us for years in his two stunning photo books with his melancholic view point he reduced the colourful side of the us to sun bleached ruins of the american dream with his new book he now presents an essay about the conservative america which in its minimalistic directness deeply penetrates the mood of the country that is at a historic turn around point the photos were taken in texas that is in the very state which george w declares to be his home and in which strict piety and defiant combativeness combine to a unique attitude that is so alien to us europeans granser avoids becoming polemic his photos are guided by the sometimes subtle sometimes confrontational signs left by this society in the empty texan landscape they are guided by the clear view of the outsider who knows a lot but claims nothing
1180336 maybe you need to be a foreign photographer to find the essence of a country
1180337 guided by the clear view of the outsider who doesnt know anything but claims a lot
1180338 this image symbolically stands for the whole misery of the iraq war and the bush government
1180339 peter please im an x man i dont shoot people im just trying to make a point
1180340 if people are not receiving salaries of a realistic level it is impossible to ask them to work properly
1180341 i told them if after this you act corruptly i will not apologise for punishing you with the harshest of punishments
1180342 was i expecting that after six months everybody would become clean
1180343 certainly not i have 62 000 people working for me will all the judges immediately become good no this is going to be a continuous battle which leaders must wage constantly
1180344 she has proved her technical skills in managing the macro economy

1180350 the combination of tight financial conditions high petrol prices and low confidence is weighing heavily
1180351 the weakness in the leading index components relating to employment and new orders is concerning
1180352 in response to steadily declining new orders businesses are using existing inventories of finished goods to meet current demand for services
1180353 the latest employment sub index readings show that services firms are also re evaluating their staffing requirements in light of the economic slowdown

1180363 we are surprised by what has happened these players have been asked to play for their national teams
1180364 twenty years ago we made the decision that the olympic games should be for players under 23 we have never had a complaint or put into question the automatic qualification of under 23 players
1180365 i ask the teams in germany and spain if the ruling is in their favour to let the players play because they are already here
1180366 let the players play the players are the actors without the players there is no spectacle
1180367 its not only a question of solidarity but of respect for the olympic spirit and to let such young players have the experience
1180368 i was hoping to have added to the squad by now and brought a few in to give the players a lift
1180369 its not just a new face we need its new faces
1180370 my big concern is that anybody we bring in now probably wont be ready to start the premier league season
1180371 its now getting to the stage where you are wondering how long it takes for new players to settle etc
1180372 im hoping we will have some in before the start of the season
1180373 por favor tem dois peda os de ab boras na geladeira prepare e coma ou congele

1180375 i think that sort of talk is absolutely unhelpful mr swan told abc radio
1180376 i think it is utterly irresponsible to speculate about that and i certainly wont be doing that
1180377 i certainly think australian home owners would welcome some relief but that is entirely a matter for the independent reserve bank he said
1180378 our may budget struck the right balance between fighting inflation on the one hand and investing in the future on the other he said
1180379 but we have perhaps the most difficult global conditions in over 25 years
1180380 it is very difficult to predict how the current market will play out and the full extent of its impact on the economy chief executive andrew penn said
1180381 in the meantime it will continue to be difficult for all of us in our industry
1180382 it is our job to focus on the long term because the long term trends in our industry continue to be attractive
1180383 once confidence is shaken and markets become fragile it does take a reasonable period of time for markets to recover from that mr penn said
1180384 we help clients to manage through these cycles if everything only went up then nobody would need organisations like us
1180385 the new zealand market continues to be very challenging mr penn said
1180386 hong kong clearly remains an attractive market and an important growth engine for us in the region mr penn said

1180395 the district court mistakenly limited its analysis primarily to the embodiment requirement
1180396 as a result of this error once it determined that the buffer data was clearly capable of being reproduced i e that the work was embodied in the buffer the district court concluded that the work was therefore fixed in the buffer and that a copy had thus been made
1180397 while our inquiry is necessarily fact specific and other factors not present here may alter the duration analysis significantly
1180398 these facts strongly suggest that the works in this case are embodied in the buffer for only a transitory period thus failing the duration requirement
1180399 cablevision we note also has subscribers who use home vcrs or dvrs like tivo and has significant control over the content recorded by these customers but this control is limited to the channels of programming available to a customer and not to the programs themselves cablevision has no control over what programs are made available on individual channels or when those programs will air if at all in this respect cablevision possesses far less control over recordable content than it does in the video on demand context where it actively selects and makes available beforehand the individual programs available for viewing for these reasons we are not inclined to say that cablevision rather than the user does the copying produced by the rs dvr system as a result we find that the district court erred in concluding that cablevision rather than its rs dvr customers makes the copies carried out by the rs dvr system
1180400 cablevision argues that because each rs dvr transmission is made using a single unique copy of a work made by an individual subscriber one that can be decoded exclusively by that subscribers cable box only one subscriber is capable of receiving any given rs dvr transmission
1180401 we do not believe that an rs dvr customer is sufficiently distinguishable from a vcr user to impose liability as a direct infringer on a different party for copies that are made automatically upon that customers command
1180402 cablevision has no control over what programs are made available on individual channels or when those programs will air if at all
1180403 in this respect cablevision possesses far less control over recordable content than it does in the vod context where it actively selects and makes available beforehand the individual programs available for viewing
1180404 this decision is a great victory for innovation technological progress and consumers rights
1180405 the content industry in suing cablevision once again overreached in its goal to limit the personal uses of increasingly popular technology
1180406 we hope this case will be another signal to hollywood to scale back its attacks on consumer friendly technologies
1180407 sent shock waves to every corner of the media landscape
1180408 the person who actually presses the button to make the recording supplies the necessary element of volition not the person who manufactures maintains or if distinct from the operator owns the machine
1180409 cablevision more closely resembles a store proprietor who charges customers to use a photocopier on his premises and it seems incorrect to say without more that such a proprietor makes any copies when his machines are actually operated by his customers
1180410 would not directly infringe plaintiffs exclusive rights to reproduce and publicly perform their copyrighted works
1180411 this is a tremendous victory for consumers which will allow us to make dvrs available to many more people faster and less expensively than would otherwise be possible
1180412 we appreciate the courts perspective that from the standpoint of existing copyright law remote storage dvrs are the same as the traditional dvrs that are in use today
1180413 we are going to take advantage of both centralized and distributed approaches where it makes sense
1180414 we could develop a centralized service that is similar to cablevisions but it doesnt preclude us from also leveraging hard drives in the home to do other things
1180415 it was assumed petrol prices would impact on the tourism industry but nobody expected the traditional australian family holiday to have changed so much

1180437 the bill risks conflating the roles of parliament and the judiciary which would be quite inappropriate
1180438 this is a recipe for confusion that arguably risks undermining the rights of fair trial for the individuals concerned
1180439 considering that any debate will be highly political in nature and any vote may well be whipped by the political parties we are deeply concerned that the independence of the judiciary may appear to be undermined and that trials may be prejudiced
1180440 would not directly infringe plaintiffs exclusive rights to reproduce and publicly perform their copyrighted works
1180441 there is this madness around me around my family without a doubt out on the field is where im most comfortable where im happiest because i know what im doing and i know i can do it
1180442 im a really bad loser it stays with me for a while i always take it quite personally when we dont win as a team or i dont win in everything else i do
1180443 people always ask me do you play golf because a majority of sportsmen do i used to play quite a few years ago but to be honest id rather spend four hours with the kids than four hours on a golf course as much as it can be relaxing its a frustrating sport my way of relaxing is listening to music and spending time with the kids
1180444 youll never play for england because youre too small and not strong enough

1180446 the banks are saying the nexus is broken that just because rates come down dont expect us to follow i think thats a poor argument
1180447 the first thing they do is increase rates when official rates go up
1180448 if they dont do it we will really see their spin doctors earning their money trying to explain that
1180449 many consumers will find it impossible to understand why thats the case financially or ethically
1180450 i think customers will be absolutely filthy if the banks do not pass on within a reasonable time any official cash rate reductions
1180451 in the current international economic climate and world credit conditions it is essential that our banks remain well capitalised and profitable this is in the interests of depositors borrowers shareholders and the broader australian economy
1180452 the simple fact is that banks like any other businesses have to adjust their prices when their cost base significantly increases
1180453 a lot more to do with the global credit crisis
1180454 we dont think the reserve bank will be confident enough or anxious enough about demand to drop interest rates

1180461 i know youre not much of a book reader and i know youre a good little catholic boy who believes in god and all that
1180462 a guide to compassionate living through the techniques of tibetan buddhism
1180463 give it a try you have a lot of regret about your life and this sense that you some how missed out on something this book is all about living in the moment and realizing that where you are is exactly where you are supposed to be
1180464 how did you know i was secretly a fan of tibetan buddhism
1180465 you have to promise youll read it when im gone
1180466 i asked this was typical penny springing bad news on me at the last minute
1180467 i have to go to my mothers for a while to take care of her
1180468 but it will give you time to finish the book i know what a slow reader you are
1180469 you know theres something ive been wanting to give you
1180470 i wear it every day each piece is so rare in color shape and detail
1180471 a voter will come in there will be a bar code scanner that will scan the drivers license that will automatically bring up the voters name and it will issue them a ballot
1180472 i just think the technology is wonderful its cool to be kind of on the cutting edge
1180473 they will pull up your name in the computer and they just click a button and will have your ballot number right there
1180474 i think it will speed things up it will be more efficient
1180475 is going to save a ton of time and a ton of frustration
1180476 people probably will only notice a person sitting at the table with a computer
1180477 its going to be pretty discreet for this time because were still using the old process
1180478 were doing this all by hand now its a way for us to do that with a push of a button
1180479 it should make things more efficient at the polls if one process can take the place of two
1180480 some west michigan voters entering digital age with election day pilot program
1180481 there simply isnt an environmental law that exists presently that allows us to pick and choose or say that we simply dont need this many coal plants
1180482 so weve got to deal with them one at a time and were trying to do the best we can
1180483 most legislators do appreciate the fact that there is a legitimate role for the department to play

1180489 the world is watching and they are waiting for us and they are waiting to see what were made of
1180490 thats not something that is permitted in the cba collective bargaining agreement its not something we are going to allow and something should they decide to do we will have to manage it the way we would manage any other violation of the collective bargaining agreement i believe we have got great players who have strong levels of integrity and competitive spirit and i believe they will play this game the way they play every other game we will pay the prize money as it was originially dictated as determined by mls ownership if there is something we determine is a violation of the cba we will address it
1180491 it goes to the club owner its no different from a nascar tournament where the team owner wins prize money and the team owner has a driver under contract and whatever his agreement with that driver is is what that driver receives what i have found very frustrating is that this has been positioned as the league misleading the public by saying that the prize would go to the players we never ever implied that the players would get the one million dollars the winner is the team the club gets that million dollar prize and then we have an agreement as to what that share would be to the players

1180500 to add 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 1 7 1 8 1 9 the trick is to find the lowest common denominator from 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
1180501 in practice few people add up fractions much more complicated than 1 2 hour 1 4 hour and i am not surprised that this complicated theory has left little trace on the collective mind probably the misuse of the metaphor of lowest common denominator has arisen by people confusing it with the
1180502 the folks over at missing link are offering their buddies and clients a free tattoo this threw me into a panic and i quickly pulled out one of my favorite of roger von oechs whack pack cards solve the right problem i love this image i copied von oechs question mark into artrage and started messing around with it the red pink background is meant to represent skin tone
1180503 this didnt hurt much at all it was more of a sort of vibrating vague sting that numbed out after about ten minutes when the colors settle this will be a very painterly piece of skin its not discernible now but everything is blended and shaded and graded ill post a pic in a week or so when its looking more like it ought to
1180504 oh hes great thanks hes actually moving out to san diego this week
1180505 i was careful with my reference not to use a right wing source for the argument unless becker posner is a right wing source
1180506 i cant remember missing any practices in the seven years ive been here in camp and even during the season so it was a lot different for me to be over here and just working out and not being with the guys on the field i was happy to get back out for sure
1180507 ill let my people and them handle that so im just working on getting back on the field
1180508 they are all intelligent guys and they are all guys that can do different things
1180509 we have the ability to run two and three tight ends
1180510 its a really good group of guys weve got guys that can bring different things to the offense i think its going to be a lot of fun
1180511 im fortunate that this is my third year into the offense and weve added a few wrinkles but ive been through that process the last two years so i feel real good with the offense
1180512 were excited just trying to expand some of the things i can do for the team
1180513 ill look at it marinate on it and you know make a decision
1180514 but it wont be any sort of earth shattering news

1180517 the timing of the united states ratification on the eve of the beijing olympic games is appropriate
1180518 the convention makes clear that the use of performance enhancing drugs to gain a competitive advantage undercuts the positive attributes of sport
1180519 they want independence and they know with money they can be independent
1180520 if we can change the mindset of this younger generation we can change the world
1180521 having your money work for you rather than working for your money
1180522 its good to always keep your money in order because everything else is in order
1180523 now instead of buying whatever kind of sneakers i would think about it twice and put the money in the bank
1180524 if they were a retail outlet and they didnt encrypt their credit card details they wouldnt be allowed to continue providing a credit card service it really is that basic

1180533 senior citizen gamers win hands down if we convert the ps2 owners to ps3
1180534 when we look at the total available market we salivate at the notion of converting our existing ps2 universe
1180535 i think the reality is that we will win hands down if we convert the ps2 owners to ps3
1180536 when we look at the total available market we salivate at the notion of converting our existing ps2 universe
1180537 every million units we drop into the ps2 is an annuity thats going to pay out later on for ps3 upgrades and weve got some interesting ideas on how to reach out to those ps2 owners in the us and convert them up
1180538 i think the notion of that controller is a non trivial point that youve brought up that control and that familiarity is like comfort food from my perspective we lead we dont follow
1180539 and as a brand nintendos got their thing and were not trying to get the senior citizen group to get into gaming were looking to convert the ps2 owners and the tens of millions of installed base that were playing dvds and playing games on their ps2 to now play blu ray movies and blu ray games with their ps3
1180540 we would look at technology that helped enable that as oppose to trying to iterate or be derivative off of somebody elses vision
1180541 ten years it goes back to our mantra of ten years technology thats associated with the playstation has to have future proof qualities to it
1180542 i think that were seeing graphically ps3 games starting to create some distance and some of the other competitors are going to feel that theyre getting long in the tooth looking quite dated because they havent created that ten year vision from a horsepower standpoint
1180543 these can save someones life so its not a laughing matter
1180544 the decision is a matter for the european court we shall seek to have his case expedited so it is heard as soon as possible
1180545 he always demanded that female workers signalled to him with their eyes that they desperately wanted to be laid on the boardroom table as soon as he gave the word

1180549 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1180550 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1180551 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1180552 he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact he raised more than one million dollars from big oil just last month
1180553 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1180554 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires
1180555 the final guide we have this year is to think of them in an e10 context that doesnt mean it wont change but this fall they wont be able to blow each others heads off
1180556 we think its really important that these things can scale between in game and out of game and how we can use them on the web
1180557 well make sure we have a clearly defined plan in relation to snags because its valuable standing and not as valuable when knocked down by a chainsaw
1180558 its the best and worst as far as it goes
1180559 the actual return for growers is the best time and for the buyers the supply of hops its the worst its a double edged sword
1180560 things in the hops business have never really been like this before never seen anything like this suddenly they find themselves on top of the world
1180561 a lot of orders going out a lot of getting ready for receiving

1180565 some of the most important assistance gleaned by the students from the dispensary is aside from knowledge of medicine and surgery which they gain there they learn through contact with people who are aided by the organization that medical aid can be benefited by a knowledge of home conditions of the patient and by friendly aid they are taught that cures are often more easily effected by elimination of aggravating surroundings and mental conditions than by the administration of drugs
1180566 portland free dispensary is building on the principle that a healthful city is a hopeful and a happy city and that the right of every man is health
1180567 the record of history is that upon the initiative of private philanthropy depends the recognition of public duty almost every function now recognized by the state or the city in the interest of social advancement was begun by private initiative legislatures and municipalities have little time for originating and testing new programs and it is here that philanthropy has rendered its most patriotic service by accepting as its mission the awakening and the stimulating of the conscience of the state and the nation
1180568 we are not interested in an amicable settlement it is not just a question of money but more importantly in principle
1180569 we are forced to watch every week if key software pirates are not on the internet we are a small company of six employees instead of trying to protect us we could spend this time to develop ourselves
1180570 with games like ours you get much more controversy when you add motion controls like you saw with manhunt 2
1180571 we have weapons like chainsaws satchel charges stuff like that i can definitely see people having a problem and outcry towards that because it does actually feel like youre using weapons that way
1180572 id say that the nintendo e3 press conference was definitely underwhelming
1180573 at volition were really about pushing really good graphics and with the wii you just fell like youre playing on an older console
1180574 were definitely focused on the xbox 360 and ps3 ps3 trophies
1180575 were making the ps3 version first and then porting to the 360 later
1180576 if ive learned three things from this generation is that rrod blows the wii is a gimmicky childs toy and sony is good at being late
1180577 mr oberst im afraid well need to do a root canal
1180578 saw an eagle on a pole i think it was an eagle
1180579 if i go to heaven ill be bored as hell
1180580 we have to make a serious nationwide commitment to developing new sources of energy and we have to do it right away
1180581 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to meet the challenges we face or isnt giving the american people straight talk

1180597 the bull smelt my dad who had just been with cows and thought he was a cow ready for mating
1180598 but when my dad pushed him off the bull went mad began to charge and toss him around the field tearing his clothes and hurling him to the ground
1180599 the cows have to be happy if theyre not they wont give milk
1180600 our cows used to lie on concrete but now they have mattresses made of soft rubber with a covering of sawdust which they prefer
1180601 water beds are available but these can be very expensive
1180602 if a person is unwell their breath can smell so i personally think you can taste the difference in the milk of a happy cow it tastes sweeter
1180603 were hoping this puts everything poo related behind us so that we can focus on the real issue which is the fact that the democrats are part of a crappy system oppresses and coerces communities into a capitalist economy and undemocratic government

1180614 master to whom would we go you have the words of real life eternal life weve already committed ourselves confident that you are the holy one of god
1180615 you have the words of real life eternal life were committed to you
1180616 i stood on the podium with the crowd cheering and a medal all i could think of was is this what i trained for all my life
1180617 okay i dont understand everything about this but i see these facts im going to act on this knowledge and take jesus at his word
1180618 if anyone chooses to do gods will he will find out whether my teaching comes from god or whether i speak on my own

1180625 i think the entire council is committed now we all understand we need to have the question on the ballot we need to have the voters have the opportunity to vote and voice their opinion
1180626 broken down per capita when you calculate inflation its anywhere from 4 6 thousand dollars per head just to build rail transit
1180627 you cant just take the total amount of the project and divide it by the number of people and say thats how much everyone is going to pay thats just an inaccuracy

1180637 the characters of the people who vie for the presidency are more significant than their political philosophies

1180639 if only i get that job that wife that car that bit of entertainment that lover that whatever
1180640 researchers will not attempt to solve the question of whether god exists but whether belief in god conferred an evolutionary advantage to mankind they will also consider the possibility that faith developed as a byproduct of other human characteristics such as sociability
1180641 no eye has seen no ear has heard and no mind has imagined what god has prepared for those who love him
1180642 if there were video cameras at the time could we have filmed the resurrection
1180643 being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see
1180644 in the months ahead it will be important to invite those absent from lambeth to be involved in these next stages
1180645 much in the gafcon documents is consonant with much of what we have sought to say and do and we need to look for the best ways of building bridges here
1180646 our absence focused minds on the problems within the communion and spoke louder than our presence would have
1180647 the primates council of gafcon will wish to study the outcome of the lambeth conference carefully and consult with those they are leading they are meeting towards the end of august and will make their response following that meeting
1180648 a spirit of mutual submission to prevail and for unity to be restored
1180649 most valuable opportunity to express our thoughts and concerns and to listen to the concerns of others
1180650 pertain to central moral teaching while the last is a matter simply of administration and good order
1180651 stand in solidarity with all the faithful bishops clergy and laity in the united states and canada and elsewhere who are suffering recrimination and hostility perpetrated upon them by their dioceses and or national churches which have not unequivocally complied with the specific windsor proposals required of them in full
1180652 engage theologically and practically with situations of controversy as they arise or divisive actions that may be taken around the communion
1180653 look within the next two months for a clear and detailed specification for the task and composition of a pastoral forum
1180654 substantial theological voices outside of the western world have not been present in the evening plenary sessions of the lambeth conference
1180655 continuing patronising attitude of the west towards the rest of the churches worldwide
1180656 attempts to cause divisions and break the bonds between churches in the global south
1180657 the realities in our churches are often misrepresented and misunderstood in the west
1180658 how to move the global anglican communion substantially and effectively forward
1180659 all orthodox groups in the united states of america and canada to listen together to what lord jesus says to his church today to draw strength and insights from one another and to take fresh initiatives in upholding and passing on the faith once delivered to the saints
1180660 there will be some who cannot abide by these moratoria and in this they signal that there are steps to deeper unity they cannot take or it may be that they conceive of deeper unity in other ways
1180661 as incumbent on me and on us in the diocese to actively labor to both understand the position of those to whom that moratorium is important and to convey the reality of our life together to the world
1180662 we will pay close attention to it but we must not reify the agreement points in it into laws and we should resist interpretations that seek to employ those agreements as laws
1180663 resist the temptation of those who will try to turn this descriptive document into a proscriptive edict
1180664 to break the cycle of being bullied into bigotry and distracted from mission and ministry by those who would exclude us because of our commitment to the full inclusion of all the baptized in the body of christ
1180665 we look forward to general convention 2009 and the opportunities we will have there to move the church further forward on the journey toward full inclusion
1180666 we remind our bishops that we cannot live up to our baptismal vows to respect the dignity of every human being if we tell some of them that they are good enough to arrange our flowers play our organs direct our choirs teach our sunday schools and lead our worship but not good enough to have their vocations affirmed and their relationships blessed
1180667 there is nothing generous about asking the lgbt faithful to bear the burden of unity of the anglican communion on their shoulders and there is no theological defense for sacrificing a minority of the baptized to the will of a majority
1180668 face to face with fellow believers who hold a view of scripture that i cannot understand
1180669 to the level of saving the faith or should be the cause of the breaking of communion
1180670 hold together as much as i can for as long as i can that when he comes to his rightful place on st augustines throne in canterbury cathedral he will have a faithful and richly textured kingdom

1181268 but if there is no resurrection of the dead not even christ has been raised and if christ has not been raised then our preaching is in vain and so is your faith
1181269 no reliable or lasting portrait of jesus has ever been reconstructed from going behind what the four gospels portray

1181281 the auction houses and buyers often cant tell the difference
1181282 a large number of fakes are finding their way into auctions everywhere
1181283 in france one of the areas where this has really hit the business theres a laundering of these fake ceramics because traditionally france has always had a large number of private collections and in the old days that was where all the great finds and discoveries were made
1181284 it has spoilt the whole industry because people have no confidence
1181285 certainly the rapid rise in prices and the wider participation of new buyers in the market have given greater incentive to fakers to do the best they can
1181286 the exquisite matter thats made to fool professionals these we dont see that often on the market
1181287 i think the game has been the same for the past few decades but the knowledge needs to be updated its always been a challenge and well have to continue to keep those fakes from jingdezhen in check itll continue to be an area where we have to be increasingly vigilant
1181288 if you buy without knowledge privately and are tempted by a low price then the risk will be larger
1181289 there are pieces that are publicized in the newspapers having set record prices where an experienced collector or dealer takes one look and says not a chance that its old its just part of a game thats going on

1181317 as a writer its harder to find an acceptable balance as i said i refuse to lie and the sad fact is betrayal and violence thats life thats a fallen humanity so yah my characters will do awful things and you may find a bad word here or there and some implied sexual activity but as far as gratuitousness or leaving the bedroom door open i wont do that because i dont have the stomach for it also because i know the effect that books can have over people i refuse to be gratuitous i wont shy away from it if the story demands it later in my novel it takes place fifteen years after the prologue so the main characters are around 18 you discover that rigel is sleeping with his sons betrothed and there is a nasty scene where she says shes tired of the arrangement and the scene ends with rigel saying she already made the choice was it ridiculously hard for me to write yes does that make it any less necessary no the reason hes the antagonist is that hes capable of stuff like that well its actually because hes at odds with the protagonist but it helps that hes kinda evil g god gave me a working conscience i wrote a story with a significantly steamy tone and plot and i got 10k into it and threw it away because i couldnt justify writing it i want to be published someday and while i can explain to you why i read write what i do i cant put a disclaimer in the front for any readers of mine who are christian or know i am its one thing to admit the world is the way it is and show that and another to do it in a way that i can sleep at night which is really the crux of the matter for me

1181349 temptations to sin are sure to come but woe to the one through whom they come it would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were cast into the sea than that he should cause one of these little ones to sin pay attention to yourselves if your brother sins rebuke him and if he repents forgive him and if he sins against you seven times in the day and turns to you seven times saying i repent you must forgive him

1181403 not only these two points but for sure reliability because we cannot accept to have these kind of problems even if it was only 10 kilometers from the end we cannot have this problem of reliability because we are paying too much of a price for it
1181404 its a big one its someones livelihood i think hes had enough chances and to go down this track it just takes it over the edge so i would think maybe yes
1181405 i think just the protectionism that eddies trying to give his club to save the image in fact is detrimental to the very thing youre trying to build and thats the culture
1181406 he mcguire loves the club hes got passion for the club but this has been behind the scenes and theyve always said they can handle it

1181419 right now personally i would have to give the edge to two sort in terms of the quality of the actual recycled materials
1181420 but people still have disagreements and they feel very strongly one way or the other
1181421 the easier you make it the more people will do it
1181422 i totally think that when im considering whether to walk that tin can to the street this would give me that little more incentive

1181482 they raise the cattle in saskatchewan they come here to feed and finish and they get butchered in our plants here in alberta
1181483 alberta has the bulk of the kill capacity so we consider that to be alberta beef

1181485 its been a challenging number of years first the drought then the bse when we were shut out of a number of export markets and so on

1181579 think of it as a key to unlock the next era of computing the many core era
1181580 its a bit like a supercomputer on a chip really the sky is the limit in terms of what software makers can do with it
1181581 it is important for industry to work in tandem with academia to unleash the immense power of parallel computing

1181592 ive seen bicycles cruise right through that intersection from one sidewalk to another right in front of a car and if not for a driver paying attention that can be a very serious accident

1181608 our strategy of having a low cost processor opens new markets for us
1181609 we werent leveraging our strength in bringing powerful performing processors into the market
1181610 the key for us is we have to be able to hit the right power and cost characteristics
1181611 this analysis likely understates the true regressive nature of both the bush and mccain tax cuts because it does not include the cost to families of the budget cuts that will ultimately be needed to pay for the tax cuts
1181612 heavy funding cuts for after school programs student aid public broadcasting and job training

1181623 the greatest destabilizing factor has been the proportional representational system inflicted upon us by our zionist founding fathers
1181624 this inherent weakness of the system was concealed during the early years of the state because the leaders then would never contemplate promoting their personal agendas above the welfare of the nation
1181625 the only solution to the jewish question is the establishment of a jewish state
1181626 it is to wage war by sea land and air with all our might and with all the strength that god can give us to wage war against a monstrous tyranny never surpassed in the dark lamentable catalogue of human crime that is our policy
1181627 it is obviously something bigger the name of the game is to decapitate the iranian nuclear program whether it is aimed at a weapon or not
1181628 the use of these weapons causes acute pain constituting a form of torture the uns committee against torture said
1181629 in certain cases they can even cause death as has been shown by reliable studies and recent real life events the committee of 10 experts said
1181630 should consider giving up the use of the taser x26 as its use can have a grave physical and mental impact on those targeted which violates the uns convention against torture the experts said
1181631 perhaps it is time that the usa should consider giving up the use of the taser as well
1181632 its a provocative finding because the kinds of difficulties that were observed are the same kinds of changes we see in people who have suffered electrical shocks from accidents involving domestic power sources

1181637 this years annual list of top searches from aol offers an interesting take on what people found interesting in news politics entertainment and pop culture in 2007
1181638 there are some things that have to be seen to be believed
1181639 the explosion of video on the web combined with the ability to search for almost anything has given us a unique ability to view the public moments and performances that became some of the most popular talked about or engaging topics throughout the year
1181640 unlike its previous mobile search offering aol folks have worked out an interface that requires minimal triple tap typing using keywords and tabs it is easier for mobile surfers to find some of aol services such as maps movie information and local information
1181641 aol does a magnificent job of integrating its own content into the mobile search experience and given its suite of ready for mobile services like moviefone mapquest and cityguide
1181642 aol has improved its mobile search capability especially for windows mobile devices there are now two types of search experiences a windows mobile experience and a regular presentation of the content which is also improved but with a different presentation
1181643 make way aols getting into mobile search and unlike many of the companys older products the logically named aol mobile search service has been getting some positive initial reviews
1181644 if you need to search on the go aol mobile search seems to make is easy enough
1181645 most apps in the iphone app store are 10 or less with the bulk at under 5 if thats where the market settles out developers who planned on making a living selling iphone software may be in for market whiplash

1181654 extremely critical of israels policies in the territories and its attitude toward the palestinian authoritys pa security services
1181655 arousing considerable discomfort its conclusions about israel are scathing and those whove seen it say it make s israel look very bad
1181656 one of the greatest human rights crimes on earth and to see europeans going along with this is embarrassing
1181657 the top opinion pollster in ramallah said that opinion on the west bank is shifting to hamas because people believe fatah sold out to israel and the us
1181658 i think the sea probably is polluted sometimes i get strange white marks on my skin but we come down to the beach each day because we have nowhere else to go
1181659 sewage pipe pours mucky water into streams of dark waste that flow towards the sea
1181660 the sea is getting dirtier and more contaminated because of chronic fuel and spare parts shortages we need 14 days of uninterrupted power in order to run a proper sewage treatment cycle for the sake of gazas public health
1181661 waterborne outbreaks are to be avoided because of their capacity to result in the simultaneous infection of a high proportion of the community
1181662 restrictions are a clear violation of the universal right to health and a clean environment under international humanitarian law israel as an occupying power is obligated to facilitate access to all essential to life amenities access to clean drinking and sea water are basic human rights
1181663 the idf will probably stop us but part of the point is to show that gaza is closed off

1181666 we are living in fear of the devastation of our society
1181667 the blockade makes export impossible so farmers are abandoning their crops israeli incursions result in huge destruction to lands and enterprises almost every industry in gaza is facing ruin this collective punishment must end
1181668 gaza alone without the west bank cannot survive it needs free borders and access 1
1181669 how can gaza be a normal place how can we live a normal life here
1181670 will i avoid the gulfstream or warren the yacht because of the surcharge
1181671 consider as an example a single household age 30 earning 50 000 the household s average tax rate under the current system is 21 1 percent it s 13 5 percent under the fairtax since the fairtax would preserve the purchasing power of social security benefits and also provide a tax rebate older low income workers who will live primarily or exclusively on social security would be better off as an example the average remaining lifetime tax rate for an age 60 married couple with 20 000 of earnings falls from its current value of 7 2 percent to 11 0 percent under the fairtax as another example compare the current 24 0 percent remaining lifetime average tax rate of a married age 45 couple with 100 000 in earnings to the 14 7 percent rate that arises under the fairtax
1181672 once one moves to generations postdating the baby boomers there are positive welfare gains for all income groups in each cohort under a 23 percent fairtax policy the poorest members of the generation born in 1990 enjoy a 13 5 percent welfare gain their middle class and rich contemporaries experience 5 and 2 percent welfare gains respectively the welfare gains are largest for future generations take the cohort born in 2030 the poorest members of this cohort enjoy a huge 26 percent improvement in their well being for middle class members of this birth group theres a 12 percent welfare gain and for the richest members of the group the gain is 5 percent
1181673 either scrap the code and enact the fairtax or we intend on replacing you with someone who will
1181674 tax rebates have been a very effective way of propping up the economy in the second quarter and less so in the third quarter
1181675 to fix the economic growth problems you have to restore liquidity to the system

1181687 telstra is taking advantage of a narrow window of opportunity before new laws come into existence under which an independent umpire can order employers to negotiate in good faith with worker representatives
1181688 this is the same strategy telstra pursued earlier this year when it knew awas were about to be banned and using morally dubious tactics made a final push to sign 15 000 workers on to individual contracts

1181699 sastanak je bio zanimljiv drago mi je da smo sve uspjeli dogovoriti grupa je vrlo zahtjevna a probleme u dogovoru stvarala nam je injenica da bjelorusija i ukrajina u o ujku ne mogu igrati ku i zbog snijega

1181701 i made my purchases for diving water polo and boxing back on june 14 and it all seemed reasonable
1181702 i paid 550 for a ticket to the diving preliminaries and found out later the official website had them priced at 44 i was happy to pay a premium because the tickets were so highly sought after
1181703 i sent my credit card number on final payment and received a receipt with dates they charged me 40 extra to send the tickets by registered post
1181704 generally speaking in privacy their reputation is not great most recently there was a major dispute over the lack of a privacy statement on googles main portal the link is there now but its as small as they could possibly get away with
1181705 google has consulted with us and that has been very positive but arguably the consultation could have gone wider
1181706 neki su jednostavno prebrzi da bi ih se moglo zaustaviti
1181707 sve nas je pogodila eduardova te ka ozljeda tako i mene stra no je ovo to se sad pri a da je moglo do i do dugotrajnih posljedica i to ne samo to se ti e nogometa
1181708 iznenadio me tako vrst start ve u tre oj minuti utakmice ali ne vjerujem da je taylor namjerno i ao na nogu eduarda njegova je ozljeda podigla puno pra ine slike nesre e su obi le svijet ali takve se stvari uistinu rijetko doga aju
1181709 tako bi moglo ispasti i da je sve to planirano ima igra a koji su malo grublji ali stvarno ne vjerujem da je taylor to u inio namjerno ili po trenerevom nare enju takve stvari se u nogometu jednostavno doga aju
1181710 neki igra i su prebrzi da bi ih se zaustavilo te se mogu dogoditi dva tri prekr aja za redom ali o i sudaca uvijek su uprte ba u te najbolje tako da se prekr aji na njima mo da malo i preuveli avaju
1181711 isto se dogodilo i 1998 kad se ozlijedio bok i koji je onda bio u najboljoj formi ali ta je reprezentacija svejedno napravila veliki rezultat ova reprezentacija je jaka ne ovisi samo o eduardu i idemo dalje
1181712 nizozemci su nam zabili tri gola ali ne treba nakon jedne utakmice kriviti obranu prije par mjeseci mogli smo isto tako govoriti da je obrana najbolji dio ekipe prije eura ima jo dovoljno utakmica za pripremu tijekom kojih e se sve iskristalizirati sad ho e li se u reprezentaciji otvoriti mjesta za mene ili nekog drugog o tome ne elim razmi ljati

1181762 if alli is blocking fat absorption where is the fat going
1181763 we are disappointed that massachusetts filed this action because it ignores the only reason our advisers sold auction rate securities they believed they were good investments for clients willing to trade some liquidity for higher return
1181764 the inarguable fact is the number of auctions that had failed in nearly two decades of auction rate securities sales was small in 2007 there were no failed auctions of securities sold to retail clients and in fact none to these clients until late january 2008
1181765 that auction markets were not functioning properly and were in fact in significant danger of collapsing
1181766 our research reflected the honest belief that ars offered higher returns in exchange for less liquidity and noted that market changes had begun to occur
1181767 our principal concern is to make people whole particularly individuals and small businesses who have been completely upended by this
1181768 we want merrill lynch to undo the damage they did by selling these things knowingly to people telling them they had liquidity then leaving them stranded when they knew these auction markets were in trouble
1181769 i bought an old computer keyboard from value village sprinkled it with alfalfa seeds and sprouted them that took a good week by april 1 there were nice thick green sprouts coming up between the keys i pushed my bosss regular keyboard to the back of the keyboard drawer and put this keyboard in its place he sort of laughed but started picking the spouts out and dumping them in the trash i couldnt believe hed think id do that to his actual keyboard though that made it funnier
1181770 constant home do over fetish in real life and in the reality of reality tv
1181771 you could and will say the harpers had it coming but really we all had this coming
1181772 one thing well always remember about this decade was the constant home do over fetish in real life and in the reality of reality tv the constant warping of the consumers sense of entitlement the fairy dust economics the mastercard reminder that the experience is priceless
1181773 its aggravating it just makes you mad you do that much work and they just squander it
1181774 i am a 61 year old rn who was raised by my parents who had been young adults in the great depression
1181775 they continued to save money relentlessly even with my fathers income as an anesthesiologist now when i discuss the economy with my like aged friends we are so grateful for all the frugal living experiences we have had
1181776 while others may lament phil gramms comments i much like you believe we are reacting to the word and not the message clearly we are a blessed nation and people as i look at our own lifestyle i realize not only how much we have but how much beyond what we need we have
1181777 i put myself through college mainly by working part time full time in summer a very small amount from my parents and some very small scholarships when i got out of school i loved to spend every last dime because i never had the ability to do so prior to that i built up a little debt not bad but enough that it was stressful to me then i finally realized that the thing to do is live beneath your means your version of the mental recession people criticize or tease me for driving my 1994 rusty eagle talon but hey its paid for
1181778 to me owning a home is primarily something you do to house your family and secondarily to gain a sense of security from owning your own piece of real estate that you can modify as you wish i believe that owning a home has absolutely nothing to do with investing
1181779 we have worked hard to find a place we could afford then slowly pay off the loans
1181780 when we first looked the bank tried to get us to buy something they said we could afford but we wanted to feel comfortable with the payment so we continued to look for 2 years until we found something somewhat lower but still great
1181781 using tax dollars to shore up failing businesses like fannie mae and freddie mac and to help big banks weather their self inflicted crises is just wrong its an unfair burden on those who played by the rules were about to own our home and were being asked to help out people who bought bigger and fancier houses beyond their means and got into financial trouble
1181782 buying a home was the scariest thing i ever did on closing day i resisted a powerful impulse to forfeit my sizeable deposit and simply walk away i was 32 and single and i imagined disaster if i ever failed to make a mortgage payment id avoided debt until that time and it pained me to owe that kind of money for 30 years
1181783 the value of my house means security to me its mine and is worth an amount i never thought id be able to call my own my home is my refuge and the context for my life its where i am grateful to live my days

1181786 we are faced with the ugly truth that the basel convention has been unable to accomplish even the prerequisite steps of addressing the inequities and exploitation made possible by globalization
1181787 you give the most to the solutions that do the most good
1181788 theres definitely a case of hype and one sidedness on the climate debate
1181789 theres a growing sense that what we saw out of merrill lynch is the beginning of the end for the financial cleanup
1181790 growth seems likely to slow in the second half of the year so it makes sense to wait and see how things are going before raising rates
1181791 at the same time if those inflation numbers begin to get worse they recognize they may have to move sooner rather than later
1181792 we cannot and will not allow a wage price spiral to develop
1181793 if fed credibility looks a bit shaky with a weak dollar and high inflation expectations a one off rate hike could be a way to shore up your credentials
1181794 over the course of the last couple of weeks the situation has gotten shakier on the growth front but we still think its a feasible option
1181795 people have been braced for mixed results and thats what were getting costs are catching up and the consumer environment is weaker
1181796 the macroeconomists have much lower numbers for expected aggregate profitability than individual analysts and i think this is going to be the first year where the strategists are more right than the underlying analysts
1181797 we still expect the ecb to hike in september as inflation is too high and that is their primary concern but its a close call as activity is very weak now

1181806 in a word the word father is an epitome of the whole gospel
1181807 the one thing we dont want is for kevin to change he averages 50 plus in test and one day cricket and he is an unbelievable talent
1181808 everyone will ask will his batting be affected but knowing kevin he will probably average 70 as captain
1181809 you know what he is like as soon as he is put under the pump and people start saying things about him he comes back and gets a big score i would imagine he will do that this time
1181810 the first innings against south africa in the first test at lords earlier this summer was the one for me a lot was said going into that series and the finger has been pointed at him by a lot of people
1181811 he is a bit nervous at first but gets his head down and blazes a hundred that is a measure of the man when you see things like that i am sure he will take to captaincy in the same way he will take it in his stride
1181812 it is a tough job it is not just about being on the field moving the field about and changing the bowlers around
1181813 the thing is trying to leave it on the cricket field there is a lot off the field as well and i took it home with me from time to time that is what i found a bit hard about the job
1181814 michael said it affected him at home and he took the work home and i did that as well it is hard not to it is a hard job but it can be very rewarding as well if you get the results
1181815 you also need help from the rest of the side you also need a few people to lean on when i was doing the captaincy i took too much on myself and didnt have too many sounding boards or people to speak to about the job
1181816 the founders fund and accel partners the vc firms that provide the money for fbfund will have the right to fund these companies first if more funding is desired but beyond this no equity or debt will be associated with any grant made

1181820 we look forward to put in place new authorities to improve confidence and stability in markets and to provide better oversight for fannie mae and freddie mac
1181821 the oddity of the situation is if the debt is backed by the government then it might be impossible to imagine how the companies might ever fail
1181822 people were saying the turning point of the season was in toronto when
1181823 fon free internet but only if you havent customized it if you made any changes we would not overwrite them
1181824 diseases once common in the united states such as polio and whooping cough have now nearly been eliminated by vaccines
1181825 children under the age of five do not have well developed immune systems making them susceptible to a variety of diseases
1181826 immunizing our children not only protects them but it also prevents the spread of diseases to those too young or too ill to receive vaccinations prevention is the key to public health
1181827 one mark of a great book is that it makes you see things in a new way and mr friedman certainly succeeds in that goal
1181828 for apple it matters most that they patch the client libraries since there are so few osx recursive servers in use
1181829 the bottom line is that despite this update it appears that the client libraries still arent patched
1181830 the hallucinations are a side effect of this drug thats been leaked onto the streets
1181831 a lot of the conspiracy comes from that max finds out that its a drug tested by the military to create super soldiers but someone has flooded the streets with it it makes crack look like chocolate he has to take it to keep up with the fight but yeah theres a definite theme of max fighting the devils inside
1181832 it just means that the videogame fans and the adults can all go see it
1181833 sealed the idea that videogames could be more than jaunty interactive cartoons
1181834 max payne sealed the idea that videogames could be more than jaunty interactive cartoons
1181835 chris is my right hand man and they have a big fight in my office its really frenzied it feels like theyre working out a lot of frustration itll go down as one of the all time great fight scenes
1181836 before grand theft auto before manhunt max payne sealed the idea that videogames could be more than jaunty interactive cartoons
1181837 is the first video game to be turned into a movie that is truly a mature game with a cinema quality story
1181838 but john moore excited everyone by having a much bigger ambition he added emotion to the action

1181841 however great a mans natural talent may be the act of writing cannot be learned all at once
1181842 you have to write a million words before you find your voice as a writer
1181843 you cant wait for inspiration you have to go after it with a club
1181844 having imagination it takes you an hour to write a paragraph that if you were unimaginative would take you only a minute or you might not write the paragraph at all
1181845 sent financials to what looks like a capitulation low on july 15
1181846 is it obvious financials should be bought now having reached the most oversold levels since the 1987 crash and the lowest valuations since the last great buying opportunity in 1990 and 1991 or is it obvious they should be avoided since the credit problems are in the papers every day and write offs and provisioning will likely continue into 2009
1181847 when i ask what is obvious now there is little consensus
1181848 investors have to bear in mind that we saw points like this in the last couple of years in this fund but he didnt have enough of those months to make up for earlier losses
1181849 it is obvious stock prices will be higher in the future than they are now
1181850 top line growth was good but they had some trouble with lower underwriting profitability
1181851 that is their business so that is where investors may be more concerned
1181852 in addition to continuing the existing order against naked short selling the commission will continue exploring other remedies for the broader marketplace to further protect investors from distort and short artists
1181853 the next projects return profile is where we spend our time
1181854 i wouldnt say it was set in stone where my brother was going to go but he had a much better idea than i do i just have to wait and see im trying not to think about it im trying not to have any expectations
1181855 a vida aquilo que acontece enquanto fazemos planos para o futuro
1181856 people walk in and out of your life but only friends leave footprints

1181859 that it will never come again is what makes life so sweet
1181860 at 17 years old your vision of a priest is a stuffy conservative type guy
1181861 he was young he was hip he drove a camaro
1181862 hed basically presented himself as the answer to what i was looking for
1181863 i was able to talk to him about things i couldnt talk to my mother about
1181864 its lookin like im the only one in orange now you will be real quick
1181865 im bitter man and you cant make eye contact with anyone man
1181866 i got a letter from gary underwood that stated graphically how im attracted to you im not afraid to have a quote unquote erection around you i need you i want you and he spelled my name in four different languages
1181867 is supposed to be a reflection of what he was thinking about
1181868 i have four boys and i would never dream of putting them in a situation like this
1181869 its like a prisoner of war type thing you put it in a place and you hope that door never opens
1181870 they say time goes on and it will be all right but thats not the case it continues to affect me and every facet of my life
1181871 i have six children and very few any contact with i became a drug and alcohol abuser its very difficult for me to hold down jobs because i cant seem to get past it
1181872 the counselors told me without a doubt this is a result of what was happening to me and what gary underwood did to me
1181873 i do the best that i can but at the same time theres always something in the back of my head that i always have to be numbed somehow so i can forget and if i dont im even worse
1181874 i didnt turn out to be a doctor or whatever
1181875 hoy estamos abasteciendo con producci n propia y estamos con s lo dos barcos mensuales m s lo que las compa as est n trayendo as que hay total normalidad en el abastecimiento y vamos a poder enfrentar con mucha holgura este semestre
1181876 morgan has a broken arm elbow and has minor shoulder damage but was in good spirits when i spoke with him a short time ago at the elvis presley memorial trauma center at the med a level 1 trauma center at the regional medical center at memphis
1181877 he is having a little bit of surgery this afternoon or tomorrow to help correct the damage he says hell be ok and is looking forward to a full recovery
1181878 i think its safe to say no charges are planned
1181879 being a new daddy with a 3 month old little angel emi sofia at home
1181880 im hopeful the council can do enough that our project can move forward
1181881 right now were looking at may our key date is we want to be open in 2011 so we are fully prepared for the centennial celebration in 2012
1181882 we seriously have a plan emerging that has elements of ancient architecture that is growing from the materials and forms that rise out of the sonora desert
1181883 we predict their risk and then check that prediction with the real cases and see how accurately we predict that somebody might develop cancer down the road
1181884 bone density is a marker not the cause of breast cancer
1181885 dont be afraid to continue to take medication for osteoporosis
1181886 i need to stop cut back times are tough and i cant keep spending money on stupid stuff
1181887 how did i get to this point where everything that happens in my life suddenly turns into a blog post
1181888 we feel comfortable that we have the evidence we need
1181889 the transaction of business with foreign nations is executive altogether
1181890 jefferson on principle refused to acknowledge the courts right to force the executive to produce information
1181891 constantly trudging from north to south amp east to west
1181892 unauthorized by the constitution without the sanction of congress to go beyond the line of defence
1181893 an indemnity from the people through their representatives in congress
1181894 contrary to popular belief jefferson believed in an independent presidency with inherent powers
1181895 madisons low performance is attributable in part to his narrow view of his constitutional powers as president
1181896 we do think the cdo sale is large and diversified enough to be applicable to others with similar exposure and that the monoline settlements will pave the way for similar enough transactions
1181897 citi should still be able to absorb much of these charges and credit costs in general given an estimated 20 billion of second half 2008 pre provision pre tax earnings and the sale of its german retail business but the decision about raising new capital could be closer than we previously thought
1181898 the read across of the new clearing price on abs cdo 22 cents on the dollar is causing stress tests everywhere of the us names we cover this has the largest impact on citigroup
1181899 the biggest read across to other firms will be citigroup which has been far less aggressive in their marks on cdos in our view
1181900 though citi defends their marks due to their earlier vintages and high concentration of commercial paper we continue to believe they would struggle to obtain their prices in the marketplace today
1181901 given the sale of merrills 30 6 billion abs cdo portfolio we expect peers will adjust marks eliminating an incentive to hold on to impaired assets
1181902 we see this a part of the cleansing process and expect increased liquidity in the cdo market and mortgage markets
1181903 what is happening to merrill and others is death by a thousand cuts its painful to see it happen over and over again
1181904 are things that much worse than we were led to believe
1181905 if people were going to believe thain when he said merrill raised more capital than it needed to and had taken conservative marks on its securities book im not sure theyre going to believe him tomorrow morning
1181906 wala pa yung flight information system yung mga computer information system medyo masalimuot we still dont have an integrated flight information system our computer information system is rather complicated
1181907 talagang para bang matatawag natin na bagong ipinanganak na sanggol maraming kailangan pa alagaan at ayusan ginagawa lahat na paraan para sa convenience ng pasahero this is all part of growing pains we have a lot of things to take care of were trying to address these problems
1181908 malaking dismayado ito kahihiyan ito na embarrass sa pangyayaring ito ang gobyerno ng pilipinas sapagkat ang lahat ay handa na ang lahat na imbitado para tetestigo sa formal signing ng moa ang magkabilang panig time and resources para sa pagpirma sa moa biglang lumabas itong tro ng korte suprema
1181909 this involves the lives of the entire bangsamoro people in mindanao kasamang apektado ang buhay ng napkaraming mamamayan sa mindanao na sakop nitong proposed bangsamoro juridical entity this will affect the lives of people in mindanao affected by the proposed bangsamoro juridical entity

1181911 fengshen was particularly destructive because it hit areas where typhoons are virtually unheard of many of the houses in the area were simply not built to withstand the weather they were faced with
1181912 it may sound unusual to ask people to rebuild their own homes but with the support and expertise the red cross is providing it is the most effective way of making sure everyone has a roof over their heads in the shortest possible time
1181913 but how can we explain to a family who have lost all their belongings that we cant support the reconstruction of their home simply because it was destroyed too early in the season the target beneficiaries are really the poorest of the poor and are in extreme need of our support with this grant we can now help another 1 500 families and that is excellent news
1181914 we are not trying to cause the economic collapse of the roman catholic church but to illustrate to the court the magnitude of the plot against our order
1181915 i was really hungry so i opened the side i dumped two in my mouth
1181916 definitely a live 3 4 inch to almost an inch green worm it looked kind of like a maggot
1181917 i dont know what they are i dont know if theyre eggs i dont know if theyre feces from the worm but whatever it is i ate that and thats not right
1181918 they were pretty calm about it their second question was how long in inches was the worm and im thinking maybe theyve got these calls before i dont know
1181919 they said well whats your address wed like to send you some coupons for more m amp ms
1181920 weve experienced a problem with burglaries at some of our jogging trails in the parking lots
1181921 they took my sub my amp my box and my cd player
1181922 its the third day in a row that emergency medical services emsa has issued a heat alert
1181923 this is probably one of the most thorough and detailed looks anyone has done for this website your ability to channel the user and get into their heads is scary in the really good way of course

1181927 sukhov nodded at him and jumped up on his own bunk like a squirrel he could finish off that bread now or smoke another cigarette or go to sleep if he wanted
1181928 i am proud to have dan quayle at my side
1181929 i didnt know in 1969 that i would be in this room today
1181930 as for how many sales this generates thats a difficult metric to measure
1181931 replace this machine and the reactor will return to normal
1181932 thats an awful lot of carbon we do not want emitted into the atmosphere professor mackay said
1181933 we need to look at forests through fresh eyes prof mackay said
1181934 the policy can no longer be blind to the green carbon thats in these natural forests he said
1181935 we need to start factoring in the carbon value of these forests when deciding what to do with them
1181936 we are unconvinced that the government have properly thought through this aspect of their proposed scheme
1181937 there is a risk that this will be perceived to undermine the independence of the judiciary
1181938 conflating the roles of parliament and the judiciary which would be quite inappropriate
1181939 far from being a system of checks and balances this is a recipe for confusion that places on parliament tasks that it cannot effectively fulfil and arguably risks undermining the rights of fair trial for the individuals concerned
1181940 considering that any debate will be highly political in nature and any vote may well be whipped by the political parties we are deeply concerned that the independence of the judiciary may appear to be undermined and that trials may be prejudiced
1181941 strike the correct balance between the right of everyone in the uk to be protected from terrorism and the need to preserve individual civil liberties
1181942 we will consider carefully the committees comments on the role of parliament in relation to pre charge detention
1181943 we believe however that it is right that parliament should have the opportunity to fully debate and approve the bringing into force of such an exceptional power
1181944 the government should abandon this measure and concentrate on delivering things that will actually make us safer such as allowing the use of intercept evidence in terror trials and establishing a dedicated uk border police force
1181945 it is very difficult to predict how the current market will play out and the full extent of its impact on the economy chief executive andrew penn said
1181946 in the meantime it will continue to be difficult for all of us in our industry
1181947 it is our job to focus on the long term because the long term trends in our industry continue to be attractive
1181948 once confidence is shaken and markets become fragile it does take a reasonable period of time for markets to recover from that mr penn said
1181949 we help clients to manage through these cycles if everything only went up then nobody would need organisations like us
1181950 the new zealand market continues to be very challenging mr penn said
1181951 hong kong clearly remains an attractive market and an important growth engine for us in the region mr penn said
1181952 our other asian operations continue to offer us exciting opportunities for growth
1181953 i think that sort of talk is absolutely unhelpful mr swan told abc radio
1181954 i think it is utterly irresponsible to speculate about that and i certainly wont be doing that
1181955 i certainly think australian home owners would welcome some relief but that is entirely a matter for the independent reserve bank he said
1181956 our may budget struck the right balance between fighting inflation on the one hand and investing in the future on the other he said
1181957 but we have perhaps the most difficult global conditions in over 25 years
1181958 the combination of tight financial conditions high petrol prices and low confidence is weighing heavily
1181959 the weakness in the leading index components relating to employment and new orders is concerning
1181960 in response to steadily declining new orders businesses are using existing inventories of finished goods to meet current demand for services
1181961 the latest employment sub index readings show that services firms are also re evaluating their staffing requirements in light of the economic slowdown

1181966 evolution is one of the reasons i dont believe in god
1181967 i think its scandalous how little our children are taught about evolution

1181969 he wrote letters and back the letters flowed from all around the world
1181970 we have nothing but bacteria all the way up here past middle c the dinosaurs dont come in till about here
1181971 the whole of human history would occupy a space of less than half a piano string right at the top of the keyboard
1181972 the amount of suffering in the natural world is beyond all decent contemplation during the minute that it takes me to say this millions of animals are running for their lives whimpering with fear thousands are dying from starvation or disease or feeling a parasite rasping away from within for most animals the reality is struggling suffering and death
1181973 i think ive got chicken legs and now dammit im making money outta these chicken legs
1181974 hes a veteran guy for us now and he knows the intensity we need to play with and win with and he sure had it on day one
1181975 oh yes i use google for searching all the time
1181976 we dont get too bummed out about it they the other players are working hard and were working hard ourselves to get something done and make ourselves better
1181977 youve just got to prepare yourself for it i dont think a lot about the pressure i just go out there and kick
1181978 he really works extremely hard and put on some weight in the off season
1181979 hes just a great competitor one of those kids you dont mind being the guy whos got the ball in his hands when the games on the line
1181980 they may have a few tricks up their sleeve with me in mind but i dont know of any yet
1181981 i think kyleis good enoughof an athlete that he allows us to take a look at those kinds of things when we install our game plans
1181982 were going to take what the other teams give us whether its on offense defense or special teams but its definitely nice to have a kid with his athleticism to give us some of those options

1181995 putin inherited a ransacked and bewildered country with a poor and demoralized people
1181996 and he started to do what was possible a slow and gradual restoration these efforts were not noticed nor appreciated immediately in any case one is hard pressed to find examples in history when steps by one country to restore its strength were met favorably by other governments
1181997 we are proud that alexander solzhenitsyn was our compatriot and contemporary
1181998 we will remember him as a strong courageous person with a great sense of dignity his activities as a writer and public figure his entire long thorny life journey will remain for us a model of true devotion selfless service to the people motherland and the ideals of freedom justice and humaneness
1181999 worked incessantly to form moral and spiritual ideals seeing them as an extremely important foundation supporting the state and society and fought for their triumph
1182000 but he spent his last day wonderfully he worked all day writing at his desk recently he told me that now he only worked eight hours a day when before he used to work for 16 he thought it was very little seven or eight hours and he complained about it

1182006 we were going to paint it this year but the fernley flood took care of the paint money
1182007 its just fun to sit here and hang out with the guys and look at all the cars
1182008 this is the super bowl as far as im concerned
1182009 there are a lot of great cars and a lot of great people thats why i come back here every year
1182010 we try to come every year i think i must have already taken a thousand photos
1182011 a huge number of people in reno sparks and washoe county will no longer have access to the information programming and media that was provided for them by federal law
1182012 unless a wide majority of viewers go out of their way to buy the digital box and actively search out the public education and government peg channels they will miss the opportunity to see what their local governments are doing
1182013 enjoy programming provided for them by program producers in the community
1182014 tmcc produced programming and put classes on the channel to start with

1182020 because many prostate cancers grow slowly early detection may not benefit a patients health and in some cases may even cause harm
1182021 we dont have any studies that show prostate cancer screening saves lives
1182022 there is no benefit to prostate cancer screening and we dont recommend it
1182023 my bottom line as a urologist is that healthy men with a life expectancy of more than 10 years regardless of their age should continue to be screened for prostate cancer yearly
1182024 i really dont think these new recommendations are going to change practice patterns
1182025 unequivocally all men at risk of prostate cancer must be tested annually with no exceptions
1182026 all of the experts agree if the first drug doesnt work the execution is going to be excruciating
1182027 just another avenue for us to highlight that barack obamas energy policy is completely out of touch with what americans need
1182028 hes playing politics at a time when america needs real leadership
1182029 he says inflate your tires and tune up your cars and we dont need to drill for offshore oil

1182115 please keep your hands off this problem as it is not a problem of the selangor state government i know he is the bandar tun razak kuala lumpur member of parliament but that does not give him the right to use the selangor state government machinery to get involved in issues in kuala lumpur
1182116 the menteri besar has also said that he was doing this because kampung baru was once part of selangor off course the whole of kuala lumpur was once part of selangor but does that give the selangor government the right to intervene in issues in kuala lumpur
1182117 we are doing no harm to the people in kampung baru we just want them to have a proper life like any other resident in the city
1182118 this is the problem with the opposition government they find fault with everything under the sun except themselves they think they are that perfect that whatever they do is right and whatever the barisan nasional government does is wrong this is their style of politics
1182119 for example our inefficiency in doing our jobs our extreme bureaucratic measures which make people hate us our actions which people think involved corruption or our decisions on the private sector or the people which were made too late
1182120 they foreign investors will not come if they have to face a higher cost due to the delay in the governments decision making process surely they would not like to accept this extra cost especially because it comes from the administration
1182121 dont let people think we are not responsible not trustworthy not caring at all or arrogant this will surely make them angry and this is not good because all these are our own doing
1182122 it is not because of europe or what is happening in america or other countries this is our own doing which we must avoid
1182123 we are the ones who determine our peace and stability not other countries not other people yes it may be difficult when we were facing various problems but it is still our responsibility to take care of political stability to ensure peace within our country
1182124 we have laws whose sovereignty we must uphold strongly our enforcement must be effective this is what we should do our responsibility no need to ask people from far to come here or accuse others for our inability to ensure peace and stability
1182125 dont delay why should we delay payment of the bills the works have been done the money now belong to others why would we want to keep it why should we delay when people are waiting
1182126 if it is delayed for three months the cost of business will increase they cannot make their payments to the banks when this happens the interests will become higher this is also our problem which makes people angry at us

1182226 donna barrs writing could not possibly be like her drawing because she draws faster than most people think it comes close in other ways though in an insupportable light barr has found a way as she does in her comics to create a world taken from her own brain which we nonetheless are certain we must have read about somewhere in some history book or other possessed of an uncanny knowledge of the european middle ages due to exhausting research or a past life she brings a village and a people several kinds of people to life and demonstrates with a writing style that is part poetry part irony how the very worst things can happen purely by happenstance to the most well meaning of souls is there a distant future echo in this book of homeland security or patriotism acts of shock and awe i fear so

1182281 wanneer bezoek je een mobiele nieuwssite bijvoorbeeld op het moment dat je in de trein zit en het nieuws wil checken dan wil je kort de meest actuele headlines of laatste updates met eventueel relevante afbeeldingen en videos zien en als je ergens meer over wil weten wil je ook direct duiding
1182282 zorg voor voldoende alineas en tussenkopjes zodat een tekst makkelijk te scannen is daarnaast geven kleine afbeeldingen tussen de tekst wat verstrooiing qua hyperlinks en verwijzingen naar andere media moet je opletten dat je niet naar iedere website kunt linken veel websites zijn namelijk minder of niet geschikt voor mobiele telefoons
1182283 de regels omtrent mobiele content gelden voor nu maar zullen met de ontwikkeling van de telefoons en data abonnementen ook mee moeten veranderen
1182284 we hebben nu erg vaak luchtig nieuws in die drie artikelen staan niet dat er helemaal geen luchtig nieuws op de mobiele website mag maar de eerste artikelen op de mobiele site mogen wat relevanter zijn dan op onze gewone site waar we ruimte hebben voor meer artikelen
1182285 voor de korte nieuwsberichten gebruiken we als basis teletekst voor de langere artikelen gebruiken we teksten van onze website de videoreportages zijn losse items uit het journaal die we hergebruiken of en hoe we uiteindelijk artikelen en reportages speciaal voor mobiel gaan bewerken of maken weet ik nog niet eerst willen we een groot onderzoek onder de gebruikers houden om te kijken wat aanslaat en wat niet
1182286 ik heb de wijsheid niet in pacht om te weten wat je op een mobiel wel en niet kunt doen ik denk dat niemand dat cht weet omdat er nog te weinig ervaring is opgedaan
1182287 een schaatswedstrijd is bijvoorbeeld goed te volgen maar wielrennen veel minder het scherm is bijvoorbeeld te klein voor een totaal shot je kunt de wielrenners dan slecht onderscheiden van gebruikers hoor ik ook dat ze de live stream die wij van de tour de france aanboden op hun mobiele telefoon vaak vooral gebruiken om het commentaar te horen
1182288 vergelijk het met het anp daar schrijven ze eerst een kop en versturen die die kop kun je zo smsen aissati naar ajax bijvoorbeeld daarna volgen teksten die steeds langer zijn en meer informatie bevatten n van de eerste en kortere takes zou je dan voor mobiel internet kunnen gebruiken de volgende voor de website en de langste bijvoorbeeld in de krant

1182344 the district court mistakenly limited its analysis primarily to the embodiment requirement
1182345 as a result of this error once it determined that the buffer data was clearly capable of being reproduced i e that the work was embodied in the buffer the district court concluded that the work was therefore fixed in the buffer and that a copy had thus been made
1182346 while our inquiry is necessarily fact specific and other factors not present here may alter the duration analysis significantly
1182347 these facts strongly suggest that the works in this case are embodied in the buffer for only a transitory period thus failing the duration requirement
1182348 cablevision we note also has subscribers who use home vcrs or dvrs like tivo and has significant control over the content recorded by these customers but this control is limited to the channels of programming available to a customer and not to the programs themselves cablevision has no control over what programs are made available on individual channels or when those programs will air if at all in this respect cablevision possesses far less control over recordable content than it does in the video on demand context where it actively selects and makes available beforehand the individual programs available for viewing for these reasons we are not inclined to say that cablevision rather than the user does the copying produced by the rs dvr system as a result we find that the district court erred in concluding that cablevision rather than its rs dvr customers makes the copies carried out by the rs dvr system
1182349 cablevision argues that because each rs dvr transmission is made using a single unique copy of a work made by an individual subscriber one that can be decoded exclusively by that subscribers cable box only one subscriber is capable of receiving any given rs dvr transmission
1182350 those who defended summers seemed to have some powerful data on their side pointing to the sat scores to explain why men perform both better and worse than women in math the bell curve was shallower for men there were more dunces at one tail of the curve and geniuses at the other than there were in the curve for women
1182351 another mistake made by those who defended summers theory is the conviction that these test scores are measuring something innate when there is a lot of evidence to suggest otherwise one of the most persuasive arguments is that the gap between the genders is diminishing girls now score higher on these tests than they did twenty years ago and even twenty years ago they did better than they had done fifty years ago if the tests were measuring innate talent we would not see significant differences from one generation to the next even if there werent problems with using test scores as a proxy for talent at the highest levels in science the evidence suggesting that the measured differences are innate is from an academic point of view woefully weak as the nas noted the gap between males and females at the very highest end of mathematical ability is narrowing
1182352 moreover there is no such difference between test scores in japan while in iceland women do better than men if you reduce mathematical ability to gender differences you have to find a plausible way of explaining away these highly inconvenient facts
1182353 what these critics missed is that there are real problems with using sat scores or other test scores as a proxy for mathematical ability and intelligence at the highest level

1182399 back in january i made a financial forecast for 2008 in this post i will update my analysis looking both at what has happened thus far in 2008 and refining what is likely ahead most forecasts are made with an overriding assumption of infinite growth but the analysis made in january and updated now maintains an underlying assumption of resource limitations such as will likely accompany the advent of peak oil under resource limitations debtors are likely to find it difficult to pay back loans as resources become more and more scarce as a result default rates are likely to continue to rise one of the issues i consider important in my forecast is systemic risk this relates to the interconnectedness of the system and predicts that if one part fails other parts are also likely to fail many other articles mention this issue but rarely address its full ramifications
1182400 so ive established that our oil food and financial sectors are currently spiraling out of control what to do about it i believe that all three problems are interlocked and though all need to be fixed a serious positive development on any one of the three will have beneficial effects on the others if the value of the dollar strengthens that will automatically have a beneficial impact on how much oil we can buy for a dollar decreases in the price of grain and or oil will strengthen the dollar there is no reason we need to attack these problems sequentially they can be addressed simultaneously

1182403 the chvi is a great example of creative public policy
1182404 by bringing together the public resources of the government of canada and the private capabilities of the gates foundation this initiative can accelerate progress being made in the global fight against hiv our goal as the implementation advisory board will be to leverage the strengths and ideas of the public private and philanthropic sectors to ensure that this initiative moves quickly and has the maximum possible impact
1182405 canada is committed to working with the global community to effectively respond to hiv aids
1182406 our support is achieving results and having a life saving impact on people around the world for people living with hiv aids these funds will go towards programs that help them to live longer and better lives for those at risk of infection this investment will help to provide the education and prevention tools needed to protect themselves against hiv aids
1182407 canadas investments in hiv aids prevention treatment and care initiatives are an integral part of helping to improve the health of the worlds poor

1182429 we have suspended freddy and marques for the first two games of the season
1182430 while the athletic department policy in development for addressing these types of issues calls for a one game suspension i felt that a two game suspension was appropriate in both of these cases i want to continue to send a strong message that this type of behavior wont be tolerated in this football program

1182432 with the exception of one loan which defaulted in the first quarter of 2008 that we fully reserved for this quarter the credit quality of our loan portfolio appears to be stable in the current credit environment we have increased our general reserves but feel confident that our portfolio quality is intact although our prepayments this quarter were virtually non existent we expect that prepayments will increase based upon our conversations with several of our borrowers as these prepayments occur we will be able to continue to reinvest at very attractive spreads thereby increasing portfolio income and realizing exit fees we also worked hard to eliminate all but 880 000 of short term recourse liabilities

1182441 joe adams and jarius wright are two guys that can play outside and really have good quicks and can change direction and i think theyre playmakers
1182442 and thats something we necessarily were missing a little bit in spring ball two guys that go make big plays then youve got childs and chris gragg inside that are two big kids
1182443 those four when you see them walking around kind of remind you what a lot of our receiving groups ended up being at louisville two real fasts and two real physical guys so thats exciting to me and weve just got to get out on the field and see what they can do
1182444 theres no question about that we came out of all spring ball marques wade was our starting z receiver so all of a sudden now we need to find a new starter and give somebody else an opportunity thats the biggest thing when someoe else has to sit down another person gets an opportunity
1182445 linebacker is thinned out i think burtons suspension affects us more special team wise burton did a real nice job in the spring starting on a number of special teams and a backup at lb so it hurts us more special teams for both of them than it does anything else

1182518 the whole situation the timing was bad theres no question about that i couldve played out any other way i wouldve loved to see it play out another way with the falcons and with arkansas its the only way it couldve played out
1182519 it was a trying situation everybody there worked as hard as they could to do the best job they could
1182520 it was a difficult situation its something ive put behind me the falcons have i wish them and the entire organization the best of luck its time to focus in on this season university of arkansas football and the players we have

1182582 with skyrocketing newsprint and fuel prices the writing was on the wall that we were going to have to do something drastic to keep our expenses in line
1182583 to cut one publishing day has been one of the most difficult decisions of my 43 year career at the sentinel i have wrestled for some time with this and ultimately had to come to the realization that in order to remain financially stable i had no choice but to eliminate our weakest publishing day
1182584 i think were doing the right thing by taking the steps to come here today
1182585 i know she would want me to do the right thing and thats what im going to do
1182586 we expected her to make full progress through this with my grandma still being here
1182587 that did not happen and we want to get to the bottom of it
1182588 she was not able to talk with her voice but she was able to talk with her lips
1182589 i believe that the federal government is no longer of by and for the people
1182590 so i think that we have no choice but to represent ourselves thats what i did by going to washington dc last year i was representing myself in the halls of congress
1182591 i would like to return to a time when civil liberties were not wisked away at the whim of politicians when the voice of individuals carried more weight than the influence of corporate power and when american ingenuity was relied upon to solve our problems instead we have been told by government that citizens need to be spied on for our own security offshore oil rigs and coal burning power plants are preferable to windmills and solar panels and that we have no choice but to borrow billions of dollars from foreign investors i believe we do have other choices than those being presented to us by the status quo so i am asking the people of southwest missouri to vote outside the box when they go to the polls in november
1182592 i realized when i ran for congress in 2006 that there is no way i can raise the amount of money that an incumbent spends to get re elected
1182593 the only way i can compete against a career politician like congressman blunt who is showered with cash from corporate lobbyists is by creating unique ways to illustrate my positions on the issues that are important to the people of southwest missouri
1182594 i love the educational atmosphere its great to learn from folks who are eager to learn themselves their ability to relate their experiences to the course material was really effective

1182597 suddenly i saw james run and people trying to protect him from state security officers

1182599 i told him dont worry we didnt do anything wrong well go in and get out right away i really did believe that this would happen

1182601 maree is a kind man with a quiet gentle voice who held my hand as we ran through the streets under police siege when we got hit with tear gas mohammed negotiated safe houses for us to go in and wash our eyes when a passing train a few feet away was hit with rocks and i cowered in fear he covered my body with his
1182602 they made a report saying that were against the government and that we encouraged the people in mahalla to destroy things and other charges
1182603 when he read the report he called another prosecutor and they laughed
1182604 when we approached the main door of the building there were a lot of people from state security waiting for us
1182605 they said james can go but we need you mohamed we need to finish the release procedures
1182606 we tried to escape to go back inside but they took us back to the police station
1182607 just as i went in through the door of the state security building someone behind me lifted me by my belt very hard he then blindfolded me and tied my hands behind my back took my wallet and my mobile and insulted me repeatedly
1182608 they took me to the 2nd floor of the building and this time i was very afraid they told me to sit on the ground i heard a lot of people screaming they were being electrocuted i could hear the sound of the machine
1182609 a voice near my ear said put him in the oven and after that put him on the pole a reference to sodomy i felt like i had died someone kicked me while i was on the ground
1182610 i spent an hour in the room before they took me to an officer i could hardly walk because i was so scared
1182611 before i went in his office voices said there is electricity on the ground jump you son of a or youll be electrocuted i jumped but there was nothing
1182612 they insulted me again you traitor you work with foreigners youre going to die from electric shocks
1182613 i was taken back outside and started coughing and couldnt breathe
1182614 i took off my blindfold and someone kicked my leg then he handcuffed my hand really tight so tight that i lost feeling in it they took me to a cell downstairs
1182615 i begged him to loosen the handcuff slightly and he did i didnt have a blanket i was on my own the floor was rough and i was still handcuffed behind my back i couldnt sleep
1182616 they told me that youre going to die here and well bury you in this cell i believed them
1182617 the convention makes clear that the use of performance enhancing drugs to gain a competitive advantage undercuts the positive attributes of sport
1182618 and further by these my son be admonished of making of many blogs there is no end and of much reading of blogs is a weariness of the flesh
1182619 and further by these my son be admonished of making of many blogs there is no end and of much reading of blogs is a weariness of the flesh
1182620 the reputation of this team has been damaged no question
1182621 i dont think its beyond repair and i dont think the reputation has been ruined but certainly it has taken some hits
1182622 i would like to let everybody know that i apologize for my actions
1182623 i apologize to st marys and i apologize to my teammates and to bulldog fans i made a bad decision my teammates were hurt and i just overreacted
1182624 you feel sad and sick that one of the guys youre an authority figure over and you care about got himself in trouble
1182625 you also hate the fact those guys do represent this program and this program represents this university and this university represents this state it represents anybody who claims to be a bulldog i feel sick about that
1182626 i mean theres no way you can say it hasnt been a distraction because it has been
1182627 if a guy has a first time offense i dont believe in throwing that guy under the bus to try to stave off the wolves so to speak
1182628 i dont think its fair to the guy dewberry for example i dont think i should throw dewberry off the football team ive never had a problem with darius dewberry
1182629 we will look into other ways of making sure we do a better job
1182630 i dont know if i would blame him for it with whats gone on this offseason
1182631 downtown that can be fun for a lot of guys but the team and what were able to do this season is a lot more important than going out and having fun with college students
1182632 my degree wasnt worth enough for me to get into a better job in d c or baltimore georgetown and the ivies have a chokehold
1182633 the first day of practice is pretty exciting as a coach you get involved in certain drills i like getting in the middle of it i like coaching and teaching
1182634 were not in game shape but were in a lot better shape than we were in the spring
1182635 any time you have inexperience on one side of the ball or the other you hope the other side will make up for some of the mistakes you know are going to happen
1182636 were going to make mistakes on offense but we have to keep them to a minimum and not make big mistakes and our defense and our special teams has to be outstanding
1182637 we knew there were certain strides we had to take
1182638 i think everybody felt a little better today all of us vying for the starting quarterbacks job are trying to do what we can to get on the field and play and show the coaches that we should be the guy
1182639 we had one intent and that is to build the event
1182640 i dont know anything about those reports and even if i did its not something we could comment about
1182641 our performance reflects the growing momentum behind this company after two years of repositioning our brand and reinventing the guest experience
1182642 while we still have a considerable portion of our season in front of us im encouraged by the results especially in the current economic climate
1182643 i dont need no fuckin stage to use my free speech ya idiots
1182644 my degree wasnt worth enough for me to get into a better job in d c or baltimore georgetown and the ivies have a chokehold
1182645 we have tried to draw the attention of the public to fraudulent tickets
1182646 very supportive of any investigation into cases of fraudulent tickets or any illegal activities related to the sale of tickets
1182647 we are taking this action to protect consumers from web site operators who may be engaged in fraudulent efforts to sell tickets that don t exist
1182648 it is important for consumers to recognize that in the united states the only authorized and licensed entity for the sale of olympic tickets online is cosport
1182649 well were not really making fun of disabled people were making fun of blah blah
1182650 its not batman that makes you worthwhile its the other way around never tell yourself anything different

1182652 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1182653 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1182654 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1182655 he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact he raised more than one million dollars from big oil just last month
1182656 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1182657 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires
1182658 yahoo did not participate in the execution of the votes and was not a party to any errors which may have been made either by a voting institution or a proxy processing intermediary acting on behalf of banks brokers and institutions
1182659 it is do with national pride it does become the first gold medal of the games
1182660 for every games there is that sense that we are presenting the nation to the world and that really has been probably since 1980 when the games started to become a big television deal
1182661 any kind of demonstration or political religious or racial propaganda in any olympic sites venues or other areas
1182662 the purpose of hosting the olympics is to prove to the chinese people that the rest of the world acknowledges the chinese communist party as legitimate leaders
1182663 the city is an appealing place to visit and its quality of life was attractive to the companys employees
1182664 in the morning we work on the physical elements and do some work in the gym then we are into the water we grab some lunch and then get back in the water until 7 or 8 at night until everything is perfect or near perfect
1182665 i was the sort of child that you always had to drag out of the water
1182666 when they did get me out my lips were purple and my skin like a prune
1182667 i have always found it easy to move in the water and when i am not in it for two or three days my bones hurt i need to be in the water all the time
1182668 we cant wait to get started as you always get a bit anxious in the run up to big events
1182669 physically we are in good form so now we need to rest a bit but im confident that we will swim very well when we get there
1182670 i think we have been training hard we have changed a few things in the choreography and the coach is very happy with what weve been doing i think we can do very well
1182671 in beijing the objective is to get amongst the medals and get as near as possible to perfection and the gold
1182672 at the moment we think that are the strongest team and we need to get as near as possible to them united states will be somewhere thereabouts too
1182673 bronze might be a bit disappointing even though i have never won a medal before silver would be great and if we won gold it would be a dream come true
1182674 if the russians make mistakes and we do the best possible we could win but the silver is the most realistic option
1182675 in the last four years there have been a lot of experiences for me outside of judo which have expanded my potential
1182676 its like meeting your first love again after eight years apart
1182677 she pushes and pushes and then at the end she stings
1182678 it is because she is so key to the teams morale
1182679 this is my fifth olympics and every competition i want to do my best for all the fans
1182680 im very proud of what america represents to the world but this is a basketball game not life or death olympic sports should be about unity friendships and bringing the best athletes on the planet together
1182681 i just play basketball as a russian so nothing has really changed in my life outside of just playing basketball as a russian
1182682 my parents were the big concern i didnt want them thinking their son is a traitor
1182683 i felt i was missing something is the only thing i had in my life
1182684 essa gama de nomes de relevo do cinema contempor neo nos apresentam hist rias que v o do melodrama ao
1182685 i guess jerry yang didnt come out of the meeting as unscathed as it seemed
1182686 her dream has always been to give single parents a safe nurturing and affordable daycare that provides clothing food overnight care mentoring and constant education to the children
1182687 her dream has always been to give single parents a safe nurturing and affordable daycare that provides clothing food overnight care mentoring and constant education to the children
1182688 its necessary to put in place regulations that will allow the fbi to transform itself into an intelligence gathering organization in addition to just a crime solving organization
1182689 gone under the surface of the water and not come up
1182690 deputies along with bystanders were able to cut him free
1182691 im saving 50 a week on gas and ive lost another 20 pounds
1182692 the stress relief from not sitting in traffic is a bonus
1182693 im glad this challenge gave me this little oomph to go the extra step
1182694 i feel much more alert when i come to work in the morning like im on from the beginning of the day
1182695 its such a nice pace and a great way to get to know orange county
1182696 the first day i thought i just wont pedal that hard and i wont need to shower when i get to work
1182697 but i did need that shower its quite a workout
1182698 we are concerned for her health and wellbeing and it is really up to her family now to speak further about any of her medical or personal concerns
1182699 the incident itself is a call and a cry for help and i hope and expect that the premier through to the vast majority of the tasmanian community will all be extending their wishes for a fast and speedy recovery
1182700 playing cricket in new zealand has always been something ive wanted to do as i love the country and otago seemed an obvious destination with such a talented playing list that will be looking for success
1182701 after my experiences playing odi and twenty20 cricket for england and in the ipl with the rajasthan royals i really feel like i have something to offer in terms of leadership and experience
1182702 the olympics would be the greatest vehicle to spread the game worldwide and it would be a logical fit
1182703 when you think of the olympics you also think of the big nations like the us russia and now china
1182704 those regions are clearly potential growth opportunities for cricket and we see twenty20 at the olympics as a superb vehicle
1182705 suspicion of distribution or exhibition of lewd material to a minor and annoying or molesting a child under 18
1182706 you told me i would be your date for prom and you took her
1182707 dude do you think you could help get our english teachers hand out of my crotch shes really digging in
1182708 um buffy you maybe want to help a brother out
1182709 over us 20 a barrel drop that should have translated into a much greater drop in the price of petrol at the bowsers
1182710 i found this amusing they were saying biggest drop theyd seen in four years
1182711 it should have been more theyre patting themselves on the back but theyre still ripping motorists off
1182712 i think were going to see petrol prices continue to go down
1182713 i think well go down to the lower 100s and that should see us with petrol prices back into the 1 20 per litre
1182714 but at the moment were still a few cents over what we should be
1182715 the reason this fine is so high is that sadly the company was warned about this matter there had been a similar incident some time before the problem had been identified and the problem wasnt fixed
1182716 this problem was known and it wasnt fixed until a man died that is what makes this case so serious
1182717 i would just like to say at fosters we are shocked and saddened by this terrible tragedy
1182718 our heart goes out to cuus family they have lost a husband they have lost a father and our workmates have lost a very respected member of abbotsford workforce
1182719 i understand that there will be a big debate about some of these issues but im not going to stand by and watch the koala population of south east queensland simply dwindle into oblivion
1182720 these are icon species the koala is one of the great symbols of our country
1182721 dogs are an issue up to a point but the bigger issue is that were taking away the koalas habitat
1182722 theres an elephant in the room and this is sort of like a nice diversion
1182723 the decision came about mainly because queensland rail has to accept the fact and acknowledge the fact that the railway system is not safe and that scott is not the first one to be attacked and is certainly not the last one
1182724 we just want queensland rail to acknowledge that they were in the wrong and what theyve done is not enough
1182725 commodities had falls of around 6 per cent and this has affected our resources stocks
1182726 no further evacuations are planned at this time and based on current information and forecast we do not expect any impact on shell operated production in the gulf of mexico
1182727 exxonmobil is determining which of its facilities may potentially be in the path of the storm preparing those structures for heavy wind and rain and identifying personnel for possible evacuation to shore
1182728 it is just a frank reality we have to do something
1182729 people have had to make some drastic changes in their own life so they are ready to see the government make some choices
1182730 tapping the strategic oil reserve is not a substitute for a real plan to increase supply through additional drilling and nuclear power
1182731 the strategic oil reserve exists for americas national security strategy not barack obamas election strategy
1182732 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1182733 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1182734 we talk more about art than business and hopefully introducing us to that part of london artists like damien hirst tracey emin and sam taylor wood
1182735 his tenacity is something we admire because its something we have had from day one always trying to do something new and when were worried about money and how much it is going to cost to record there he reminds us well be able to use the studio he is building there
1182736 to get a leg up from elton john is an awesome thing made better because hes not one of those pompous rich guys hes totally normal and into art and music

1182742 los medios tambi n tienen una deudita pendiente con nosotros
1182743 the problem had been identified and the problem wasnt fixed and thats what added to the severity of this particular incident
1182744 it is very difficult to predict how the current market will play out and the full extent of its impact on the economy
1182745 in the meantime it will continue to be difficult for all of us in our industry
1182746 it is our job to focus on the long term because the long term trends in our industry continue to be attractive
1182747 once confidence is shaken and markets become fragile it does take a reasonable period of time for markets to recover from that
1182748 we help clients to manage through these cycles if everything only went up then nobody would need organisations like us
1182749 hong kong clearly remains an attractive market and an important growth engine for us in the region
1182750 our other asian operations continue to offer us exciting opportunities for growth
1182751 we cant let little countries screw around with big companies like this companies that have made big investments around the world
1182752 i think thats appropriate because there are a lot of bad guys out there but a recent study showed 80 percent of data leakage problems actually came from within
1182753 i will lose my job if i put you on that flight
1182754 i can only put you on that flight if you pay a new fare as those are two different destinations
1182755 i am not going to lose my job by breaking the rules i would be fired if i put you on that lga flight
1182756 i can only put you on that flight if you pay a new fare as those are two different destinations
1182757 i am not going to lose my job by breaking the rules i would be fired if i put you on that lga flight
1182758 if you think youre at risk of losing your job by rebooking me to lga wait until i tell your supervisor that you refused to do so
1182759 we are doing a good job we dont need to apologize for being a coal miner i am proud to be a coal miner we dont need to apologize for being a coal miner
1182760 we were able to stop that stream saver bill from coming out of committee because our people wrote and we processed 1 150 000 letters that we took to those legislators
1182761 this act would cover the division of property between same sex couples however it would not cover parenting in relation to same sex couples and we believe this is really important for issues such as child support say on the breakdown of a same sex relationship

1182772 if you see bernard up there tell him i said hello and i miss him
1182773 i was crushed when he left to be honest with you he was a great football player in his prime and getting ready to play better it was a huge loss for us and hes going to have a huge impact in minnesota with that running game they have and bernard on the outside
1182774 we definitely think devin hester can be a no 1 receiver for us
1182775 i wouldnt doubt anything that devin hester could do whether its returning punts taking a couple of snaps at quarterback playing cornerback i think hell be able to figure it out
1182776 i cant call myself a no 1 receiver right now
1182777 im just playing ball as for the money its no more pressure thats money ive earned the past two years thats money i deserved for what i did
1182778 bernard is a star player an impact player who is going to do what impact players do make big plays
1182779 with devin you go from one type of impact player to another you put the ball in devins hands hes going to find a way to score too
1182780 whats exciting is well get him on the field a lot more
1182781 because hes a return guy he wont be on the field for 65 plays like bernard was
1182782 i feel like what happened was a blessing in disguise
1182783 this is something i think has brought this team closer together you may think i sound crazy for saying that but i really think this is bigger than me and steve
1182784 i think that was a big step for this team to accomplish the goals we wanted to accomplish
1182785 because i felt like if i didnt forgive him then it would divide the team up and we could pretty much throw this season away
1182786 he expects to catch every ball and i expect to defend every ball
1182787 when you have those two types of individuals something has to give when its 100 degrees out there and youre tired and youre frustrated sometimes emotions get involved
1182788 im sure if he had a calmer head he would have made better decisions i dont fault him for that there are times where i may want to hit somebody but i control myself i tell some of my other teammates you have to learn to keep your composure typically people do crazy things they regret when theyre emotional i think he just got too emotional at the time
1182789 lucs a standup guy and i commend him for everything hes done in this whole ordeal
1182790 and were behind steve hes still one of ours i have a daughter and if she does something that i dont like of course im going to be mad but at the end of the day shes still my daughter and im still going to love her hes still part of this team and hes still our family so were still behind him
1182791 please dont stop its lonely at the top these lonely days when will they ever stop
1182792 maybe 1 maybe 2 but the moment you smell his armpits each hug seems like a hundred
1182793 no one really knows anyone that can count doesnt want to hug a hippie
1182794 it is obviously something bigger the name of the game is to decapitate the iranian nuclear program whether it is aimed at a weapon or not
1182795 thats how some of their role models the singers and the actresses tend to dress and thats why we have a bigger problem with the young ladies
1182796 i do see girls in really tiny shorts and stilettos and im like ok
1182797 said they said that the schools standards are not strict but that their mothers dress code was enforced during a back to school shopping trip on sunday
1182798 i want them to be fashionable but we did have some things that were approved and werent approved
1182799 there were a couple shirts that were a little too low cut a little too short or too low rise or you had to do the bend over test to make sure your butt crack doesnt show
1182800 carefree sex crazed i dont care what they look like smell like after ive had a 6 pack
1182801 i needed money to play the game every day my parents give me only 100 baht a day which is not enough i am also fed up with them fighting they are civil servants and do not make good money
1182802 today saturday my mother gave me 500 baht so in the evening i went to the lotus superstore and bought knives

1182808 they wont expand as much as they did with air in it so the tire pressure will be more constant
1182809 all the race cars use it because they want that tire pressure exactly where they want it and they want it to stay that way when they go around the track and the tire is hot
1182810 the original car manufacturers arent putting it in the tires the tire manufacturers themselves are not specifically recommending it for the tires
1182811 problems are never solved at the level of thinking that created them
1182812 is there nothing to be said of having the foresight and intelligence to use the most fruitful modalities for expressing your thoughts
1182813 if a writer truly wishes to provide his thoughts vision or story to the masses for the sort of consumption that vivifies the meaning of the time they spent he should mindfully choose to craft his work in a way which would be most readily understood while still maintaining balance to his art
1182814 it may be true that well written is well thought but that need not necessitate linguistical acrobatics which send your work into an endless display of complexity and nearly meaningless obscurity
1182815 until there is a more complete consensus on those queries intelligent people will always have contentions over their meanings so there may be a distinction but i fail to see why it is relevant to the terms of this arena
1182816 an easy read is not art because art cannot be found in an unoriginal thought
1182817 so big deal andy warhol big deal pet rock where do we go now is not there more inherent value in one thing more than another and further just because weve removed god from the equation why does that necissitate removing the idea of inherent value from a thing thinkers have sort have made this general assumption that the two things go hand in hand and there is no purpose in inherent value and i believe there is more now
1182818 the whole purpose behind it is to give back to an organization that has given me and my family particularly my son so much
1182819 his heart was so weak they were concerned he would arrest
1182820 he was showing most signs that he wouldnt improve either
1182821 to see him going into the surgery room was tough
1182822 but ty was smiling he was ready the attitude hes had the whole time is amazing
1182823 they recognize you feel helpless and make you feel more secure
1182824 i think ty was comfortable and confident he was in good hands
1182825 ive always been a donor ive always felt it was an important thing to be a donor
1182826 the fact you can give someone an opportunity to live a normal life is a gift
1182827 i cannot stress enough about that organization the level of care and caring that comes through is so evident to the families coming in and out of there
1182828 i just want the community to know how much the childrens hospital has positively affected my family and i want to bring awareness to the cause
1182829 if folks feel compelled to donate we would love to see it
1182830 hospitals and hospital employees in the news around the state
1182831 dr hardy thought it could be done and should be done and he made a moral case for it
1182832 this experience opened the way for further human lung transplants

1182836 as an accommodation provider i thought this would be great for us but knowing what the zoo is like i was in two minds as to whether the zoo was the right place for it
1182837 considering the amount of land we have here i thought you could have a theme park but build it elsewhere
1182838 the innocence of the zoo is pristine people go there and rave about it weve had people from overseas americans canadians and new zealanders and they come back raving about the place because theres nothing like it in their own country
1182839 melbourne needs a theme park and the western suburbs is the ideal place for it we need another major attraction
1182840 i think there needs to be a definite push for tourism as opposed to just pushing the area

1182842 i really do believe it is the proximity to melbourne being only 20 minutes up the road

1182874 phelps has earned every bit of the big sponsorship and financial backing he receives because the olympic golds he has won were down to his ability and hard work
1182875 i dont feel any envy over the hype he receives at all
1182876 i have plenty of respect for michael phelps and what he has achieved but im not afraid to get in the pool and race him everyone is beatable be it today tomorrow or in four years time my first aim is to get into the final once youre there anything can happen

1182948 if you are a mockist you will often prefer to follow the law of demeter because it makes mocking much easier however classicists dont seem to mind as much since they can use train wreck syntax for state based tests without any pain being a mockist or classicist seems to greatly influence a persons opinion on whether or not to follow the law of demeter
1182949 more formally the law of demeter for functions requires that a method m of an object o
1182950 may only invoke the methods of the following kinds of objects 1 o itself

1183003 after finally deciding to get professional help i felt like maybe talking about my situation could be a blessing to someone else going through the same things
1183004 regardless of whether youre a celebrity or you play for the philadelphia eagles and youre in the limelight you still go through problems
1183005 a lot of things in my life have happened even since ive come to philadelphia
1183006 random people have pulled out a gun on me one time during the playoffs some guy walked from around a building and said youre going to the pro bowl blank him hes not going to the pro bowl luckily i was talking to someone and i didnt hear him if i heard it i think id have been on the ground
1183007 ive just had a lot of thoughts and questions going through my mind about a lot of things
1183008 some things im embarrassed to talk about but even dating back to when i was growing up people made fun of me i always wanted people to think i was more than what i was
1183009 when i got into the nfl i wanted to be man enough to admit that but i tried to use material things to say who i was i know now that some of the happiest times in my life were when i didnt have a pot to piss in im hoping this is just part of my growing process
1183010 ive never been a big fan of medication but at this point in my life i feel like every little bit helps i was at the end of the road
1183011 i didnt want anybody to see me walking into a psych clinic professionals arent always the answer sometimes just talking things out helps and now with all the rumors coming out it has only made things worse some of the comments really got to me you always hear guys say that they dont care what people think and sometimes i dont about certain things but in the grand scheme i want people to think positive about me
1183012 i would have been there physically but mentally i wouldnt have been an asset to my team or myself i could have got myself or one of my teammates hurt
1183013 for a while i didnt work out and i didnt put my weight back on
1183014 i went about a month and i only gained two pounds but i started working out again and that helped me through some things im still 335 and in shape
1183015 i really do miss a lot of aspects of the game but my story everything is real if i sit here and lie to you im lying to myself hopefully the doctor will give me the ok to play but i wont everything is ok if it isnt
1183016 thats college money for my son but whatever the number is that hasnt been my focus
1183017 i know the value of a dollar i come from a household of four where the weekly income was 200 or 300 dollars a week i just felt my mental health was more important than a dollar
1183018 i think every time weve talked he became more sensitive that i do have issues going on
1183019 ill admit that i said some things around my teammates that have created some of the rumors that have been going on but a lot of that was said out of anger i said i might give football up because i didnt know how to handle my anger this really has taken a toll on me mentally

1183027 im thinking that shes probably been there for a number of years
1183028 part of the mystery here is that apparently none of these children were in school

1183044 joann mcfatter an issachar school instructor got into some stuff that seems kind of whacky to me and apparently chuck wasnt there in the room dna hold memory sins etc we can talk with animals then the plants have emotions that was the 2nd time id heard that in 2 months time when i heard that on the dvd are you guys getting a little out there or am i being stretched i trust chuck and robert absolutely implicitly i trust robert because chuck does however i can find nothing in scripture that says plants have emotions and we can talk with the animals true i find nothing in scripture on other things too but this i am questioning joann goes on to say when a word is released from a mouth in heaven comes a numeric equation music a color of light a fragrance huh then she says what new agers say fragrances have frequencies so tell me am i to believe what joann says if so then most of what the newagers say is right on then how do i tell the difference between what is godly and what is satanic joann mcfatter says the trees talked to her at a church the dvd blanked out where she said something about walking on water and how we can pass through a wall chuck pierce says sounds are connected with everything and every tabernacle how do i find out what sound is connected with me chuck pierce said when starting to talk on movement im sure joann has taught on this no she hadnt not at all joann tends to go on and on and on so what musical notes go with what essential oils joann mentioned something about it and if there is one note god tells me about say for coriander is that the same note worldwide or just for that person and who is to determine which notes go with what fragrances joann says colors heal so do non christians she says paintings heal and everyone has lots of creativity i knew that and am so glad someone else says it to back me up this dvd set skips and goes back and forth and blanks out when joann is talking mostly i think its totally irresponsible of glory of zion chuck pierce robert heidler and joann mcfatter to say all of the above and yet not explain anything to expect people to take what they say on face value without any explanations or reasonings just nothing

1183062 there are bad laws and cruel laws and the people who enforce them are both bad and cruel
1183063 with the first link the chain is forged the first speech censored the first thought forbidden the first freedom denied chains us all irrevocably
1183064 but the limit of tolerance for these human foibles is obtained when the proponent of a questionable scientific doctrine endeavors to maintain it against all possible odds by misrepresentation misinformation and suppression of contradictory data and by insinuating unfairness in opponents of his views
1183065 man stands alone in the universe a unique product of a long unconcious impersonal material process with unique understanding and potentialities these he owes to no one but himself and it is to himself that he is responsible he is not the creature of uncontrollable and undeterminable forces but his own master he can and must decide and manage his own destiny
1183066 we remain cautious on the economic outlook although our large customer base geographic diversity and strong product offering provide good support for our businesses going forward
1183067 the acquisition has a perfect fit with our operations in europe
1183068 we now get a foothold in russia and we will use that platform to introduce many of our pipeline products
1183069 our focus is the north american market and we believe that this transaction will enable valeant to better focus on its key strategic markets and products
1183070 valeant has been a company with too many products operating in too many countries narrowing its focus to core geographies especially north america is a sound strategic move in our view
1183071 ultimately the real economy will recover from this crisis although it may get worse before it gets better
1183072 the area that is causing some concern is that although its asian growth is good it is slower than it was and if you extrapolate from that then growth is going to be really slow
1183073 this result is in line with our expectations and represents a relatively resilient performance given current market conditions
1183074 humanas original assumptions about the severity of mispricing in the prescription drug plan business have turned out to be conservative we are raising our 2008 expected earnings to 4 35 from 4 10 and expected 2009 earnings expectations to 5 90 from 5 60

1183078 theyre not spending on meals theyre having a quick takeaway and theyre not buying breakfast so yes youre missing out there too
1183079 i had a one of my regular customers and he comes up from near nowra and he goes down to melbourne five times a year to see the kids and grandkids
1183080 he said were now only doing it two times a year now we just cant afford it people in general in the town that work casual wise are not getting the work because small business cant afford to employ them and are getting cut back to two or three hours a day if theyre lucky
1183081 there appears to be a lot of day tripping going on they come for the day
1183082 they dont have the money for accommodation long drives etc
1183083 the federal governments got to put their hand up and try and help them out
1183084 my solution is batten down hatches and just struggle through and just hope it becomes better thats the scot in me
1183085 i just found it amazing that they investigators didnt take fingerprints or do any testing at all
1183086 to me i just felt that what they did was just identify the men they looked at their wallets and saw how much money they had on them but that was their main concern
1183087 the advice was the vessel having been exposed to the sea elements for five days does extremely limit the possibility of the recovering of fingerprints
1183088 that plus the lack of obvious signs of struggle or violence on board led to the decision not to take fingerprints
1183089 my advice is that it is not a product that you spray everywhere and see what comes up it is used sparingly on a site where there are obvious signs
1183090 its not black and white and its not as you see on television spray a bit of this and theres your criminal
1183091 they allowed themselves six to eight weeks to get back to fremantle but because des and jimmy were retired it didnt really matter how long they took they didnt want to sail at night for safety reasons

1183095 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than we imagined
1183096 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date
1183097 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction
1183098 tea is not a product its a practice what the asians call the way no pleasure is simpler no luxury cheaper no consciousness altering substance more benign
1183099 the current regulatory regime is totally insufficient to prevent these ongoing credit card abuses
1183100 stronger consumer protections and clearer prohibitions against unfair and deceptive credit card lending practices are long overdue
1183101 with the maintained guidance delhaize still has to deliver good results in the second half with targeted benefits from store openings new private label product introductions and cost savings said ing wholesale banking analyst john david roeg in a note to investors
1183102 the shares are up because it has confirmed its guidance
1183103 otherwise this is a traditional supermarket chain suffering from consumers switch to discount stores like wal mart in the u s on the back of weaker consumer expenditure
1183104 if consumer consumption slows further and for longer delhaize will try to improve its growth by lowering prices
1183105 they have already cut the price of 15 000 items in the u s and are doing the same in belgium the company is being affected by consumers looking for cheaper alternatives

1183115 hey the yanks need to be in the playoff hunt
1183116 you got a guy coming up there who cant hit water if he fell out of a boat
1183117 ive been a rangers fan all my life and i can tell you theres been plenty of fucking crying in baseball
1183118 if i buy this team chris davis will end up suing me for sexual harassment

1183121 ive been a rangers fan all my life and i can tell you theres been plenty of fucking crying in baseball
1183122 my darling beautiful boy it is 10 months today since that heartless souless monster took you away from your family and friends
1183123 my resolve has not weakened i will not stop looking for you and bring that monster to justice it is only a matter of time even if it takes me my lifetime i will get justice for you
1183124 every night i look into the sky and i see your star shining brightly you were a bright star in our lives and will continue to be so forever
1183125 the monster may have taken you from me but it cant take my memories and my love for you away you will never be forgotten you are forever in our hearts
1183126 they say time heals its a lie it does not it just gets harder and harder not having you around
1183127 he was found by another worker and taken to hospital but died from his injuries seven days later
1183128 no fine imposed by this court will compensate for the familys loss but hopefully it will bring some closure
1183129 the bill risks conflating the roles of parliament and the judiciary which would be quite inappropriate
1183130 this is a recipe for confusion that arguably risks undermining the rights of fair trial for the individuals concerned
1183131 has a broken arm broken elbow and minor shoulder damage but is in good spirits he is having a little bit of surgery this afternoon or tomorrow to help correct the damage
1183132 he says hell be ok and is looking forward to a full recovery
1183133 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
1183134 in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction
1183135 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact
1183136 it is quite spectacular we are just wiping out primates
1183137 the problem with these species is that they have long lives so it takes time to reverse the decline it is quite depressing
1183138 this creates access allowing people to go to places that they could not go in the past
1183139 primates are relatively easy to hunt because they are diurnal live in groups and are noisy they are really easy targets
1183140 many of the asian primates like langurs are 5 10kg so they are a good target generally you find that what is big and easy to get disappears very quickly
1183141 if you kill seven 10 or 20 mountain gorillas it has a devastating impact on the entire population
1183142 within the red list criteria you are allowed to anticipate what will happen in the future as well as look at what has happened in the past
1183143 so it was decided not to change the mountain gorillas listing because of the sudden deaths and we do not know when it is going to stop
1183144 the lion tamarins were almost extinct in the wild but they were very popular in zoos so there was a large captive population
1183145 so zoos around the world decided to join forces to introduce a captive breeding programme to reintroduce the tamarins in brazil
1183146 they were not exposed to eagles or snakes and they did not know how to find food so a lot of them died but some did survive and slowly the numbers began to increase
1183147 it took time money and effort at all levels from the politicians to scientists and volunteers on the ground for just two species
1183148 he has that kind of response when he comes to the plate
1183149 and for all hes done in the game rightfully so
1183150 i know they dont want to walk me because they have to get to manny
1183151 thats the sign of a good hitter until you get that one that you can center cut you basically fight your way in an at bat and thats what hes doing
1183152 i dont think its the home run its the threat of hitting the home run
1183153 its going to put the opposing pitcher on notice that youre going to have to work hard to get through this
1183154 im the type of person that if you say to me that you cant do this then it makes me more determined anyway
1183155 but aside from what happened four years ago its just been one nightmare after another
1183156 when each one comes it hits you its like a punch in the stomach and you are down on the floor but fighting it does give you a bit of energy as well to have come this far gives you a boost and more confidence that things are going to go well
1183157 you can see a little bit out into the woods but i have totally knackered my ipod shuffle
1183158 i wouldnt be here if i didnt think i was in good enough shape i know from what i have done that i am good enough to be on the start line
1183159 everything has been on adapted treadmills there has been a bit of running outside i havent added it up but the volume has been more than normal because some of it has been cross training to put that endurance base there
1183160 probably the hardest thing is that i enjoy running its what i like doing and being stuck inside on a treadmill or on gym equipment doesnt give you the same enjoyment
1183161 but its given me some extra toughness in the closing stages of new york i was thinking about all the time i spent in the pool training and thats nothing compared to what ive done this time outside of running im racing unless my leg breaks down and i cant run thats it that has already been decided
1183162 the consistent point of contact was alan storey uk athletics endurance performance manager and i felt it was best to continue like that so that it did not become personal and emotional
1183163 the situation we have been thrown into is very unfortunate but i bear her no ill will whatsoever and wish her every success i hope she gets over the spider bite
1183164 on some level i understand kaman he has a connection with a grandparent being german
1183165 but with the young woman who has no such connection i just dont understand
1183166 shes a u s citizen you cant have one foot in the boat and one on the dock
1183167 but there were policies wrong ones where you had to own land to vote things like that
1183168 part of me understood that the ioc had to act and why
1183169 there was no greater thrill than putting on a u s uniform for the first time
1183170 we have a privilege and a responsibility that comes with our citizenship that responsibility is to accept the judgment of our government
1183171 where was gonzalez last year when cal football needed the heimlich maneuver
1183172 the only place where youll be able to see tiger playing is on tiger woods pga tour 09 so if you need your tiger fix buy the game
1183173 no i dont understand youre going to turn down six people even though we tell you its ok to sit at the small table
1183174 how much money would you be willing to spend to earn 2500 as an example
1183175 in your walkabouts check on the estate maintenance if mr low has done a good job give him credit for it if there are deficiencies point them out to the residents in short play the role of an effective opposition in hougang
1183176 eventually i believe we will win hougang back but whether we do or not i think we should serve the people thats what we are here for
1183177 ideally our political system should facilitate the emergence of a strong effective government after every election and a responsible constructive opposition
1183178 but no matter how you design it there is no guarantee because it depends on whether good honest and competent people come forward to stand for elections and the wisdom of the electorate when they cast their ballot
1183179 so theres a natural tendency which i can appreciate of some people wanting to have a voice not belonging to the party not belonging to the pap to check and balance the pap thats understandable because people want to debate issues they want to have their views expressed in parliament
1183180 in india the worlds largest democracy several criminals have been elected into parliament and some are serving jail terms including one convicted murderer who is waiting for his appeal to be heard
1183181 but recently they were brought out to vote because a confidence motion on the government was hanging in the balance they were of course then returned to jail but can you imagine mps with criminal records holding the future of singapore in their hands

1183186 the word for eight in chinese pinyin b sounds similar to the word which means prosper or wealth short for pinyin f in regional dialects the words for eight and fortune are also similar eg cantonese baat and faat
1183187 i am absolutely certain that generations from now we will be able to look back and tell our children that this was the moment when we began to provide care for the sick and good jobs to the jobless this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal this was the moment when we ended a war and secured our nation and restored our image as the last best hope on earth

1183213 i used poor technique on a weight that should have been easy
1183214 you hunch over just enough with that much weight on your back and i heard and felt a pop pop and a twinge down my leg i immediately started getting sharp pains into my leg
1183215 i felt like i was going to make the team
1183216 the most devastating time in my life up to that point
1183217 i realized that if you compared a child being diagnosed with autism to not making the olympic team all of a sudden that olympic thing doesnt seem so bad

1183238 sungguh mengherankan suatu kaum yang juga sebagai musafir menangisi musafir lain yang telah sampai pada tempat yang dituju
1183239 orang orang yang apabila malaikat maut mencabut nyawa mereka seraya memukul muka dan punggung mereka
1183240 orang orang yang dimatikan oleh para malaikat dalam keadaan berbuat zhalim terhadap diri mereka sendiri lalu mereka menyerahkan diri sambil berkata kami sekali kali tidak mengerjakan kejahatan malaikat mengatakan kamu melakukannya dan sesungguhnya allah maha mengetahui apa yang telah kamu kerjakan maka masukilah pintu pintu neraka jahannam dimana kamu kekal di dalamnya maka amat buruklah tempat kembali orang orang yang menyombongkan diri
1183241 sehingga apabila telah datang kematian kepada salah seorang dari mereka ia pun berkata ya rabbi kembalikanlah aku agar aku bisa berbuat amal shaleh sebagai ganti dari apa yang aku tinggalkan sekali kali tidak sesungguhnya itu adalah perkataan yang diucapkannya saja sedangkan di hadapan mereka ada dinding sampai hari ketika mereka dibangkitkan
1183242 tiada seorang pun diantara kalian kecuali akan diajak bicara secara langsung oleh allah pada hari kiamat tanpa ada penerjemah antara dirinya dengan nya
1183243 katakannlah wahai allah yang mempunyai kerajaan engkau berikan kerajaan kepada orang yang engkau kehendaki dan engkau cabut kerajaan dari orang yang engkau kehendaki engkau muliakan orang yang engkau kehendaki dna engkau hinakan orang yang engkau kehendaki di tangan engkaulah segala kebajikan sesungguhnya engkau maha kuasa atas segala sesuatu engkau masukkan malam ke dalam siang dan engkau mesukkan siang ke dalam malam engkau keluarkan yang hidup dari yang mati dan engkau keluarkan yang mati dari yang hidup dan engkau beri rezeki siapa yang engkau kehendaki tanpa hisab batas
1183244 inilah ciptaan allah maka perlihatkanlah olehmu kepadaku apa yang telah diciptakan oleh sembahan sembahan mu selain allah
1183245 atau siapakah dia yang memberi kamu rezeki jika allah menahan rezeki nya
1183246 berkata rasul rasul mereka apakah ada keragu raguan terhadap allah pencipta langit dan bumi
1183247 musa menjawab sesungguhnya kamu telah mengetahui bahwa tiada yang menurunkan mukjizat mukjizat itu kecuali rabb yang memelihara langit dan bumi sebagai bukti bukti yang nyata
1183248 ini kambing allah yang menciptakan dia pula yang menueunkan hujan dan menumbuhkan rumputnya lalu kalian menyembelihnya untuk selain nama allah
1183249 mengapa ia menjadikan ilah dzat yang diibadahi hanya satu saja sesungguhnya ini benar benar suatu hal yang mengherankan
1183250 dan sesungguhnya kami telah mengutus rasul pada tiap tiap umat untuk menyerukan sembahlah allah saja dan jauhilah taghut itu
1183251 dan aku tidak menciptakan jin dan manusia melainkan supaya mereka beribadah kepada ku
1183252 ketahuilah bahwa kefakiran seorang hamba kepada allah agar ia mengibadahi nya dan tidak menyekutui nya dengan apapun tidak ada percontohan dario kebutuhan tersebut sehingga ia dapat dikiaskan akan tetapi dapatlah diserupakan dalam beberapa segi dengan kebutuhan seseorang dengan makan dan minum sekalipun antara keduanya terdapat perbedaan yang besar karena hakikat seorang hamba adalah hati dan ruhnya dan ia tidak akan baik hidupnya kecuali dengan ilah nya yaitu allah yang tiada ilah yang berhak diibadahi kecuali allah maka tidak ada ketenangan di dunia kecuali berdzikir kepada nya ia berletih berpeluh dan akan bertemu dengan nya dan tidak ada kebaikan bagi dirinya kecuali harus bertemu dengan nya sekiranya seorang hamba memperoleh kelezatan dan kebahagiaan selain allah niscaya iatidak kekal karena ia akan berpindah pindah dari satu bentuk ke bentuk yang lain dari individu kepada individu yang lain dalam satu waktu ia bisa merasa nikmat dengannya akan tetapi pada waktu yang lain ia tidak akan merasakan nikmatnya bahkan kadang kadang menyusahkan dirinya akibat hubungannya dengan sesuatu tersebut atau keberasaan sesuatu tersebut di sisinya adapun ilah nya maka ia sangat membutuhkan nya pada setiap keadaan dan waktu
1183253 tidak ada sesuatu pun yang serupa dengan nya dan dialah ynag maha mendengar lagi maha melihat
1183254 tidaklah seseorang menyifati allah kecuali dengan apa yang disifati oleh nya untuk diri nya atau apa yang disifati rasul nya serta tidak boleh melanggar dna hadits
1183255 dan hamba ku masih saja mendekat kepad ku dengan ibadah ibadah nafilah sehingga aku mencintainya
1183256 mereka tidaklah diperintahkan agar beribadah kepada allah dengan memurnikan kepatuhan kepada nya dalam melaksanakan agama dengan lurus
1183257 katakanlah jika kau benar benar mencintai allah maka ikutilah aku niscaya allah akan mencintaimu dan mengampuni dosa dosamu
1183258 hanya kepada allah lah hendaknya kamu bertawakal jika kamu benar benar orang yang beriman
1183259 allah akan meninggikan orang orang yang beriman di antara kamu dan orang orang yang diberi ilmu beberapa tingkat
1183260 hendaklah kamu menerangkan isi kitab itu kepada manusia dan jangan sampai kamu menyembunyikannya
1183261 janganlah kamu mengharap harap bertemu musuh dan mohonlah kesehatan kepada allah namun jika kamu bertemu dengan mereka bersabarlah ketahuilah bahwa surga itu di bawah naungan pedang
1183262 siapa yang beriman kepada allah dan hari akhi hendaklah berkata baik atau memilih diam
1183263 katakanlah sesungguhnya rabbku mengharakan perbuatan keji yang tampak maupun yang tersembunyi
1183264 siapa yang mendatangi dukun atau tukang ramal lalu membenarkan kepada apa yang dikatakannya berarti dia telah kufur terhadap apa yang telah diturunkan kepada muhammad

1183278 they began to film with several guys then came all the disgusting things they would just put anything up me stalks of celery then it started with the coke bottles it became a big deal how i could get bigger bottles up me than anyone that had worked for them by this time i had been with name for about 3 years he was still supporting me but he was now beating me a lot and was spending most of his time with other girls i was getting completely broken and desperate i started using drugs about 2 years into being with him and now he is no longer asking me to do anything to make him proud now he would just withhold my drugs and tell me if i wanted them id have to do these things i needed that dope just to get through the day i was strung out pretty bad and i didnt care what they put up me and i didnt care how many of them took pictures of it i really didnt care about nothing the thing i guess that finally got me out of there is when he brought another woman hed been with and told me i had to do it with her for the pictures i dont know why that was worse than bottles or celery or maybe it was just all of it combined but anyway i had just had it so i took off i was just about 18
1183279 you have to understand my dad always called me his favorite son yknow he said he wanted to teach me to be tough so he would drop me off in places like sawtell yknow bad neighborhoods and let me find my own way home
1183280 i wandered into some courtyard a building with gates yknow and three i think three black guys basically passed me around i know there were two more mexicans standing watch by the gates then i think i blacked out anyway i was more afraid of what my father would do to me when i got home i had a broken nose and a bloody lip i fought so i knew hed know something
1183281 that was an easy one for the cops cause they knew who they were looking for someone holding his eye
1183282 i wasnt ready for anal sex it was painful but i can hide it really well
1183283 it was really hard because i really felt like a piece of meat in a lions cage 12 lions i had to do a lot of things i cant imagine anyone wanting to do
1183284 i daydream about nothing in particular to pass the time of 12 minutes
1183285 im thinking about how good i look in the mirrors and how good i feel in dance movements
1183286 i think about getting high and that i am making money to get high
1183287 i am giving these guys every chance to be decent so that i dont have to be afraid of them
1183288 i am filled with disdain for the customers who do not tip but sit and watch and direct you to do things for no money
1183289 i think of how cheap these fuckers are what bills i need to pay
1183290 i dont want him to touch me but i am afraid he will say something violent if i tell him no
1183291 i was thinking about doing prostitution because thats when customers would proposition me
1183292 i could only think about how bad these guys smell and try to hold my breath
1183293 i spent the dance hyper vigilant to avoiding their hands mouths and crotches
1183294 i was glad we were allowed to place towels on the guys laps so it wasnt so bad
1183295 correlation between porn and rape is greater than the correlation between smoking and lung cancer
1183296 well i dont like any of them id much rather be with you
1183297 i dont need studies and statistics to tell me that there is a relationship between pornography and real violence against women my body remembers
1183298 a mother and father in south oklahoma city forced their four daughters ages ten to seventeen to engage in family sex while pornographic pictures were being filmed
1183299 socially non discriminating as hysterically euphoric in response to just about any sexual or pseudosexual stimulation and as eager to accommodate seemingly any and every sexual request
1183300 well how was he supposed to know that she wouldnt like to have his fist stuffed inside of her
1183301 well thats just fine and dandy bb but what of the women who arent with men at all
1183302 but bb thats just a group of assholes i dont do any of that so im not adding to this problem

1183314 you should have known what would happen if you went up to his hotel room

1183327 women also denied you ec on that day therefore women are just as much to blame as men and the history of the world really has very little to do with it
1183328 this is heaven how big is my house now praise be to allah he has heard my prayers
1183329 so when you prayed to allah he gave you not the way you think he would give you he gave you even more by opening your inner eyes more than you had expected

1183340 china has gone through an industrialization in the past twenty years that many developing countries needed one hundred years to complete
1183341 scale and scope of pollution far outpaces what occurred in the united states and europe
1183342 the lack of coordination and poor delineation of public duties between pollution and protection of natural resources results in conflicts of interest between government bodies especially at the local level
1183343 elevation of the mep to the cabinet level is a promising step but this does not guarantee results
1183344 a perverse incentive for epbs to encourage the persistence of pollution problems
1183345 a remarkable achievement for a society whose access to information is often restricted
1183346 we meet at a moment when this country is facing a set of challenges greater than any weve seen in generations
1183347 our dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been thirty years in the making and was caused by the failure of politicians in washington to think long term about the future of the country

1183366 the reason this fine is so high is that sadly the company was warned about this matter there had been a similar incident some time before the problem had been identified and the problem wasnt fixed mr merritt said

1183368 i would just like to say at fosters we are shocked and saddened by this terrible tragedy mr stoneman said
1183369 our heart goes out to cuus family they have lost a husband they have lost a father and our workmates have lost a very respected member of abbotsford workforce

1183441 did you watch the news last night ten school children murdered three violent rapes six violent robberies with two clerks killed and three injured war in afghanistan iraq mongolia and so many places youd need a constant live feed to begin to keep up with who is pissed at who
1183442 its almost like no one cares enough to just say fuck this shit it just shouldnt be allowed murderers should be sent into the dark abyss by the same method they chose for their victims rapists raped and strangled wife or husband beaters beaten and traffic offenders crashed into why dont we believe in justice anymore
1183443 draaling i see youve arrived finally so you finally found me huh
1183444 and i come in the guise of a venerable china man to take you back i figured youd get the irony gleebly
1183445 can i ask if it is true that you put hitler on his path
1183446 michelle wants to be home when they get home from camp
1183447 weve always been the kind of people who go to the soccer games shop at target go for bike rides and make sure the girls get to the sleepovers theyve been invited to
1183448 we still do that but we usually have a lot of people watching now
1183449 my children force me to keep my feet on the ground
1183450 no matter what happens on any given day i am malia and sashas mom and i will struggle with that balance all of my life my first priority is to make sure the girls are ok how is school going how do they feel on any given day what activities do they have going that consumes me
1183451 the outreach is about acknowledging that we are all women you know what its like on the campaign trail i can be a lot more effective talking about issues that are relevant to me i feel guilty working and juggling my responsibilities as a parent if im still struggling with this there have to be other women who do too
1183452 the way i see it there are a lot of people like me like how i am about my husband my candidate they invested their hearts and souls into hillary clinton and many of them did this for years they have to figure out how they want to leverage their political power i understand that politics is a patience game you cant do this unless you have patience
1183453 i am a working class kid i wear so many different hats in my life the story i come out of is the story of most americans lives the stuff we talked about around the table is the same when you see your parents who dont have much getting out of bed and sucking it up every day you learn a lot about values
1183454 i need stability and evenness and not paying attention to media coverage helps its usually either really really good or really really bad which doesnt reflect what people are thinking
1183455 my first reaction to that was oh my goodness this is awful fortunately our girls are young enough where they dont read the new yorker
1183456 my view as a mom is there isnt a right moment for this kind of thing when it comes up is when we talk about it
1183457 when barack was first thinking about it a part of me was asking how hard will it be for me but the other part of me was asking how can i not support this man i could have held him back if i had asked him not to run absolutely he would not have done it
1183458 the michelle obama i was last year is the same michelle obama i am this year different circumstances same michelle
1183459 i told them dad had a big night and it appears hes going to be the democratic nominee for president
1183460 this is really a big deal theres never been an african american nominee for president do you guys realize the significance of this
1183461 well african americans used to be slaves and we couldnt vote and we didnt have many rights so of course this is a big deal
1183462 just like it would also be a really big deal if hillary clinton had won because there has never been a woman nominee for president and women used to not be able to vote and didnt have many rights either
1183463 like most mothers michelle obama relishes the daily mess of life as a parent
1183464 the michelle obama i was last year is the same michelle obama i am this year
1183465 michelle wants to be home when they get home from camp
1183466 the michelle obama i was last year is the same michelle obama i am this year
1183467 he managed to get away and ran home completely naked terrified and bleeding
1183468 oil and gas seepage from ocean floor reduced by oil production
1183469 the truth is that mccains campaign has received 1 33 million from individuals employed in the oil and gas industry not 2 million
1183470 we find the 2 million figure is based on a mistaken calculation
1183471 i think shes up for re election this year remember in 2002 she said she would not take part in fillibustering judges or maybe it was a certain hispanic nominee but as soon as she was re elected she went back to being a fillibustering leftist and who can forget her hideous behavior after katrina
1183472 may result in serious injury or death as well as damage to the crane and other property
1183473 no cranes have failed due to this issue and affected parts have been corrected or are in the process of being corrected
1183474 despite weak u s demand trends international unique visitors to its sites have ramped 25 percent 114 percent and 28 percent in april may and june versus last year in the second quarter
1183475 just because fish are there doesnt mean the platform constitutes habitat
1183476 thats like taking a picture of birds on a telephone wire and saying its essential habitat
1183477 if anyone wants to come up and count the fish well provide the first beer
1183478 but theyre going to have to bring the rest and theyre going to need a few cases because we have 11 years of research
1183479 if you remove a platform youll kill many millions of animals
1183480 just because fish are there doesnt mean the platform constitutes habitat
1183481 thats like taking a picture of birds on a telephone wire and saying its essential habitat
1183482 if only every jury in this country reacted to racism or bigotry the way this jury did we would have a much better jury system
1183483 stubborn rude stingy are thieves and have stolen other persons ideas
1183484 while the company is actively pursuing candidates to fill all positions and while there were several promotions that should suffice in the interim period at the end of the day the team that we knew and that we felt comfortable with running the business is gone
1183485 wilsons boyfriend anthony terry was arrested and pleaded guilty in march to charges of drug trafficking
1183486 i dont think this is an issue relevant to race
1183487 im sure we citizens would all face misdemeanor charges of negligent homicide if we shot an unarmed person
1183488 i am proud to have dan quayle at my side
1183489 i didnt know in 1969 that i would be in this room today
1183490 the enemy isnt conservatism the enemy isnt liberalism the enemy is bull
1183491 in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction
1183492 i have yet many things to say to you but you cannot bear them now
1183493 the most valuable thing is the trust of the people
1183494 by adding public affairs and photojournalism skills they can show the iraqi people what isof is doing to bring peace and stability to iraq
1183495 they were able to catch on very quickly and were creative with their stories
1183496 in the beginning some of the training was rough because this is a new subject to them but thats why we train
1183497 each day there was something new to learn about writing or photography
1183498 we were eager to take what we learned one day and carry it to the next
1183499 we are the connection between the army and the people of iraq
1183500 sometimes the people dont know what we are doing in the army
1183501 we can now tell the good things we are doing for the safety and security of our people we want iraq to be a safe place
1183502 even the best defense attorney couldnt save him because he was guilty as hell
1183503 frank was a crotchety difficult guy but very loving at the same time he didnt deserve this
1183504 look at the profession hes in hes got a lot of resources that he draws on so hell rely on those today im sure
1183505 to provide both the financial support and the volunteer efforts needed for the passage of proposition 8
1183506 running bmf on top of google app engine is a seemingly natural progression and quite arguably the easiest way to deploy boss so i spent today porting bmf to the gae platform
1183507 the bases are loaded and dusty baker wishes he was too
1183508 well she said that if you get any more of those youre going to look like a big turd
1183509 how i mounted goldie saved my partner lori and sniffed out the peoples justice
1183510 they are trying every conceivable thing and that is the right approach
1183511 but when the air is worst in beijing its the hardest to control
1183512 clouds and haze are not pollution this kind of weather is a natural phenomenon it has nothing to do with pollution
1183513 we dont approve of their use to pass judgment on the air quality you have to look at the complete monitoring system and analyze the data scientifically
1183514 if this is that same crappy osx clone from yesterday im burying the article and bitching about it
1183515 how many times do we have to remind people the dark theme was only for testing purposes in fact for default its been switched back to the light version
1183516 neon 6 hr 4 min ago 1 1 dugg for pure awesomeness
1183517 as rapidly as the technology changes todays consumers are looking for mobile products that feature the best of basic computing functions in an extremely compact and affordable form and lenovo designed the ideapad netbooks for that purpose
1183518 for apple it matters most that they patch the client libraries since there are so few osx recursive servers in use
1183519 the bottom line is that despite this update it appears that the client libraries still arent patched
1183520 what you saw in the congress this week was the war dance of the handmaidens of the oil companies
1183521 the economic damage caused by skyrocketing energy prices is a no brainer
1183522 i think the model poster for the democrat energy policy is a donkey pulling a beverly hillbillys truck jed is played by dingy harry granny is portrayed by nancy pelousey and jethro is portrayed by obama
1183523 as co ceos greg and sanjay will build on the significant changes and solid progress achieved at motorola and the mobile devices business under gregs leadership during the last seven months
1183524 i welcome the opportunity to lead this company into the future while working to create a successful independent mobile devices company that will continue to innovate and grow for years to come
1183525 the chains of habit are generally too small to be felt until they are too strong to be broken
1183526 i am excited to announce the launch of my new web site
1183527 i encourage everyone to go to www rahall house gov and discover the new and upgraded features weve included to make many of my offices services available to third district residents from the comfort of their own homes
1183528 i was elected as a delegate from the 1st district to go to the democratic convention
1183529 if anyone can turn this handset division around its sanjay jha
1183530 i think the engineering culture is a tremendous asset to motorola
1183531 right now personally i would have to give the edge to two sort in terms of the quality of the actual recycled materials
1183532 but people still have disagreements and they feel very strongly one way or the other
1183533 the easier you make it the more people will do it
1183534 i totally think that when im considering whether to walk that tin can to the street this would give me that little more incentive
1183535 the value of the commodities is better protected with the two streams
1183536 its easy for us but i have less confidence all of it is getting recycled
1183537 there is a culture of impunity and the conduct of minister mervyn silva is a challenge to the government in maintaining law and order
1183538 the cameraman was hospitalized with abdominal pains after they injured his testicles
1183539 it is important for industry to work in tandem with academia to unleash the immense power of parallel computing
1183540 were quickly moving the computing industry to a many core world
1183541 to kick start an industry wide effort to create and optimize software for the dozens hundreds and thousands of cores expected to power future computers
1183542 it feels a little strange a little awkward throwing the ball a little bit
1183543 but it feels good to get back out there when you throw the ball its not coming out like it used to so i have to get reacclimated to how i used to do things
1183544 obviously ben is so up on the no huddle and the terminology and its going to take kellen a little time to catch up on that especially the terminology
1183545 once the play begins he knows where to go and what to do but its that terminology part that will take some time
1183546 i want to show that ive become a better individual and will stop making selfish decisions which is what got me into this in the first place
1183547 i had to grow up as a student not just as an athlete
1183548 he brings maturity hes a hardworking guy and he carries a lot of respect in the locker room i think the experience hes had the last couple months playing pro baseball has to make you more competitive and a better athlete
1183549 its really soft like youd expect from a nice new field so what we really need is some rain
1183550 while patient volumes in the second quarter declined we believe the changes were due in part to short term issues that we have begun to address
1183551 and we minimized the impact upon earnings and cash flow through focused managerial discipline
1183552 i am particularly encouraged by the unambiguous progress we are making toward achieving our new vision to lead the industry in quality and satisfaction within two to three years we had a long way to go in a number of our markets when we launched the companys new direction on january 1 2008 but we have made sizable improvements to quality and patient satisfaction as we continue to improve in quality and patient satisfaction we expect to earn stronger patient and physician loyalty to our hospitals resulting in meaningful volume growth beginning within one to two years possibly sooner
1183553 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1183554 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1183555 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1183556 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1183557 barack obamas latest negative attack ad shows his celebrity is matched only by his hypocrisy
1183558 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy

1183560 strong environmental stand of the libs more lib oldsters are demanding drilling now that it is affecting their heating bills up north
1183561 the second quarter was a strong quarter for st mary year over year we grew production 15 from our retained properties commodity prices were very robust during the quarter which allowed us to generate strong cash flows for the year to date we have exceeded the production goals that we set out at the beginning of the year we are executing well on our business plan and our portfolio is improving every day i am pleased with how we are positioned as we enter the second half of the year
1183562 todays results continue to demonstrate the benefits of our portfolio transformation which concentrated our holdings in newer communities with higher rents and lower capital requirements
1183563 we have reinvested 850 million of the 1 7 billion sales proceeds into targeted markets total monthly income per home is approaching 1 200 and the average age of the portfolio is 15 years fifty percent of second quarter same store net operating income was generated from pacific coast communities which grew their net operating income by an average of 9 5 percent over last year
1183564 these communities strengthen our presence in west coast markets and are an excellent fit with our acquisition criteria which targets urban infill locations with strong job growth low single home affordability located close to public transportation
1183565 mesa verde villas is located between two existing udr communities pine brook village and villa venetia and we expect this acquisition to create value immediately through operating efficiencies in leasing staff maintenance staff and purchasing hearthstone at merrill creek is strategically located at the north end of seattles technology corridor in close proximity to major employers such as boeing trw aeronautical systems fluke corporation and campbells soup island square is a new mixed use community located on mercer island minutes from both downtown seattle and bellevue almaden lake village is adjacent to light rail with access to major employers including google yahoo ebay apple intel and adobe

1183567 die gespr che zur novellierung der trinkwasserverordnung laufen ob es einen grenzwert gibt und wo er liegt wird noch verhandelt
1183568 the second quarter has been a transformational quarter for hecla we acquired the remainder of the greens creek joint venture and sold our venezuelan interests both transactions had one time impacts on the second quarter financial results as we completed the transition related to these two assets in the long term the greens creek acquisition and the venezuelan disposition provide our shareholders with 100 of the world s lowest cost and fifth largest silver mine a substantially lower political risk profile and a 60 increase in 2008 annual silver production to 9 million ounces we have already seen a 60 increase in silver production for the second quarter compared to the same period a year ago
1183569 over the past 100 years hecla has materially changed itself before but this year s transformation is unique hecla now controls 100 of the two largest silver mines in the u s that will produce more than 35 of all u s silver production and has large exploration programs in the historic southern colorado creede mining district the historic silver valley idaho and the world class mexican silver belt we expect our mines strong cash flow to continue to fund growth in production margins and resources we ve added considerable mining and exploration expertise through our acquisition of the greens creek joint venture and we ve retained some talented people from our venezuelan interests so we are even better positioned to add value to both internal and newly acquired assets
1183570 the second half of the year will see an increase in production as a result of the acquisition of the remaining 70 3 of the greens creek joint venture and improvements in the production profile over the remainder of 2008 with the opening of the northwest west longhole stopes in june second half 2008 silver production is expected to be more than double hecla s share of the first six months production at greens creek variability in quarterly and even half yearly production happens periodically but will be more noticeable now that hecla owns 100 of the mine on the cost side we are impacted by increases that are affecting the whole industry but we can see dramatic containment of costs when we go to hydropower in the next few years
1183571 greens creek s underground exploration program is exciting because we expect it to continue to add to the resource base just as it has done over the past 20 years the surface program has defined new mine contact rocks to the northeast of the current workings this new area has the potential to host new ore zones which could result in a dramatic increase in resources in the future
1183572 these targets are what we expected when we combined more than 100 years of historical data with 3d computer exploration techniques it s now possible that these new target areas could be incorporated into next year s drilling program
1183573 it has been encouraging to receive widespread public support for this project in the creede area and the cooperation from the various regulatory agencies if the drilling is successful in this highly mineralized mining camp we could quickly add meaningful resources to our account
1183574 hecla has a history of carefully controlling dilution to shareholders i continue to believe that is an important factor in managing our business so we are considering all our options including deferral of capital expenditures to retire the bridge loan
1183575 a traditional art form has been greatly facilitated by the advent of the digital camera

1183580 when a person is in a high ceiling environment they are going to process information in a more abstract creative fashion
1183581 those in a room with relatively lower ceilings will process in a much more concrete detail oriented fashion
1183582 give me the venue and i will fill it up
1183583 higher ceilings prime the feeling of freedom that in turn facilitates the relational processing of multiple data
1183584 you can now drag an app icon across multiple pages in one motion rather than having to drag it drop it pick it up again and drag it over to next page and repeat
1183585 fears of insolvency have not as yet been fully set aside
1183586 there may be numbers of banks and other financial institutions that at the edge of defaulting will end up being bailed out by governments
1183587 at the root of the past decades unprecedented surge in world economic activity
1183588 the past decade has seen mounting global forces quietly displacing government control of economic affairs

1183591 property is a cyclical business and contraction will be inevitable as firms look to be more streamlined
1183592 markets like eastern europe russia ukraine turkey are still growing so it would be ludicrous to downsize european businesses anywhere near that figure
1183593 we have absolutely no plans for wholesale redundancies in the uk
1183594 there are a number of markets where property prices have risen very quickly
1183595 the issue is when the brits or the other foreign investors are no longer investing or even looking to sell and thats when prices can really go down
1183596 we have grown market share considerably in recent years partly due to organic growth and partly through acquisitions
1183597 these acquisitions were either to expand our geographic coverage or to strengthen existing business areas none were predicated on a continued capital markets boom
1183598 property services firms are all having to adapt to more difficult market conditions
1183599 the industry will have to manage costs accordingly because it is unlikely that the capital markets will recover in 2009 and likely that the leasing markets will continue to soften
1183600 our european business has expanded rapidly in the last five years but the quid pro quo was we couldnt grow as fast in the uk this gives us a chance to address that
1183601 the pullback in oil helped but when you strip away the backdrop were still faced with an anaemic economy and tepid profits and im not sure theres a real compelling story to jump on the equity bandwagon
1183602 the credit crunch continues to bite and even for some of the more successful financial institutions it continues to take its toll
1183603 the bond market is taking its cue partly from what is happening in equities and also there is just a general realization that this downturn in economic growth has spread to other countries
1183604 crude futures are down despite a brewing storm and that shows you how momentum has shifted in this market
1183605 and the upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations have increased
1183606 there is only one cure for inflation a slower rate of increase in the quantity of money it takes time measured in years not months for inflation to develop it takes time for inflation to be cured unpleasant side effects of the cure are unavoidable
1183607 there is only one cure for inflation a slower rate of increase in the quantity of money it takes time measured in years not months for inflation to develop it takes time for inflation to be cured unpleasant side effects of the cure are unavoidable
1183608 were hoping this puts everything poo related behind us so that we can focus on the real issue which is the fact that the democrats are part of a crappy system oppresses and coerces communities into a capitalist economy and undemocratic government
1183609 ok we admit it what were we thinking when we made mother taste so god damn awful turns out no one liked the taste of mother so weve hunted down the idiots that concocted the vile potion and processed them accordingly to ensure nothing like this ever happens again
1183610 its wrong of the islamic council to wait for the
1183611 im 100 percent certain that the fatwa council will not come out in favour something which conflicts with european law the council wasnt able to deal with the question of homosexuality this time but it thinks that subject is quite relevant and wants to look at the matter more
1183612 well my close friend who i cant identify who used to work at the state department told me all about it
1183613 the united states today and tomorrow must stay on the offense and weve got no greater asset than the united states military

1183624 i guess jerry yang didnt come out of the meeting as unscathed as it seemed
1183625 we were surprised at the very high vote counts that were pro jerry yang
1183626 certainly the final results seemed very different from the exit polls
1183627 the independent inspector of elections certified the results of the election and yahoo accurately announced those results
1183628 yahoo did not participate in the execution of the votes and was not a party to any errors which may have been made either by a voting institution or a proxy processing intermediary acting on behalf of banks brokers and institutions
1183629 capital research global investors asked broadridge financial to double check the votes it transmitted to yahoo on its behalf
1183630 i think jerry yang is still firmly in place until some deviation happens from the plan yahoo has set forth

1183646 a number of commercial firms compete with us using an open source business model by modifying and then distributing open source software to end users at nominal cost and earning revenue on complementary services and products
1183647 these firms do not bear the full costs of research and development for the software some of these firms may build upon microsoft ideas that we provide to them free or at low royalties in connection with our interoperability initiatives
1183648 to the extent open source software gains increasing market acceptance our sales revenue and operating margins may decline
1183649 there are no photos so take it with a grain of salt
1183650 larrabee is expected to kick start an industry wide effort to create and optimize software for the dozens hundreds and thousands of cores expected to power future computers

1183652 we are fed up with natos encroachment on our motherland we have had enough of ukrainian politicians who have forgotten their nation and only think about their own interests and we are fed up with the estonian governmental institutions which blatantly re write history and support fascism

1183659 there are groups in the past who have joined together in coalitions
1183660 we need to speak to our other groups in the asian american communities to see if theres an interest in starting a campaign against it

1183663 its always that fallback of the stereotype of the perpetual foreigner
1183664 theres still very much that image of them asian americans as foreign and still not belonging to this country
1183665 this is a highlight of why its important to have diverse people in decision making in companies and advertising
1183666 i think it speaks to the need for diversity in advertising and for some sort of interest in cultural sensitivity
1183667 unfortunately there are very many examples of these kinds of racist portrayals
1183668 i dont see this as stereotyping because it really doesnt conform to common stereotypes of asians
1183669 that said nobody wants to see his racial or ethnic characteristics turned into a cartoon nobody wants to be amos n andy

1183694 i do not believe that we should use this strategic oil reserves at this point i have said and in fact supported a congressional resolution that said that we should suspend putting more oil into the strategic oil reserve but the strategic oil reserve i think has to be reserved for a genuine emergency
1183695 we should sell 70 million barrels of oil from our strategic petroleum reserve for less expensive crude which in the past has lowered gas prices within two weeks

1183767 these tech savvy smart alecks have figured out that if you report a blog you dont like you can do some damage to a person
1183768 we believe this was caused by mass spam e mails mentioning the just say no deal network of blogs which in turn caused our system to classify the blog addresses mentioned in the e mails as spam
1183769 we have restored posting rights to the affected blogs and it is very important to us that blogger remain a tool for political debate and free expression
1183770 the last wave was this past week and now it got very quiet
1183771 malicious intentions at all its just that spammers can literally overrun a service if youre not careful so their defenses have become overzealous

1183776 google has consulted with us and that has been very positive but arguably the consultation could have gone wider

1183778 telstra is taking advantage of a narrow window of opportunity before new laws come into existence under which an independent umpire can order employers to negotiate in good faith with worker representatives
1183779 this is the same strategy telstra pursued earlier this year when it knew awas were about to be banned and using morally dubious tactics made a final push to sign 15 000 workers on to individual contracts

1183783 the strategic oil reserve exists for americas national security strategy not barack obamas election strategy
1183784 the last release of oil from the strategic reserve came in response to hurricane katrina but the only crisis that has developed since barack obama last rejected this idea 28 days ago is a slide in his poll numbers
1183785 i am not interested in making the perfect the enemy of the good
1183786 particularly since there is so much good in this compromise that would actually reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1183787 the reason this fine is so high is that sadly the company was warned about this matter there had been a similar incident some time before the problem had been identified and the problem wasnt fixed
1183788 this problem was known and it wasnt fixed until a man died that is what makes this case so serious
1183789 i would just like to say at fosters we are shocked and saddened by this terrible tragedy
1183790 our heart goes out to cuus family they have lost a husband they have lost a father and our workmates have lost a very respected member of abbotsford workforce
1183791 from the point of view of the government department the department of justice it saves us some time and money as well because were not dealing with more than 100 foi application a year
1183792 you can actually get on the map you can see where they are so its giving the public a lot more information
1183793 for apple it matters most that they patch the client libraries since there are so few osx recursive servers in use
1183794 the bottom line is that despite this update it appears that the client libraries still arent patched
1183795 a number of commercial firms compete with us using an open source business model by modifying and then distributing open source software to end users at nominal cost and earning revenue on complementary services and products
1183796 these firms do not bear the full costs of research and development for the software some of these firms may build upon microsoft ideas that we provide to them free or at low royalties in connection with our interoperability initiatives
1183797 to the extent open source software gains increasing market acceptance our sales revenue and operating margins may decline
1183798 questions of sequestration forests how we deal with our sequestration particularly in terms of coal fired power stations theyre important issues to discuss and work through but in the meantime we really want to get on with it
1183799 by delivering frankly a really comprehensive program which includes renewable energy targets a billion dollars i announced in the budget in terms of energy efficiency measures in the household were starting to get on the road to actually deal with climate change
1183800 weve laid out through the green paper a process of discussion about these issues and this is another report which contributes to that process

1183803 larrabee is expected to kick start an industry wide effort to create and optimize software for the dozens hundreds and thousands of cores expected to power future computers
1183804 over time the consistency of intel architecture and thus developer freedom afforded by the larrabee architecture will bring about massive innovation in many areas and market segments
1183805 as rapidly as the technology changes todays consumers are looking for mobile products that feature the best of basic computing functions in an extremely compact and affordable form and lenovo designed the ideapad netbooks for that purpose
1183806 the problem had been identified and the problem wasnt fixed and thats what added to the severity of this particular incident
1183807 in the medium and the longer term they are well chosen deliberate buybacks which will provide once we get some water into the system the type of relief the river does need
1183808 theres no water there for farmers theres no water there for irrigators theres very little water there for the buybacks
1183809 were committed to making sure that we do start to get some water into the river system to help the environment but the fact is that particularly with some of these licences at this point in time theres a shortage of water
1183810 all they did was buy the cheapest water they could to make it look like theyve got the 35 gigalitres theyre aiming for which cant be delivered
1183811 over 40 per cent of what they bought this year was in the lachlan river or north and it never flows into the murray river system except once every 50 years
1183812 down the bottom in the murrumbidgee and the murray the water they bought was general security and there is no general security for irrigators at the moment
1183813 the incident itself is a call and a cry for help and i hope and expect that the premier through to the vast majority of the tasmanian community will all be extending their wishes for a fast and speedy recovery
1183814 when you bring together the best in the business and everybody gets in shape you can be the best in the business and dominate
1183815 im going to try to live up to that responsibility
1183816 but at the same time were one as a unit its going to be the d line not just one individual person
1183817 with the absence of sedrick it really helped some other players develop
1183818 im not used to working this hard but at the same time its good for me

1183821 thats an awful lot of carbon we do not want emitted into the atmosphere professor mackay said
1183822 we need to look at forests through fresh eyes prof mackay said
1183823 the policy can no longer be blind to the green carbon thats in these natural forests he said
1183824 we need to start factoring in the carbon value of these forests when deciding what to do with them
1183825 what we really hope is to get is to get a lot of these young people to come down and then want to stay in new orleans and practice medicine here
1183826 one of my close family friends is a fire chief back in chicago so he was here helping out during katrina and he sort of couldnt understand why i want to come here and with the heat and humidity its a lot different here than chicago but i said for a great education its worth it
1183827 why be a part of something thats established when you can be part of a great story here
1183828 every year we see an increasing need for more and more physicians and its great to see so many people from out of state want to come and rebuild the city
1183829 just to help out they saw the city coming back and they just want to be a part of it
1183830 the teleclass will cover the basics of getting started as a real estate virtual assistant scheduled topics include
1183831 over us 20 a barrel drop that should have translated into a much greater drop in the price of petrol at the bowsers
1183832 i found this amusing they were saying biggest drop theyd seen in four years
1183833 it should have been more theyre patting themselves on the back but theyre still ripping motorists off
1183834 i think were going to see petrol prices continue to go down
1183835 i think well go down to the lower 100s and that should see us with petrol prices back into the a1 20 per litre
1183836 but at the moment were still a few cents over what we should be
1183837 it was assumed petrol prices would impact on the tourism industry but nobody expected the traditional australian family holiday to have changed so much
1183838 we want to see a new campaign promoting destinations on the far south coast far north coast act and western nsw
1183839 there are also recommendations made against the director of surgery dr almehdi who is currently overseas
1183840 the third person involved that will require further investigation by queensland health and or the medical board was the former executive director of medical services dr margetts
1183841 that was the big gap that occurred in his transference from victoria to queensland in the first place
1183842 that the college of surgeons although that they knew there were concerns about khalifallas performance didnt pass that information on in a timely way
1183843 we certainly are very willing to sit down with queensland health and consider how this could potentially be used
1183844 but we would see it as a relatively blunt instrument and it certainly shouldnt be a substitute for sophisticated error reporting systems
1183845 it would be far better to have excellent clinical audit systems that do not rely on subjective impressions
1183846 particularly when you may well have a small hospital with only one doctor wheres the other doctor to dob them in wheres the other doctor who has the expertise perhaps to judge your area of competency
1183847 la tolerancia es el n ctar de los abusadores como humanos todos somos diferentes pero hay principios universales 0 respeto a los chavistas los comunistas y los izquierdosos extremos nunca han tra do nada bueno al mundo y nunca lo traer n
1183848 the human soul longs for things higher warmer and purer than those offered by todays mass living habits by tv stupor and by intolerable music
1183849 these can save someones life so its not a laughing matter
1183850 i went on to explain i did not feel clients understood the term
1183851 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
1183852 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
1183853 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
1183854 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
1183855 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
1183856 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
1183857 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
1183858 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
1183859 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
1183860 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
1183861 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
1183862 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
1183863 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
1183864 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
1183865 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
1183866 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
1183867 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
1183868 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
1183869 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
1183870 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
1183871 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
1183872 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
1183873 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
1183874 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
1183875 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
1183876 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
1183877 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
1183878 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
1183879 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
1183880 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
1183881 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
1183882 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
1183883 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
1183884 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
1183885 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
1183886 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
1183887 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
1183888 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
1183889 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
1183890 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
1183891 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
1183892 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
1183893 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
1183894 who are open to doing something on the production side
1183895 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
1183896 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
1183897 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
1183898 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
1183899 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
1183900 i am so angry that there was a station right there and it was shut
1183901 it was very distressing for his family seeing someone they adore lying on the floor being sick and looking so ill even my three year old boy was there
1183902 we needed professional help it was just too long a bit quicker with specialist help and he would have had half a chance
1183903 although there were no community first responders booked on duty in the area at the time staff in the emergency operations centre rang a number of the responders but were unfortunately unable to raise any
1183904 considered you sic objections but do not feel it have sic breached our codes on the basis you suggest
1183905 it seems unthinkable but for the first time in history ice is on course to disappear entirely from the north pole this year
1183906 recoil in such a light rifle can only be described as brutal
1183907 they need to pop a cap in that phat ass mf
1183908 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
1183909 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
1183910 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
1183911 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
1183912 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
1183913 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
1183914 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
1183915 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
1183916 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
1183917 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
1183918 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
1183919 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
1183920 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
1183921 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
1183922 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
1183923 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
1183924 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
1183925 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
1183926 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
1183927 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
1183928 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
1183929 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
1183930 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
1183931 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
1183932 our goal is to get the iphone client out as quickly as possible because it does represent a significant percentage of the devices touching our network

1183934 its a big one its someones livelihood i think hes had enough chances and to go down this track it just takes it over the edge so i would think maybe yes
1183935 i think just the protectionism that eddies trying to give his club to save the image in fact is detrimental to the very thing youre trying to build and thats the culture
1183936 he mcguire loves the club hes got passion for the club but this has been behind the scenes and theyve always said they can handle it
1183937 well its four times in the last two years that this has happened they arent handling it well at all
1183938 next year that didak comes up oh no well change that now we think its detrimental to the team and you shouldnt impact the players
1183939 well its like i said you make your bed you lie in it
1183940 you will get some people that we cant be with them every minute of the day while theyre making their decisions and all we can do is we can give them the support prior and we can make them accountable afterwards and they have to deal with the consequences

1183966 researchers discovered that high concentrations of ascorbate had anticancer effects in 75 percent of cancer cell lines tested while sparing normal cells
1183967 the researchers traced ascorbates anti cancer effect to the formation of hydrogen peroxide in the extracellular fluid surrounding the tumors normal cells were unaffected
1183968 when you eat foods containing more than 200 milligrams of vitamin c a day for example two oranges and a serving of broccoli your body prevents blood levels of ascorbate from exceeding a narrow range
1183969 injected ascorbate into the veins or abdominal cavities of rodents with aggressive brain ovarian and pancreatic tumors
1183970 up to four grams per kilogram of body weight daily
1183971 the researchers discovered that high concentrations of ascorbate had anticancer effects in 75 percent of cancer cell lines tested while sparing normal cells
1183972 in immune deficient mice with rapidly spreading ovarian pancreatic and brain tumors the ascorbate injections reduced tumor growth and weight by 41 to 53 percent

1183974 this is a call to action to call for male circumcision its been two years and still there is not enough money focus to scale up effort and more needs to be done
1183975 there is no national male circumcision campaign to promote it more education is needed
1183976 we found that there was no difference between the circumcised men and uncircumcised men that there is no increase in sexual dysfunction in circumcised men and in fact circumcised men did report greater penile sensitivity after circumcision

1184042 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
1184043 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
1184044 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
1184045 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
1184046 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
1184047 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
1184048 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
1184049 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
1184050 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
1184051 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

1184059 through my virtual law firm operation i have used an indian firm to do legal analysis for clients that im working with and the results have been excellent and it costs about 50 percent less than the cost of a u s paralegal since the person doing the work is an attorney trained in english common law the quality of the work is often better weve also assigned basic legal research as in compiling statutory materials on a particular subject for every jurisdiction this work has been excellent and our cost is about 12 an hour and that cost includes the cost of online legal research services this cost is less than it would cost to have the work done by a u s law student and the work is more reliable

1184091 we will make you comfortable under white crystal clear grapes
1184092 im more like a kid with diabetes in a fucking candy store
1184093 the object of this decision is to drive the democratic process
1184094 its like theyve dug out the meaty parts of our brains and slapped them on some linen
1184095 the tom fuentes sic led majority seems well positioned to deliver another victory this year
1184096 she even gave me a specific day to come i dont know why but i doubt its a surprise visit from her son so dont get excited and so ill be delivering it this week

1184100 oh god i am not ready for nino s solo
1184101 hip hop hibi to the hip hip hop and ya dont stop
1184102 we are moving to a global village and yet we dont have our global elders the elders can be a group who have the trust of the world who can speak freely be fiercely independent and respond fast and flexibly in conflict situations
1184103 despite all the ghastliness that is around human beings are made for goodness the ones who ought to be held in high regard are not the ones who are militarily powerful nor even economically prosperous they are the ones who have a commitment to try and make the world a better place we the elders will endeavor to support those people and do our best for humanity
1184104 do patents inhibit or promote health care access and innovation
1184105 aint got no dope all i gots my 40 aint got nobody baby that i can call my shorty
1184106 the mccain camp seems to have turned lemons into lemonade
1184107 huge crowds and mostly favorable press reviews of obamas overseas trip have been trumped by mccains attacks on obama loss of support for obama among young voters may also be due to his perceived reversals on issues they care about such as the war and government eavesdropping
1184108 politicians use the truth to spread lies writers use lies to spread the truth
1184109 they say this cat giraffe is a bad mother shut yo mouth but im talkin bout giraffe then we can dig it
1184110 is there anything he could have done to make himself less popular
1184111 it makes me feel better about myself to belittle others
1184112 my light can only shine brighter if i blow out everyone elses candle
1184113 cosmopolitian identity is elitist and representative of a mobile middle class cultural tourists dabbling rootlessly in a variety of cultures in a relentless search for new experiences aesthetic stimulation and cultural novelty and unable to sustain a sense of local connection or responsibility for the growing number of socially and cultural excluded
1184114 stephanie says that she wants to know what country shall i say im calling from across the world
1184115 jetzt raus ihr wir haben gleich sperrstunde und wir wollen keinen rger mit der polizei
1184116 dem gegen ber steht eine autonome nutzung des kaufhauskomplexes d
1184117 this is just a fun way for me to say hey boys im still here
1184118 the people who bought the homes say well we love looking into your yard and seeing the horses and the cattle but we dont like the flies and we dont like the mosquitoes and when i cut my field to bale it they say we dont like the dust in the air
1184119 i respect that theyre here and spent a lot on their homes but on the other hand give me a little bit too ive been here since i was 7 years old
1184120 his batman rasps his lines in a voice thats deeper and hammier than ever
1184121 delivers his lines in a hoarse voice with an unvarying inflection
1184122 sounded absurdly deep like a 10 year old putting on an adult voice to make prank phone calls this time bale affects an eerie rasp somewhat akin to brenda vaccaro doing a miles davis impression
1184123 will wii owners be forced to buy a wii motionplus for each controller they own to play newer games
1184124 there will be games that will be enhanced by the wii motion plus as well as games that can only be played with it users will need four if they have four controllers but were going to try to offer it for as little as possible we havent announced the price yet but the cost of making the wii motion plus is not that much so i think we can make it very affordable
1184125 i backed up a little bit and watched the show
1184126 pretty much a local idiot just trying to go fishing
1184127 every choice could mean the difference between life and death
1184128 the major outpouring of donations outside of texas came from oil giant hess whose executives and family members from new york and new jersey gave 285 000 within a week of mccains texas swing with ten donors all maxing out to the rnc with identical 28 500 donations
1184129 if youre going to make it you have to have political connections
1184130 i dont care how much they damage the country including me and my family just as long as those damn democrats arent in charge
1184131 it will be a cold day in hell before i sleep with you
1184132 currently drug trafficking a criminal and socioeconomic phenomenon of enormous complexity is the biggest threat to national security
1184133 sometimes you end up sitting half your day waiting for the roads to clear its irrational its unjust
1184134 i dont think theres another city like this in the world
1184135 were offering you a good salary food and medical care for your families
1184136 the state of tamaulipas mexico the united states and the world territory of the gulf cartel
1184137 the cartels are very good at this theyve had songs written about them they put up these signs they make themselves out to be robin hoods
1184138 people like this we mexicans like a good joke we like to make fun of our problems
1184139 cubans are now allowed to purchase mobile phones and dvd players and computers
1184140 now that the cuban people can be trusted with mobile phones
1184141 they should also be trusted to speak freely in public now that the cuban people will be allowed to have toasters in two years they should stop needing to worry about whether they will have bread today
1184142 if ra l is serious about his so called reforms
1184143 he will allow these phones to reach the cuban people
1184144 these are no more than training exercises for certain situations but i want to stress that we are not showing people how to use these methods
1184145 in the past torture was usually hidden now they dont even bother
1184146 i like my job i like my work i like it here in iowa
1184147 they dont go after employers they dont put ceos in jail
1184148 is like a natural disaster only this one is manmade
1184149 in the end it is the greater population that will suffer and the workforce that will be held accountable
1184150 until we enforce our immigration laws equally against both employers and employees who break the law we will continue to have a problem
1184151 can we really execute a search warrant without taking any action against illegal employment that we know is taking place
1184152 or will just taking business records through a search warrant cause illegal aliens to leave and then were not fulfilling that part of the mission as well
1184153 it is a question of mexico asserting itself as a partner and not as a supplicant
1184154 we have to throw the old forms of conditioned collaboration in the garbage as well as the taboos of the past that have impeded the two countries from having a common strategy to fight their common problems
1184155 even as we fight the epidemic globally we must focus at home and i intend to do so with my foundation
1184156 i have been extremely disappointed with the clinton foundation especially with it headquartered in harlem of all places that it has been silent on this issue
1184157 im very grateful and it is appropriate that president clinton is committed to taking this on
1184158 this is the inheritance of my grandfather this is our company and were not going to let them take it away from us
1184159 i do not believe that people are realizing how many benefits nafta has brought both to the united states and to mexico
1184160 we want to find ways to frankly convince the american people that this is an arrangement thats worked for us and its also worked for our neighbors
1184161 the government of canada sincerely apologizes and asks the forgiveness of the aboriginal peoples of this country for failing them so profoundly
1184162 the treatment of children in indian residential schools is a sad chapter in our history
1184163 let us not be lulled into believing that when the sun rises tomorrow the pain and scars will be gone they wont but a new day has dawned
1184164 the government of canada built an educational system in which very young children were often forcibly removed from their homes often taken far from their communities
1184165 many were inadequately fed clothed and housed all were deprived of the care and nurturing of their parents grandparents and communities
1184166 languages and cultural practices were prohibited in these schools tragically some of these children died while attending residential schools and others never returned home
1184167 the memory of residential schools cuts like merciless knives at our souls
1184168 we were separated from parents and families i was one of the people who suffered physical abuse as well as sexual abuse sadly i am not unique
1184169 in some schools 50 to 60 percent of the children died but they kept bringing kids the more kids brought to the school the more money was given to run the schools deaths went unreported many were buried in unmarked graves many children ran away and died because of drowning or freezing
1184170 i want to get rid of the indian problem our objective is to continue until there is not a single indian in canada that has not been absorbed into the body politic
1184171 the federal government condemned the traditions beliefs and customs of native peoples and endeavored to assimilate them by such policies as the redistribution of land and the forcible removal of native children from their families to faraway boarding schools
1184172 were in a slowdown we grew in the fourth quarter of last year we havent seen first quarter growth statistics yet but theres no question were in a slowdown and yeah people are concerned about it
1184173 now is not the time to renegotiate nafta or walk away from nafta
1184174 i worry if the united states in the end refuses this agreement with colombia
1184175 we have important allies in colombia colombia is fighting against political violence against the revolutionary armed forces of colombia they fight against drug traffickers and i think that a rejection of or turning our backs to such an ally as colombia could create long term problems for our countries in south america
1184176 its extremely important i think to bear in mind that when you provide more opportunities for trade in the latin american region there will be many more opportunities for prosperity
1184177 it seems like president bush is living on another planet if he thinks our economy isnt in a recession
1184178 on the day you eat of it you shall most surely die
1184179 no you will not die god know in fact that on the day you it it your eyes will be opened and you will be like gods knowing good and evil
1184180 he said he wanted to find out if it was as easy in real life to rob a taxi as it was in the game
1184181 are sending out requests to outlets and shops to pull the games off their shelves
1184182 where do kids get some of the things they say from
1184183 we call it the forked tongue express around here hell lie about anything
1184184 i feel badly that with a lot of these people barry goldwater would be unwelcome
1184185 i would hope for arizonas future in the republican party is that it would continue to produce leaders of the caliber of goldwater of sandra day oconnor of john mccain yet if this posture continues from the state party you wont see those leaders come from within the party anymore because no one in their right mind would deal with these people
1184186 we should have a good debate that uses accurate information not false misleading and discredited information especially on something as important as whether or not we will achieve quality affordable health care for everyone
1184187 senator clinton has in her campaign at least has constantly sent out negative attacks on us e mail robo calls prerecorded telephone messages fliers television ads radio calls and we havent whined about it because i understand thats the nature of this campaign
1184188 maybe we should ask barack if hes comfortable and needs a pillow
1184189 we have one tenth of the troops and we do more fighting than you do
1184190 i dont think he expected an express commitment that day that they would draw down in iraq and buttress in afghanistan
1184191 but he certainly registered canadian interest and that of the allies involved
1184192 my personal perception is that it was not used well unfortunately we have a lot of corruption in our country
1184193 the attitude should not be one of seeking political gain
1184194 but there was not proper accounting at the state level it was like a blank check
1184195 at the state level we have corruption and impunity and it keeps growing
1184196 there are two dangers here and both of them are part of the already manifested popular fear
1184197 one is that the inquiries are not made and nothing is done and two is that there are so many factors of institutional and personal failure that it is overwhelming and nothing is done
1184198 a claim that something is inaccurate is being vetted more quickly and moving into the media more quickly
1184199 we have more pakistani illegals coming across our border than all other nationalities except those immediately south of the border
1184200 you are not going to hear me making up stuff about my biography
1184201 i dont go around saying i was a lifelong golfer because i once rode in a golf cart when i was 8 years old
1184202 i would not say that the level of honesty or deception is better or worse than in past campaigns
1184203 it is a function of running for office that you want to say things that are pleasing to voters
1184204 to fact check at a much more granular level than ever before
1184205 there are places outside the city that dont even have running water and down there in the center theyve got this fancy block of frozen ice
1184206 this is something for the people they complain about how much this costs but mexico spends way more than this to take care of the corrupt ones the oligarchs the so called influential ones
1184207 these are some of the toughest conditions ive ever worked under
1184208 youve got the altitude its more than 3 000 feet above sea level so theres less oxygen which we need to make ice and then weve got that hot sun
1184209 theyve been after me to bring them here for days
1184210 this rink is all they show on tv i have no idea what to expect
1184211 we are withdrawing massive areas from industrial development to protect some of the most impressive ecological and cultural wonders in the north for generations to come
1184212 this area is the one our ancestors chose for us to live in this will preserve it for generations to come
1184213 the government is actually delivering on their promises and delivering much more quickly than we are used to
1184214 the whole scale of the boreal landscape is staggering for an american
1184215 we have a lot of what we consider vast landscapes in the west but nothing like the boreal you really have to fly over it it just goes on and on
1184216 isnt just canada this is a global resource and a worldwide treasure
1184217 many years later as he faced the firing squad col aureliano buend a was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice
1184218 many alfas later in front of a 44 squad col aureliano buend a had a 60 about that distant afternoon when his father 26 him to 62 ice
1184219 theyre almost at the bottom when it comes to prestige
1184220 i worry a great deal about the alliance evolving into a two tiered alliance in which you have some allies willing to fight and die to protect peoples security and others who are not
1184221 it puts a cloud over the future of the alliance if this is to endure and perhaps get even worse
1184222 i cant amass them to where i might have a decisive point obviously i cant move as quickly as i want to
1184223 there is a hell of a lot of debate back in various countries about what their role should be
1184224 work opportunities here are nonexistent so this is going to cause more migration to the united states even though it is getting harder to find work over there
1184225 this is demonstrating that there is an increased dependence on remittances and a great vulnerability for the country
1184226 neither the government nor the families who are affected have a good alternative to remittances
1184227 we consider this a great conquest in the fight to clarify what happened during that time
1184228 the bush administration is violating the law and that is why were here today
1184229 these species do not have an indefinite time to be saved time is running out for the polar bear and time has run out for this decision
1184230 so this is not an unprecedented occurrence nor is it unique to the bush administration
1184231 to achieve global warming policy that special interest groups cannot otherwise achieve through the legislative process
1184232 we are not in the same situation as the u s a
1184233 american households can be 100 percent in debt with floating interest rates it is not the case in france unemployment in the u s a is increasing in france it is decreasing the u s economic growth has slowed french growth is continuing up
1184234 the crisis took its first steps in the u s
1184235 the u s is coping with it and its their responsibility
1184236 this may not be the silver bullet that kills off the threat of recession but its a move in the right direction
1184237 if another soldier called me up thinking of coming to canada id tell him to think twice
1184238 before you know it youre just firing away and its reflexive
1184239 its time to grow up and recognize that if were serious about this threat weve got to take reasonable measured but nevertheless determined steps to getting better security
1184240 frankly has as much credibility on telling people to grow up as geoffrey the giraffe
1184241 with concerns about a recession on the way the timing for clamping down on billions of dollars in trade and travel could not be worse i can think of nothing that would push the northern border states over the edge more surely than this heavy handed ill timed and misguided government mandate
1184242 does he believe in our country im a little leery of that
1184243 how can you be president if you dont say the pledge of allegiance
1184244 the long standing cliche that ohio is representative of everything is just that a cliche
1184245 were representative of one part of the american political and economic system but not of the nation as a whole
1184246 shes got more on the ball obamas too cool too slick too charismatic
1184247 shes got contacts around the world and bill would be a good asset in the white house though hes a double edged sword
1184248 i dont think its clear in peoples minds where he stands or what happened in this situation
1184249 it hurt him in ohio and unless its cleared up its going to affect him in pennsylvania as well
1184250 every candidate has come through and said if we were president none of this would have happened
1184251 innocent people dont belong in a so called criminal database
1184252 will provide an additional form of biometric identification from persons who would normally be fingerprinted
1184253 we know for a fact that the proposed regulations will save the lives of many innocent people and will prevent devastating crimes
1184254 these regulations are long overdue we should have done this 10 years ago
1184255 were really struggling here in ohio the economy the cost of gas
1184256 hillary asked me to call you because its all up to you
1184257 i like the clintons when he left office we were ahead with money now were in a big hole
1184258 i just feel like i can trust her more i never heard of obama my boyfriend said he gave a speech at the last convention but i dont remember that
1184259 whats so exciting here is that we have cells from real people their dna rather than samples of their work or technologies
1184260 and we have them on the oregon landscape 1 000 years before what used to be the earliest samples of human remains in the americas
1184261 i dont think we know for sure whether these are dog coprolites or human
1184262 we know that native americans have used these sites for centuries and so their dna could have gotten into the older dog feces through urination
1184263 dried up like that it maintains its shape and is very different from the surrounding soil
1184264 its so screwed up its sad talk about snatching defeat from the jaws of victory
1184265 anytime you have a bottleneck a certain amount of genes are lost
1184266 it aint the wolves theyre good at being wolves its overzealous enforcement by the agency
1184267 what the right answer is whats the best approach to take is not universally agreed to
1184268 in the middle of the night you wake up in a cold sweat when you hear your dogs barking wondering if somethings wrong
1184269 ah kertas lagi tak bisakah kita ganti tempat menulis itu dengan sesuatu yang tidak terbuat dari kayu harusnya kita bisa mencari sumber lain yang lebih ramah lingkungan bukan
1184270 coret coret terus itung sana itung sini bodo amat sama kertas bodo amat sama duniaaa
1184271 kalau memang kamu berani hayo kita berkelahi di dalam lubang kelinci yang kalah akan jadi santapan yang menang dan saya yakin saya akan menang
1184272 kerjasama kita sukses hari ini kita makan kenyang dan saya tidak perlu berlari mengejar kencang

1184279 the tao doesnt take sides it gives birth to both good and evil the master doesnt take sides she welcomes both saints and sinners the tao is like a bellows it is empty yet infinitely capable the more you use it the more it produces the more you talk of it the less you understand hold on to the center
1184280 listen to your customer change your product to meet the customers needs or change your market
1184281 entrepreneurs spend too much time creating their product and not enough time selling it they must change the product to meet the demands and needs of the customer if the customer doesnt like it it doesnt matter what you think of it they wont buy it
1184282 keep an open mind and recognize the opportunity provided by the relationship by working hard to understand chrysler and working closely in a give and take relationship we saw needs well ahead of our competition
1184283 we began combining elements that led to higher efficiency within chrysler we saw the need for automation and delivered the first automated plant of the 80s
1184284 here is how we did it we sent three people into the assembly line to study their process what happened to our product when it went in we noticed we could reduce cost on packaging we could provide a lighter product and better quality was the result we were perceived as going beyond the scope of the vendor just by listening
1184285 whats your strategy what resources and assets are critical for future profit and growth
1184286 your personal view will always be distorted when looking at this magnificent organization you have put together through brilliant unparalleled genius
1184287 you have to measure the right things but measuring delivers a ton of data you must be careful to make sure it is relevant and worth the effort otherwise it can be overwhelming and a waste of time
1184288 the business environment is always changing and leading indicators are the only way to make sure you know whats coming
1184289 as oxford grew we expanded we focused on technology and expanded too quickly we were so determined to satisfy the customer we did not watch the rest of the processes we werent paying enough attention to the financials and we outran our cash
1184290 it was the best way to isolate what caused problems by knowing exactly what is happening within any one system the alternative is frustrating guess work
1184291 changed the consciousness of millions of people forcing them to think about past and present in a different way
1184292 the oso was subordinate only to the minister of internal affairs to stalin and to satan
1184293 hey where have you guys been you ask you havent blogged in forever
1184294 i am excited to help welcome mark back to the kings organization
1184295 during his time in chicago as an assistant coach mark did a great job working with their young players and their young defensemen in particular and he was instrumental in helping that club make the great strides it has made the last couple of years
1184296 i am also excited about the promotions for jamie and nelson in the time i have spent with jamie i have come to admire his work ethic his passion and the knowledge he possesses at the same time nelson and bill were professional players and very good players and their knowledge of our club will be invaluable to me and our entire staff as we move forward
1184297 saya tahu amal amal saya yang kecil itu mungkin juga tidak benar saya jalankan saya tidak mungkin selamat pada hari akhirat tanpa syafaat kanjeng nabi muhammad setiap kali saya mengambil selembar daun saya ucapkan satu salawat kepada rasulullah kelak jika saya mati saya ingin kanjeng nabi menjemput saya biarlah semua daun itu bersaksi bahwa saya membacakan salawat kepadanya
1184298 i find that for me personally jewish understand ings of g d and
1184299 the more cash you have at your disposal and the faster it moves through your organization the greater your financial momentum
1184300 weve got the formula for success lets push it up another notch
1184301 we learned a valuable lesson we were expanding rapidly and focused on technology and satisfying the customer but not paying attention to the financial guy we out ran our cash
1184302 early on put a financial system in that provides key information
1184303 in addition to securing a strong financial partner most of our marketing success is driven by word of mouth referrals not only is it more effective but significantly less costly too
1184304 people who in their dna embrace a participatory accountable collaborative self starting autonomous workplace where change communication and enthusiasm are required
1184305 no mousetrap competes well with our level of service because of our people we compete successfully against free
1184306 customizing our product and future products is the key to our growth that starts with the basics of answering the phone and listening our people are good listeners they are creative and dedicated to finding the best solution for us to compete and grow we have to do something different
1184307 we thought we had an advantage working in a community fairfield iowa with people deep in sales telecom and computer backgrounds we were right and we were wrong we did know good people but we didnt originally understand how important the qualities of flexibility openness communication and teamwork were to the profitable growth of our company outside the box sounds romantic but some people arent comfortable except in a clearly defined box
1184308 in some respects it has been tough for our company i give everyone a clear description of how much autonomy and authority they have to make decisions that extends as far as they need to make a decision with a customer or prospect on the phone we dont bring anyone into the company we cant trust with this responsibility oddly enough many people are not equipped to take on this responsibility
1184309 we measure it with every discussion and while we are patient with people in embracing this openness eventually we insist
1184310 it is a question we are mulling over in great detail right now its a core value to our company and its success i could see us changing our financial principles for a short term goal more than i could the principles regarding our people the wrong people could kill our brand we may change a lot of things but the core principles of open communication finding mature and flexible people who are motivated by playing a key role in the future of the company who want to play with other adults who want to be treated like an adult who want to accomplish something and be recognized for it that part will never change
1184311 getting out of the way my job is to 1 organize procedures to ensure minimal interruptions 2 provide the resources equipment direction incentives and mandates including authority and autonomy to inspire the best from the people and 3 ensure smooth communication to and among everyone in the company
1184312 i get in the way when a policy needs to be established or changed i get in the way when change has to come i get in the way when our people are unable to do their jobs with present resources
1184313 khao phra viharn is a crumbling buddhist temple of 11th century angkorean vintage and hindu architectural inspiration it is but one of many such structures to be found in northwest cambodia and northeast thailand their histories and civilization stretch back as far as the 9th century a little before europe began moving from its dark ages to its middle age during the civil war which ensued after the vietnamese invasion of cambodia on christmas day 1978 preah vihar as it is known to cambodians served as a remarkably well placed communications centre for the tripartite guerrilla coalition battling the army of prime minister hun sen in phnom penh in the late 1990s khmer rouge forces furiously fought off hun sen troops at the foot of the cliff only relatively recently has the area has been cleared from mines and made safe for tourism the temples location is one of fifteen or so contentious sites along the modern border between thailand and cambodia much of the confusion dates back to maps drawn up in the early 1900s by french colonial officials in 1962 the international court of justice in den haag ruled that the temple belonged to cambodia even though it was and remains almost impossible to reach without passing through modern thailand

1184331 bij elke doop zal een bordje verboden te visen worden geplaatst in de rietkraag en het wordt een jaarlijks terugkerend ritueel dat elke getuige verplicht is in zijn leven te ondernemen tenzij de gezondheid daarvoor ontbreekt

1184345 when a pr issue was before us he was the one who very thoughtfully and very carefully analyzed the issue and came up with a carefully orchestrated response
1184346 he would always do his homework on an issue with class and dignity he epitomized what a pr executive could be
1184347 he loved this area and this community and he saw growth in so many areas during this lifetime that he was a part of

1184349 the long term trend is prices remaining constant or going down
1184350 law enforcement agencies claiming successes in this anti drug battle is somewhat illusory
1184351 a robust counterdrug relationship between the united states and mexico
1184352 unfortunately this information is not adequately compiled analyzed and disseminated throughout the intelligence and law enforcement communities
1184353 ground breaking technology and time tested tactics such as the use of k 9 units

1184359 canada must move quickly and make immediate strategic investments in its arctic
1184360 the huge irony is that we are only talking about this because humanity has burned so much oil and gas that the ice is melting
1184361 it could be a vicious cycle climate change is opening up the arctic to oil and gas drilling which almost certainly will cause more climate change
1184362 climate change policy is northern policy and we have no time to waste
1184363 i immediately realized the gunner was shooting at the canadian position

1184369 it is obvious that mafias are taking steps to assure that the situation doesnt change so that they can continue enriching themselves under the protection of corruption
1184370 in the fight against corruption we will not give in to the pressures and dark forces that try to discredit the actions were taking to comply with the law
1184371 we are aware that mexicans are insisting on police who are honest clean and trustworthy
1184372 the regional federal police chiefs who take office today do so with the understanding that the police are there to serve the community not to serve themselves

1184401 i also saw myself in that video if you look closer i am holding the hand of the person you refer to as my friend i dont even know him i never saw that guy before we were just enjoying the moment of not only the possibility for making history but for the first time since i have been engaged in the voting process i have never been and felt this excited about any other candidate black or white
1184402 making fun of the american people who feel right now that all we have left is hope because faith is the substance of things to hope for and the evidence of things not seen we have enough evidence that what we have seen in sen barack so far gives us hope that he does have what it takes to become the next president of the united states of america

1184410 nu am fost niciodat antistelist cand steaua era in umbra eu participam la toate antrenamentele lor cresterea mea profesionala m a adus in conflict in concurenta sportiva cu steaua fiind echipa armatei steaua trebuia sa castige si eu m am opus la asta daca nu ma opuneam steaua nu ajunge aunde ajungea fiindca in sport important e cine e al doilea deoarece il pune in evidenta pe primul important e pe cine bati iar in perioada aceea eu trebuia sa accept sa fiu batut
1184411 venirea lui boloni la steaua mi s a datorat in proportie de 80 cand eram antrenorul echipei nationale jucatorii faceau ce le ceream eu am ajutat foarte mult steaua fiindca era o echipa de vitejisti si venirea lui boloni a adus calmul necesar si le a organizat jocul

1184416 i must be the worlds best lunch lady giving you a pink pearl eraser
1184417 this is the best eraser everybody needs veggies and everybody needs a good eraser
1184418 you all look like you could be those peoples children
1184419 first and foremost its close to the uw campus close to the madison area technical college campus its a vibrant edgy neighborhood
1184420 we wanted something that didnt require a lot of extensive new building
1184421 something that we could almost just move into so that we could accommodate what we expect is an explosion of demand for small start up space not exclusively but probably primarily for student originated companies
1184422 when you drive up and down east washington avenue its like a ghost town
1184423 i think we need all the new blood that we can get in this part of town
1184424 getting some of those buildings filled making the boulevard a little bit more attractive and having some new jobs is certainly going to be an advantage
1184425 its like the rebirth of an old industrial corridor into its new use for the future
1184426 but its kind of a pastoral setting its a different kind of setting which is very attractive to a lot of businesses but there are some businesses that are more attracted to the real urban setting
1184427 you have to see the big chunks of wetlands tearing away and floating away
1184428 theyre only floating because the dam or series of dams at tenney park back the water up into the yahara river these wetlands that were growing on peat and instead of being inundated and lost immediately floated up ever since that happened theyve been steadily eroding away
1184429 i dread going out to look after it pops up two to two and a half feet above what its supposed to be because i know what im going to see
1184430 between the wind action and the ice action things will get whittled away so its kind of like a slow death
1184431 it accelerates as it gets wider and the waves get bigger
1184432 ultimately were losing habitat that does support a wide variety of birds and other wildlife
1184433 anything we can do to lower the summertime levels will enhance the growth of the plants
1184434 and it will also reduce the loss when we have flood events because if you start at a lower elevation you have more storage so it wont rise up as high
1184435 any silt that we can catch up in this part of the watershed as opposed to having it travel freely to lake mendota has certainly got to have some sort of positive impact on the ultimate water quality
1184436 if the high water levels of the lake are eroding and increasing the width of the upper yahara river channel by 7 feet a year thats tens of acres of high quality marshland lost every year
1184437 youve got lakeshore property owners who arent pleased about flooding or damage to their shorelines and having to rip out piers before their float away
1184438 youve got boaters whove been denied a lot of recreation because of no wake orders
1184439 this could be a real historic opportunity to really have the kind of discussion that maybe wasnt occurring in the past
1184440 the details are being worked out with the doctors this week but the tentative plan is for radiation and chemotherapy
1184441 journalistic work for an indefinite but god willing not too lengthy period
1184442 autumnal nothing to do with leaves it is to do with a certain brownness at the edges of the day brown is creeping up on us take my word for it russets and tangerine shades of old gold flushing the very outside edge of the senses deep shining ochres burnt umber and parchments of baked earth reflecting on itself and through itself filtering the light at such times perhaps coincidentally the leaves might fall somewhere
1184443 the lovely warm feeling of satisfaction resulting from enthusiastic reviews
1184444 it has dramatically changed the way we run our lives
1184445 until recently universities and professional societies have ducked out of this because they dont want to be lightning rods for extremists
1184446 far fewer incidents of harassment have been directed at our faculty
1184447 perpetrators must be stopped using whatever means necessary and the use of force is a morally righteous tactic furthermore it is the most likely tactic to be effective in halting these atrocities
1184448 with a broad brush it makes everyone who cares about animals look like an extremist and that plays into the hands of people who exploit them they are able to discredit what we do

1184477 expressing your sexuality and enjoying a relationship is something everyone values

1184482 more and more people are really thinking about the environment in ways they hadnt before
1184483 the vendors are paying a tremendous amount of attention to this
1184484 the industry has made great strides and certainly there are companies that take design for the environment to heart
1184485 youd be shocked at how much equipment you have turned on thats redundant
1184486 in a lot of enterprises theres no one person responsible and thats where the trouble begins
1184487 the secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources
1184488 true compassion is more than throwing a coin to a beggar it demands of our humanity that if we live in a society that produces beggars we are morally commanded to restructure that society
1184489 jeez you didnt respond the way i was expecting you to you actually responded like you know
1184490 and ever since then ive been asking myself over and over
1184491 we are keen to see common sense and common courtesy prevail and do not understand how lothian buses reaches the conclusion that the dda requires a total ban on prams being taken on the bus
1184492 i dont think anyone in a wheelchair wants people thrown off buses for them it should be left up to the drivers discretion
1184493 i am worried this is being framed as a wheelchair users versus mothers battle and it is not like that
1184494 the public service vehicle accessibility regulations 2000 psvar requires new full size buses to be wheelchair accessible this means that there needs to be a designated wheelchair
1184495 it is acceptable for this space to be used by other passengers when it is not required by a wheelchair user but it should be vacated if at all possible when a wheelchair user requires it
1184496 come to me all you are weary and heavily burdened and i will give you rest
1184497 i think lets see you need to go its i have a feeling
1184498 do you actually know or are you burnt out from writing your soc paper
1184499 the integration of people thats number one and were talking about the integration of the arts as in music dance and theater and how you integrate the arts together to produce something thats of value
1184500 you have people in wheelchairs who have no mental disability theyre just physically disabled
1184501 and you have people with autism who may look perfectly normal to other people
1184502 with every rehearsal something happens something changes changes can come out really nicely because they come so naturally
1184503 it served its purpose of that first glimpse at what integration is about and awareness youre using the art form to teach awareness thats why the education part is so important
1184504 by revoking my jerusalem id they have revoked all the rights i have in palestine as well as my sons
1184505 there is an ongoing and widely documented policy of discrimination in planning and building land expropriation home demolition the whole issue of revoking residency
1184506 we believe in a jewish majority in jerusalem as such it is the capital of the jewish nation
1184507 the israelis tried to take jerusalem out of the political game by using all their power to change the situation and consolidate their rule over the city but they failed
1184508 she was born there i dont see why she should change it
1184509 just because we came under occupation does not mean they israelis have the right to expel people
1184510 the presidency would like to place it on record that president mbeki has never at any stage received any amount of money from man ferrostaal
1184511 the sunday times or anyone who has evidence that the president or anyone else received bribe s in the procurement process should as we have emphasised before approach the law enforcement agencies
1184512 no evidence was found of any improper or unlawful conduct by the government
1184513 the irregularities and improprieties referred to in our report point to the conduct of certain officials of the government departments involved and cannot in our view be attributed to the president or the ministers involved in their capacity as members of the ministers committee or cabinet
1184514 five of those appointed were already in parliament while one was not
1184515 with previous efforts focused on networking or user level applications the gaping need to process and respond to large amounts of data has been inadequately addressed
1184516 our effort will go deep into the system software stack to explore new and better ways to provide system level support for data intensive computing
1184517 the challenge for the computing research community is to find a way to turn massive data into knowledge
1184518 the potential impact in fields as diverse as medicine biology physics meteorology and even the social sciences like economics are virtually limitless
1184519 more and more people are really thinking about the environment in ways they hadnt before
1184520 the vendors are paying a tremendous amount of attention to this
1184521 the industry has made great strides and certainly there are companies that take design for the environment to heart
1184522 youd be shocked at how much equipment you have turned on thats redundant
1184523 in a lot of enterprises theres no one person responsible and thats where the trouble begins
1184524 as the national army we shall show loyalty and be subordinate to the sitting commander in chief and i can assure you that updf is very professional and shall give support to anybody ugandans decide to be their president come 2011
1184525 i will salute that commander in chief ugandans shall choose i will pledge my loyalty and support to him
1184526 the constitution is clear power belongs to the people once the people decide on what they want for us in updf we shall respect the peoples decision
1184527 i dont believe him anyway but if he is genuine with what he says it is indeed a good development because we know aronda is a cadre of the movement
1184528 it is unfortunate that president museveni has made all his former body guards army commanders and these are people who owe all their loyalty to him
1184529 although updf should serve anybody it may not be possible because all recent election petitions have proved that the army is involved in electoral violence
1184530 there is no ugandan who can believe what gen aronda is saying because his mentor president museveni was riding on the same axiom of professionalising the army but it is still the same army of 1996 2001 and 2006
1184531 i shaved it as soon as i came out of the game
1184532 we were losing when they hit that grand slam and then we came back and won
1184533 in about a week it will be back it goes hand and hand with winning
1184534 i would have kept it if we were winning that game
1184535 well see tomorrow its one of those things where i probably played with it the whole first half im just trying to find a way to beat it its probably just better to rest it its sore its strained every time i take a step it feels like its about to pull hopefully it will it get better soon
1184536 who knows about tomorrow its day to day its a lot better today and hopefully it will be a lot better tomorrow
1184537 we thought about it but i prefer to leave it alone
1184538 where hes arrived at as a professional right now its in his and our best interest to leave it alone
1184539 well talk with him again tomorrow about where its at
1184540 there were probably days when i didnt know if i was going to be able to make it back or not
1184541 it was really difficult both physically and psychologically emotionally its been a difficult period of time and im not back yet so i dont want to get ahead of myself im really looking forward to this on a lot of different levels
1184542 i dont feel anything well see how i feel tomorrow but hopefully its good
1184543 weve used him as a starter in long relief and just for an inning hes throwing strikes
1184544 he said ill get better thats what you want in a player
1184545 the next start wed be talking about 80 and the one after that about 95
1184546 well see what they look like when they get to 80 or 95 pitches and they could be back before september
1184547 now been shut down by the department of buildings but club lawyer ken fisher says the club has fixed whatever led to the failed inspection
1184548 louis armstrong is quite simply the most important person in american music he is to 20th century music i did not say jazz what einstein is to physics and the wright brothers are to travel
1184549 what he does is real and true and honest and simple and even noble every time this man puts his trumpet to his lips even if only to practice three notes he does it with his whole soul
1184550 if you have to ask what jazz is youll never know
1184551 i think that louis armstrong loosened the world helped people be able to say yeah
1184552 my whole life my whole soul my whole spirit is to blow that horn

1184691 however i did want an opportunity to promote the 2 atime project i am a part of our aim is to provide computers to underprivileged kids in my neighborhood and i thought the festival would be a great place to kick things off many people tried to convince the event organizer wes jackson to give me the opportunity to do 2 songs and to say few words about the computer program but wes refused every request from the door i want to say that i respect his right to refuse my participation no problem however the reason he gave to people for brushing me off was bullshit the real reason wes didnt want me there is cause i called him out on his bullshit the first year he had the event in the williamsburg brooklyn steps away from where i was raised long story short i got pissed cause there werent any non white locals represented on stage or in the audience no one that grew up in my projects on the southside or on greenpoint knew about the event it was clear from the beginning that we uncool black and latin people in the neighborhood were not welcome its ironic they didnt want us there because a few of the older people that live in that neighborhood actually built the space where the festival was held and theyre grandkids helped clean up the thrash after people left festival some those older dudes from around the south side believe that this deliberate slight happened cause im latino i can kind of see why they think that but i dont believe the decision to snub me was based on race i dont think wes jackson is a racist however the snub does speak to something just as hurtful to me cultural snobbery and class ism

1184809 messenger data gives us a unique opportunity to study distances in the social network
1184810 to our knowledge this is the first time a planetary scale social network has been available to validate the well known 6 degrees of separation finding

1184829 its always crowded this bay and beach 116th where the teenage girl drowned this summer are the busiest bays in rockaway the public parking lot is across the street the lifeguard shack public bathrooms concession stand are here but on most days in the scariest summer in years i have just two lifeguards this is beyond bureaucratic incompetence this is dangerous bordering on criminal
1184830 because i dared to tell the truth about how dangerous the lifeguard situation is in rockaway in the pages of the daily news
1184831 this is how my bosses get even the six bays janet fash oversees from beach 96th to beach 102nd sts get two lifeguards per chair my bosses will tell you they staff the beaches by state guidelines of one lifeguard for every 50 yards thats cya time because an addendum to the state guideline says that when theres a higher bather load bigger crowd we will provide more lifeguards but they dont period so what are they waiting for a lawsuit for me to have a drowning
1184832 they are playing with public safety in a summer when the waters of rockaway are more dangerous than theyve been for years
1184833 weve already had one drowning and august is always the worst month for drownings because of the storms
1184834 fund raisers are often a barrier for people to get involved

1184849 the other problem in rockaway is a lot of people who dont have health care plans use the emergency room as their doctors
1184850 when you come in with an emergency or a serious case you are competing with all of the people who have things that are not necessarily an emergency
1184851 the thing that disappoints me is that the hospitals are not willing to put the patients needs in front of who is in charge
1184852 we need the hospitals to merge so they can be more efficient
1184853 bravo ganga singh long live you for making such a wonderful thing

1184871 that was probably about 94 that we stopped using salt tablets
1184872 some people just mis took them more was not necessarily better
1184873 the water in the body was attracted to the stomach to dilute the salt so the fluids were not getting into the outer part of the body
1184874 if they is a public sale it might be so limited
1184875 its just going through the clearinghouse and all the things youve got to go through

1184883 i could have gone these days had they not given me a day off i would have been out there like everybody else
1184884 wade has done this over the years i think it really has shown not just on the practice field but even on game day that everybodys a little bit livelier
1184885 its just like racing horses you cant run them every day and expect them go out there on race day and perform at their best
1184886 the same with cars you run them to a certain point then you put them in the shop and go through the diagnostics thats what im going through right now
1184887 it wasnt like i was looking for a day off im just doing what the coaches are telling me to do

1184892 the same with cars you run them to a certain point then you put them in the shop and go through the diagnostics thats what im going through right now
1184893 as much as the historic districts in the bronx are beautiful there are a lot of buildings that need help
1184894 we do one building and then we might be able to get the next and as a result the whole neighborhood suddenly realizes what the historic buildings look like
1184895 our objective is to change the perception that the bronx particularly our area is a burned down dilapidated crime ridden area
1184896 our objective is to have people understand families live there its beautiful its in transition but its nice and it has some wonderful buildings
1184897 esse mundo de fadistas de faias parecia a carlos merecer um estudo um romance isso levou logo a falar se do
1184898 the only thing the kids have to bring is their own sneakers
1184899 what is it that young people need the most discipline and this sport provides it
1184900 you see a lot of kids on the corner and i refuse to let that happen to her
1184901 at the same time youre being competitive you can have fun it keeps you going
1184902 once you see the pier it gets hard because it looks so close but really youre only halfway there
1184903 at least i didnt get stung by any jellyfish this year
1184904 my swim buddy encouraged me to keep going and i did
1184905 it teaches them they can accomplish almost anything with hard work and determination
1184906 were delighted to have dance back for a fifth season next year fox is very lucky to have televisions preeminent performance competitions in american idol and so you think you can dance and its no coincidence that creator and executive producer simon fuller and executive producer and judge nigel lythgoe have been a part of both these successes
1184907 although i wasnt in any real danger from the incident i didnt want to wait for a serious accident to happen for me to contact the council to explore the various possibilities that may minimise the potential danger at the intersection
1184908 i know that council is not responsible for the location of red light cameras but they might be able to put the pressure on the rta to have a look at it
1184909 it is more prevalent at night time when there is less traffic on the road a lot of trucks just get a head of steam up down the hill and just make a decision to go through the lights
1184910 i just think it is a matter of time before someone collects someone else
1184911 the way the pumps work is you turn the tap which energises the system and the water keeps flowing until you turn your tap off
1184912 so if for any reason the delivery of the water is compromised such as a broken tap or a leak in the pipe the pump continues to pump and people end up losing a lot of their stored water
1184913 if you ask 10 farmers if this has happened to them there would be seven or eight who would say it had
1184914 i know of someone whose pump ran overnight for about six or seven hours because of a toilet that kept running
1184915 as well as losing a good deal of the tank water the pump ended up burning out so when he woke up the next day he couldnt have a shower a cup of tea or flush the toilet
1184916 it provides a continual flow of water for up to 15 minutes from when the tap is turned on and then stops pumping
1184917 domestic uses of water are completed in that time unless people take long showers
1184918 and even then the setting can be changed to up to 30 minutes
1184919 so if there is a problem in the system there wont be the usual loss of water
1184920 of research done on this it the device could save around 180 million litres of stored water per year
1184921 we want to say a big thank you to all our customers for their best wishes and their cards letters and gifts
1184922 but it was so lovely that people were so appreciative and kind
1184923 weve made friends out of our customers so we were very sorry we had to say goodbye
1184924 we have been touched by all the gifts we have received the bakery made the most beautiful cake to say thank you on our last day we had chocolates and cards one of the customers even wrote a letter
1184925 nib have been very good to us we just wanted to say a big thank you to all our customers
1184926 weve seen customers through their bad times and their good times watched families grow up and then start having their own children and developed so many friendships
1184927 i think its harder for marlene because she has been here singleton office the whole time and i dont think i knew the customers like she does but ill miss the face to face contact and that personal chat
1184928 the present cityrail service to newcastle and sydney operates at inconvenient times and has a very limited service
1184929 after the train that leaves singleton at 10 43am there isnt another train until 7 30pm
1184930 nine hours is far too great a gap between services
1184931 there is already a lot of traffic on the roads going to and from newcastle and this is only going to increase with more people coming to live here
1184932 this as well as rising petrol prices means there is a need for increased rail services
1184933 i cant take the bus because i have too much equipment to carry and i havent caught a train for college in months because it doesnt fit with my course times
1184934 i know a lot of younger people who would use the trains if they ran more regularly
1184935 the cultural exchange is a chance for takahata students to put what they have learnt in japan into place here
1184936 it is extremely exciting it is the first time in a long time that singleton high has competed and the win has certainly created a real buzz among the students
1184937 they were brilliant singleton high was the first school on stage and the students just exploded on the stage they couldnt have performed any better
1184938 anyone in the community is welcome to come along and support us
1184939 there are a lot of people in town who are living in their cars or sleeping in parks
1184940 you only have to walk around at night with you eyes open to see that there is a problem
1184941 people dont know what it is like to be homeless to feel like you have failed your kids as a parent because you cant provide for them
1184942 it is a serious problem and an issue the government needs to address
1184943 it is a national disgrace that we have had 17 years of economic growth and there are still so many people that are homeless
1184944 i dont think anyone was not alarmed at the lack of youth refuges or hostels in the upper hunter
1184945 however it is a very complex issue it is not just about providing affordable accommodation it is about ensuring that people dont become homeless in the first place
1184946 im downwind of every pecan tree and oak tree between my house and the methodist church
1184947 in the wintertime i could fill up an 18 wheeler with leaves

1184949 some people who burn know exactly what they are doing
1184950 but some other ones are negligent i would hate to see somebody lose their home because people arent paying attention
1184951 it is just a drop in the bucket compared to the total project cost but any help is appreciated
1184952 it has always been the u s 17 associations position that money raised for transportation should be spent for transportation
1184953 trying to send a message to this guy who wont listen to reason that if he doesnt stop hurting animals more drastic measures will be taken its certainly not an initial tactic but a tactic of last resort

1184987 wahai ummu salamah ia diberi kebebasan memilih mana di antara suaminya yang paling baik akhlaknya ia berkata
1184988 wahai rasulullah apakah ia mempunyai kekuatan untuk menggauli mereka semua
1184989 yaa ayyathuna nafsul muthma innah irji i ila rabbiki raadhiatan mardhiyyah fadkhulii fi ibadi wadkhuli jannati
1184990 ya rabb kami sesungguhnya barangsiapa yang engkau masukkan ke dalam neraka maka sungguh engkau hinakan dia dan tidak ada bagi orang orang yang zalim seorang penolongpun
1184991 dan peliharalah dirimu dari api neraka yang disediakan untuk orang orang kafir
1184992 hai orang orang yang beriman peliharalah dirimu dan keluargamu dari api neraka yang bahan bakarnya adalah manusia dan batu
1184993 aku akan memasukkannya ke dalam neraka saqar tahukah kamu apa neraka saqar itu saqar itu tidak meninggalkan dan tidak membiarkan neraka saqar adalah pembakar kulit manusia di atasnya ada sembilan belas malaikat penjaga
1184994 dan tiada kami jadikan penjaga neraka itu melainkan dari malaikat dan tidaklah kami menjadikan bilangan mereka itu kecuali sebagai ujian bagi orang orang kafir
1184995 api kamu ini hanyalah satu bagian dari tujuhpuluh bagian api di neraka jahannam
1184996 dan sesungguhnya jahannam itu benar benar tempat yang telah diancamkan kepada mereka pengikut pengikut syaitan semuanya jahannam itu mempunyai tujuh pintu tiap tiap pintu telah ditetapkan untuk golongan yang tertentu dari mereka
1184997 dan orang orang yang kafir kepada ayat ayat kami mereka itu adalah golongan kiri
1184998 orang orang kafir dihalau ke neraka jahannam berombong rombongan sehingga apabila mereka sampai ke neraka itu dibukakanlah pintu pintunya dan berkatalah
1184999 apakah belum pernah datang kepada kalian rasul rasul di antaramu yang membacakan kepadamu ayat ayat rabbmu dan memperingatkanmu akan pertemuan
1185000 masukilah pintu pintu neraka jahanam itu sedang kamu kekal di dalamnya
1185001 adapun orang orang yang kafir dan mendustakan ayat ayat kami mereka itu penghuni neraka mereka kekal di dalamnya
1185002 dan orang orang yang mendustakan ayat ayat kami serta menyombongkan diri terhadapnya mereka itulah penghuni penghuni neraka mereka kekal di dalamnya
1185003 tidakkah mereka orang orang munafik itu mengetahui bahwasanya barangsiapa menentang allah dan rasul nya maka sesungguhnya neraka jahannamlah baginya mereka kekal di dalamnya itu adalah kehinaan yang besar
1185004 sesungguhnya penghuni neraka yang paling ringan siksaannya ialah orang yang diberi sepasang sandal yang talinya terbuat dari api neraka lalu mendidihlah otaknya karena panasnya yang laksana air panas mendidih di dalam periuk dia mengira tiada seorangpun yang menerima siksaan lebih dahsyat dari itu padahal dialah orang yang mendapat siksaan paling ringan
1185005 wahai manusia sekalian menangislah jika tidak dapat menangis maka paksakan dirimu untuk menangis karena sesungguhnya ahli neraka itu akan terus menangis hingga air matanya mengalir di pipi masing masing seperti air yang mengalir di sungai sampai air mata itu habis dan matanya pun pecah pecah seandainya ada perahu yang diletakkan di situ niscaya berlayarlah ia
1185006 diberi minum dengan air yang berasal dari sumber yang sangat panas mereka tiada memperoleh makanan selain pohon yang berduri yang tidak menggemukkan dan tidak pula menghilangkan lapar
1185007 sesungguhnya pohon zaqqum itu makanan orang yang banyak berdosa ia seperti kotoran minyak yang mendidih di dalam perut seperti mendidihnya air yang sangat panas
1185008 dan tiada pula makanan sedikitpun baginya kecuali dari darah dan nanah
1185009 ditimpakan atas penghuni neraka kelaparan seberat azab yang sedang mereka alami
1185010 makar akan dibuatkan untuk orang orang kafir itu pakaian pakaian dari api neraka
1185011 pakaian mereka adalah pelangkin ter dan muka mereka ditutup oleh api neraka
1185012 the figure is likely to go up because we keep getting calls from residents and municipalities about washed out roads
1185013 hai orang orang yang beriman diwajibkan atas kamu berpuasa sebagaimana telah diwajibkan kepada orang orang sebelum kamu agar kamu menjadi orang yang bertakwa
1185014 hai orang orang yang beriman peliharalah dirimu dan keluargamu dari api neraka yang bahan bakarnya adalah manusia dan bebatuan penjaganya malaikat malaikat yang kasar dan keras mereka tidak mendurhakai allah dan selalu mengerjakan apa yang diperintahkan nya
1185015 maka barangsiapa yang telah dijauhkan dari neraka dan dimasukkan ke dalam surga maka sungguh ia telah sukses
1185016 wahai rasulullah sesungguhnya aku telah mengajak ibuku untuk masuk islam tapi ia menolak ajakanku dan menceritakan kepadaku tentang dirimu sesuatu yang tidak kusukai maka doakanlah pada allah agar ia memberi hidayah kepada ibu abu hurairah
1185017 hai abu hurairah aku bersaksi bahwa tiada ilah selain allah dan sesungguhnya muhammad adalah utusan allah

1185024 the choices we make in november and the next few years will shape the next decade if not the century
1185025 central to all of these major changes is the question of what we will do about our addiction to foreign oil
1185026 he wants to tax producers of energy more for a gimmicky 1 000 which will end up raising energy costs gasoline costs over the long run
1185027 his plan makes manufacturing less competitive in the world and your energy prices more expensive
1185028 im not giving the gavel away to a tactic that supports big oil at the cost and the expense of the consumer
1185029 while i still dont believe that it is a particularly meaningful short term or long term solution i am willing to consider it if it is necessary to actually pass a comprehensive plan
1185030 we found there is in fact a lot of money in the equity markets that wants to invest
1185031 were planning on building 20 plants in seven years were going to have 1 billion gallons of production
1185032 we foresee cellulosic ethanol online in a few years at a production price that is cheaper than gasoline the government mandates are reasonable targets and i think they will be met and probably exceeded
1185033 the farm bill is really helping raise capital because its ameliorating the risk
1185034 for the most part oil above 60 a barrel will allow some pretty significant competition at 100 a barrel or more it allows for more entrants
1185035 we are confident we will be able to make ethanol for less than a dollar a gallon within three years
1185036 there are some investors who wont get involved in ethanol of any type because of the adverse publicity corn based ethanol has gotten
1185037 we believe that we are prepared to deal with any kind of security threat and we are confident and capable of hosting a peaceful and safe games
1185038 the uighur people do not support acts that engender bloodshed
1185039 to view regarding uighur terrorist acts with caution as government authorities consistently fail to provide evidence to back up their claims
1185040 people are coming up to me saying this is a common sense sensible way to deal with the issue of personal use
1185041 stone foundations discovered during the excavation are probably part of the chapel some of the burials were just a few centimetres below the ground surface but unusually for west wales bone preservation was very good
1185042 no artefacts were found however four radiocarbon dates indicate use of the cemetery between the 12th and 15th centuries ad
1185043 theyve got to have a bit of bubbly the shareholders
1185044 i just saw the dark knight and i thought it was a work of art i thought it was immaculate
1185045 ah damn it if i could just do what i want to do and get that r that i want the picture would be better so i am saying im not afraid of a pg13 rating at all we are not rooting for anything and im not going to let the fan base down trying to target a rating the only people that would give us a hard time bout that would indeed be the studios which you have to respect because they put a lot of money behind the making of the film
1185046 the hardware guys couldnt make a chip until there was software out there we had a stalemate
1185047 think of it as a key to unlock the next era of computing the many core era
1185048 its a bit like a supercomputer on a chip really the sky is the limit in terms of what software makers can do with it
1185049 it is important for industry to work in tandem with academia to unleash the immense power of parallel computing
1185050 were quickly moving the computing industry to a many core world
1185051 to to kick start an industry wide effort to create and optimize software for the dozens hundreds and thousands of cores expected to power future computers
1185052 theres a chance he might be able to dh or maybe play sometime soon
1185053 as far as when we still dont know we just dont want to have him to have a setback on it dont want to lose him again its getting close
1185054 we think hes a hero but hes a humble guy he just doesnt want to be known that way
1185055 hes got soft tissue damage theres an apparent crack in his hip but overall hes doing great
1185056 this is the worst tragedy in the history of the company
1185057 it took a while for them to figure it out
1185058 you have to understand its pretty thick forest and even though there was a fire the canopy was 150 feet over their head so it was pretty difficult to find them
1185059 it was critical to know that there were still people alive on the ground
1185060 anytime you have to call a friend to co ordinate search and rescue its got to come into question
1185061 a seasoned pilot hes got over 3 500 hours flying with about 2 500 of that with float planes he was a very likable guy
1185062 obviously its a close knit community a close group you know of people and employees and its pretty sombre today
1185063 its been a tragic day and tragic time for us
1185064 probably went in there to chamiss bay a hundred times
1185065 i tried to explain what happened for whatever reason they werent trying to hear it i thought at the worst i would get a penalty and not get ejected what made it worse is the sour taste you get because of the loss
1185066 my intention when i went to hagans was just to check on him and see if he was all right i didnt think i had to explain because its football and hes right behind the linebackers
1185067 i asked him he was all right and he said no im not all right i kind of sensed he had attitude and left him alone
1185068 my ejection i would like to think it had some bearing on the game
1185069 any starter would feel like they could come in and contribute but we were still in good shape to win the game
1185070 i didnt do a great job of being a pro
1185071 my mindset was devastated the divorce came out of the blue and it seems to me i didnt know how to handle it i was devastated especially after losing the custody battle
1185072 im thankful the organization gave me an opportunity to come back up
1185073 i m here now and feel things are behind me
1185074 i feel at ease on the field like being there is easing the pain away
1185075 it makes it hard trying to figure out what the new guys can do and how they fit in the picture
1185076 wieso soll ich mich anstrengen sie wird mir ja sowieso verzeihen

1185135 we have had visitors one of whom dr lynne hazard is a first cousin once removed in law a consulting psychologist she looks as lady scientists do in stories but rarely in real life tall blond and gorgeous i asked her about a psychological curiosum i have often met in my biographical work on lovecraft and howard why should a grown man form so intense an emotional tie to another whom he never knew personally and who in fact died before he was born that if anyone says anything about his idol that does not present his hero in a wholly saintly and heroic light the admirer is furiously resentful takes the statment as a personal affront that he is duty bound to avenge and spends years trying to get even with the author of the statement since the resentful one never knew his idol his infatuation is not with the real man but only with his mental image he has built up from what he has heard or read dr hazard said yes she had met such obsessions she said the worshipful follower was usually conscious of a void within himself this might be a lack of some quality he desired or an egregious failure in business trade profession or personal relationships so the follower identifies himself with his adoree and cannot admit that his hero has any flaws like those of other human beings whatever since that means confessing his own short comings i wont apply this diagnose to any present or former fellow rehupans but others may if they wish

1185145 these animals need our help to protect their natural habitat as well as facilitate conservation programs throughout the country that are helping new generations of wildlife stewards and conservationists

1185219 a new approach to storing electrical energy can store more energy than gasoline in the same volume and could help extend the range of electric vehicles
1185220 but thats two fold higher than the practical storage capacity of gasoline
1185221 british motorists may now enjoy the novelty of buying gasoline made from coal which has just been placed on public sale the event marks the beginning of a great chemical industry by which england hopes to put 65 000 men to work and to end her dependence upon imported petroleum a monster plant now rising at billingham on tees will transform 1 000 tons of coal daily into the synthetic fuel using a process already in successful operation in a smaller experimental plant at the same site in this process known as hydrogenation powdered coal is mixed with heavy oil and the resulting paste is fed with hydrogen gas to a converter the mixture undergoes a chemical transformation under tremendous heat and pressure yielding a mixture of hydrocarbons from which pure gasoline is recovered by distillation another of the products is diesel oil which may also be changed into gasoline by an additional conversion treatment with hydrogen both the hydrogen and heavy oil used in the process are obtained in the course of producing the gasoline leaving coal as the chief raw material required results of production indicate that approximately a gallon of gasoline may be obtained from twenty four pounds of coal and the large scale plant under construction should show an output of 80 000 gallons of gasoline a day
1185222 a northamptonshire man destroyed his garage and badly injured himself at the weekend while attempting to make biodiesel from used cooking oil a devastating explosion levelled the makeshift reprocessing plant on saturday afternoon when sparks from an electric drill being used to mix ingredients ignited explosive vapours firemen hastened to deal with the smoking wreckage in middleton cheney and the unnamed thrifty motorist was airlifted to hospital with 20 per cent burns the injured biodiesel fancier reportedly made motor fuel from used cooking oil obtained from his local chinese takeaway such oil can often be used in diesel vehicles without preparation but this will typically knacker the engine in short order it is normal to treat the oil with alcohol and other ingredients before use and this process was apparently underway when the mishap occurred the explosion would most probably have been caused initially by alcohol fumes building up in the garage a process likely enhanced by the hot weather this weekend open air or at least better ventilated biodiesel manufacture might have been wiser

1185224 after months of intensive research and experimental trials the day4 energy company has developed a design and manufacturing process for its generation ii solar cells with efficiency up to 19 percent on mono crystalline and 18 percent on multi crystalline silicon materials
1185225 our first generation 14 7 percent efficiency day4 mc module which has been in commercial production since 2006 already places us among the industrys highest performing multi crystalline products
1185226 with the second generation of our proprietary solar cell designs we are taking a major step towards making solar energy cost competitive with conventional sources of electrical power generation
1185227 on the oxygen side it doesnt work well and you have to put way more energy in than needed to get the oxygen out
1185228 its cheap its efficient its highly manufacturable its incredibly tolerant of impurity and its from earth abundant stuff
1185229 we had not confirmed more than six in any one year of the previous five years
1185230 its a group made up of leadership from all these scientific and engineering societies a niche detroit does really well in this was one great big site inspection for us
1185231 they loved the people mover they got out and they walked around and they felt safe
1185232 there were things to do people around and that is not what they remember for the most part
1185233 its a big one its someones livelihood i think hes had enough chances and to go down this track it just takes it over the edge so i would think maybe yes
1185234 i think just the protectionism that eddies trying to give his club to save the image in fact is detrimental to the very thing youre trying to build and thats the culture
1185235 he mcguire loves the club hes got passion for the club but this has been behind the scenes and theyve always said they can handle it
1185236 well its four times in the last two years that this has happened they arent handling it well at all
1185237 next year that didak comes up oh no well change that now we think its detrimental to the team and you shouldnt impact the players
1185238 well its like i said you make your bed you lie in it
1185239 you will get some people that we cant be with them every minute of the day while theyre making their decisions and all we can do is we can give them the support prior and we can make them accountable afterwards and they have to deal with the consequences

1185241 it is kind of a miracle you dont quite know how it happens
1185242 in the case of bilbao they asked for sydney opera house when we started but they had a comprehensive plan for the community foster did the subway system jim stirling was doing a train station that never happened calatrava did the airport and everybody did a vineyard
1185243 so there was sort of an intent to change the community and it worked
1185244 cincinnati has a great downtown and at least five beautiful and safe neighborhoods with good local schools that the kids can walk to i could live in cincinnati

1185250 the thing is ive got two places in my speech where i know im going to have to back off its going to get very emotional
1185251 yeah ive got a couple of places in mine too and i know where they are
1185252 you know what if were not excited and emotional about tomorrow then we have no business being here
1185253 how do you feel with the build up to this
1185254 well ive got a good analogy when i was in college and i played football the game is on saturday but the build up begins on monday and as the days go by wednesday thursday now the adrenaline is starting to build the excitement is there and all of a sudden its saturday and youve got a game that afternoon
1185255 these guys are real fans they love to do what they are doing

1185260 but i was worried it wouldnt grow back and left tackle anthony davis no longer has the mohawk
1185261 even more were even closer now kordells the greatest guy
1185262 i believe that beijings olympics are now facing real threats from terrorist attacks
1185263 i think the olympics are the most important international sports event in four years
1185264 and its the biggest focus of the international media in four years so this might draw some attention from terrorist groups
1185265 our aim is to target the most critical points related to the olympics we will try to attack chinese central cities severely using the tactics that have never been employed
1185266 the government is worried that this human rights torch will detract attention from china
1185267 they didnt beat me but there are different kinds of intimidation
1185268 one girl remarked she couldnt believe this land nourished shakespeare and dickens another asked where is the gentlemenship
1185269 many who had romantic views of the west are very disappointed at the medias attempt to demonise china
1185270 police forces the peoples armed police the peoples liberation army and the health environmental protection meteorology and transportation departments
1185271 the chief advantage of chinas role in the region is its lack of political baggage
1185272 sydney we did something similar but it really reached a particular i suppose a crescendo after 9 11
1185273 so it is fairly complicated process but it does involve ultimately the possibility of extreme action being taken against any aviation interloper that is coming into the airspace
1185274 experiences of past games show that terrorist attacks may occur before the games so our anti terrorist forces have been in action ahead of the opening ceremony
1185275 we will never allow the terrorists to attack the games i will stop them once i have found any clue
1185276 this exercise is the culmination of a triennial exercise cycle that gives port agencies and maritime industry the opportunity to test interagency coordination communications and plans
1185277 the lessons learned from this exercise will be used to update the area maritime security plan and agency response plans
1185278 sent shock waves to every corner of the media landscape
1185279 the person who actually presses the button to make the recording supplies the necessary element of volition not the person who manufactures maintains or if distinct from the operator owns the machine
1185280 cablevision more closely resembles a store proprietor who charges customers to use a photocopier on his premises and it seems incorrect to say without more that such a proprietor makes any copies when his machines are actually operated by his customers
1185281 i will step back from my day to day producing work on american idol and will be devoting my time to the new enterprise
1185282 he is an extraordinarily talented producer whose creative contributions to the no 1 show on television have been immeasurable
1185283 we spend money to come here with our families its an inexpensive place to stay if they were to say evacuate then yeah we would do it but otherwise no
1185284 this is not the time of year for anyone along the texas coast to be interrupted by these storms
1185285 edouard is not going to have that large of an affect on tourism because its not expected to cause severe damage
1185286 hell just be a little tropical storm tike compared to big mammas that rip things up and spike gas prices
1185287 council was surprised at the cost to repair the bridge and havent allocated funds to specifically address the extra cost
1185288 if we lose it there could be implications for tourism and land holders who have properties on either side of the crossing
1185289 people should vote for a rural representative who has their interest at heart and is willing to pursue council to get justice and equity for all rate payers
1185290 i will not only make ensure that rural rate payers who make up about 20 per cent of the shire get a fair wack but council also needs a fresh outlook on things which i can provide
1185291 water is a major issue for our future so the health of our rivers particularly the murrumbidgee needs to be maintained
1185292 i would also like to see this shire become eco friendly and for people to really think about energy and water conservation and best practice building standards that create energy conservation
1185293 we could set an example to others in the state and country and become a shire that has a sense of responsibility for the future
1185294 i was surprised at how many people would love to move to the country
1185295 young families seem to be the main ones to enquire and the mothers want to know what facilities your district can provide
1185296 i encourage sydneysiders to move to the country and consider a change of scene and any teachers or would be teachers to make the move
1185297 there are a whole lot of benefits of teaching in a rural school
1185298 they had to use the jaws of life to extract him from the vehicle
1185299 he was lucid conscious he was talking joking with some of the rescue workers at one point
1185300 theres no indication that either alcohol or drugs were involved
1185301 it is chaos but we are managing it and having a wonderful time
1185302 shiloh calls them her babies she and z pick out their clothes and help change and hold them its sweet they are little mommies
1185303 if they had been conceived through ivf we would have been happy to discuss it
1185304 but we have been fortunate never to have had fertility problems
1185305 has a broken arm broken elbow and minor shoulder damage but is in good spirits
1185306 he is having a little bit of surgery this afternoon or tomorrow to help correct the damage
1185307 he says hell be ok and is looking forward to a full recovery
1185308 he was lucid conscious he was talking joking with some of the rescue workers at one point
1185309 theres no indication that either alcohol or drugs were involved
1185310 hes been the best ambassador our state has ever had
1185311 he could live anywhere in the world and he came back home
1185312 i just think it shows a lot about him as a person and how grounded he is
1185313 anyone have a really good or very upsetting customer service story
1185314 um hi we were just over there and rented a video game for my son you probably remember him he was the little guy with the big blue eyes and pocket full of change he counted out all his hard earned allowance money there in front of you you remember us right
1185315 well it seems this video game is too difficult for him and id like to exchange it for another one can we just bring it right back and have him pick out something thats easier for him to play
1185316 uh no maam thats not our policy were not able to exchange video games
1185317 but we were just there less than 5 minutes ago he cant play this game its too hard for him why cant we just swap it out for another one
1185318 sorry were not able to do it its in our policy
1185319 but but why didnt you say anything all these years
1185320 the fiscal report doesnt surprise me as this council has developed a broad range of services in the community without the need for additional loans or the sale of council land
1185321 council will continue to hold adequate development reserves to maintain a sustainable operation
1185322 the money was promised at the last federal election and is part of a 9 2 million package negotiated for water around the region
1185323 i was always interested in agriculture i grew up on a farm
1185324 i want to get a job on a property somewhere when i finish
1185325 its a wonderful gesture from nsw farmers that they are prep to support young farmers in this way
1185326 to achieve that at 17 is a pretty big thing
1185327 5 000 is a lot of money it will go toward the cost of living while he is away which is very hard to budget for
1185328 it will also help out with travelling as a lot of study is off campus
1185329 the whole campus is broken into zones and different teams work them planting raking and weeding
1185330 7 people for midday on the first day is an outstanding achievement im not at the festival not for a few weeks anyway but ive heard of dozens of shows that were cancelled on the first day because of a lack of audience so for you to get that many people is a really positive sign for the future if you keep working hard and doing your best your show will be the talk of the festival
1185331 being a new daddy with a 3 month old little angel emi sofia at home
1185332 we predict their risk and then check that prediction with the real cases and see how accurately we predict that somebody might develop cancer down the road
1185333 bone density is a marker not the cause of breast cancer
1185334 dont be afraid to continue to take medication for osteoporosis
1185335 yo im dope i know how to do this i could do this in my sleep now what
1185336 evangelicals dont have popes they have leaders with names like dr dobson chuck colson rick warren billy graham and albert mohler unless you have a death wish suck it up fly to colorado springs
1185337 dr dobson would gladly open his door to either candidate for a discussion of issues vital to the family
1185338 always understood dr dobsons role and influence to be far larger
1185339 many moms listen to his show as they car pool their kids around or run errands
1185340 they trust him on issues of childrearing and want to hear his opinion on other issues as well
1185341 its a deposit of trust built up over 30 years
1185342 how many years is it going to take before the gay community acknowleges that homosexuality is an immutable
1185343 i understand that during the political season all types of accusations and statistics are thrown around but one thing always stays constant that is the truth
1185344 police are investigating the arrival of campaigners believed to have breached their bail conditions but we cannot confirm how many arrests have been made
1185345 im pretty nervous about being arrested because ive never been to prison it will be bad but the worst thing about being arrested will be that i wont get to go to an event that i have been planning for a long time this is one of the most important issues of our generation and its vital that we are allowed to discuss it its tragic that the police seem to want to stop that
1185346 i have won out over the adversity of being on american idol
1185347 inside a soda shoppe where we sit and have chaste fun
1185348 we looked at half of australias remaining forests and our estimate is they can store around 33 billion tonnes of co2 these are very big numbers
1185349 if all those forests were cleared and all of the carbon in the biomass in the soil released into the atmosphere that would be the equivalent of about 80 per cent of australias annual emissions every year for 100 years so we really have to protect our natural forests
1185350 its the big old trees that have a very high amount of carbon and also the coarse woody debris the dead standing trees and the dead logs on the ground that are there in the natural undisturbed forests
1185351 i think what weve got at the moment is drought and i think that we have to recognise that weve got drought
1185352 its just completely unacceptable for any government to throw their hands in the air and say this is all getting a bit hard i think that well call it climate change and well pull back on support
1185353 we used absolutely the minimum force necessary to ensure safe access and entry routes to and from the site
1185354 however the response from protesters including those who have locked on to the vehicles causing the obstruction has required us to increase our presence on the site
1185355 the police are claiming the vehicles were blocking the emergency exit and were abandoned both of which are lies
1185356 the prospect of going to prison is a daunting one but e ons proposed new coal fired power station poses such a threat to the climate that its something were willing to face
1185357 if anyone is found to have breached their bail conditions they will be arrested
1185358 according to the meteorology agency this years dry season is very dry not wet like last year thats the problem
1185359 looking at the fluctuation of hot spots this year could be worse than last
1185360 all the 50 million has bought is a promise in the future of water it has bought air space it will not put any water in the murray river at this time
1185361 they should not be willy nilly trying to buy water at this time there is no plan
1185362 when you speak to those who have been charged with buying the water they concede there was no plan they just bought the cheapest water they could which was buying air space in dams it did not actually buy water at this time
1185363 for the first time and after years of inaction the environment will have an entitlement as governments allocate water
1185364 if all those forests were cleared and all of the carbon in the biomass in the
1185365 why stop at a top rate of 455 pounds why not go further
1185366 there is perhaps a danger that the proposed changes are large enough to be noticed but not large enough to change behaviour
1185367 if climate change really is as important and urgent as the government frequently and rightly acknowledges then it would suggest there is a strong and defensible case for much more penal taxes on high emissions cars
1185368 a failure to advertise green tax details to the public breeds suspicion about their objectives increasing the perception of them as revenue raising measures with no environmental purpose
1185369 these reforms will take two billion pounds from motorists already struggling with high fuel costs and risk making transport less affordable for any but the rich
1185370 it just shows the tragic level of authoritarianism when the police are cracking down on a group of people who simply want to get together to discuss the most important issue facing the world
1185371 if there are changes in the amount of ice cover in the antarctic then it means there are going to be changes in the amount of habitat that the whales have available to them
1185372 and were not sure how adaptable they are to living in a different kind of habitat
1185373 at some point they wont be able to interbreed even if they wanted to
1185374 the pace of the development of bioenergy markets and the resource requirements to feed them will disrupt the entire southern wood fiber market
1185375 it will be much steeper and more disruptive than that of the osb market over the last 15 years we recommend that forest products companies begin planning for the future by establishing stronger relationships with their suppliers and creating more efficient transportation lines
1185376 we were beginning to see the effects of new energy markets in the delivered prices for pulpwood chips and wood fuel in some areas in the south
1185377 we thought it was time to take a closer look using the breadth and depth of our data to determine what the competitive landscape for wood fiber might look like in 10 or 15 years
1185378 youve got to say right heres the line in the sand were going to stop it here because its madness to continue
1185379 it doesnt paint a very good picture of the future for carbon emissions but there is no other real choice coal is one of the few fuel sources which has a real capacity to expand
1185380 i dont think in my lifetime i will ever see more than 50 percent of the coal fired plants in china being fitted with ccs
1185381 i think you resign yourself to the fact that youll only be able to stabilize democratic republic of congo congo basin passes 1 million ha milestone in swing to sustainable forestry
1185382 their best efforts to do right by the law and sound science have been subverted by actions taken by or not taken by johnson our administrator
1185383 a lot of them are certainly hurt by the impact on their professional reputations
1185384 speaks for itself and the administrator is proud of the work the staff completed at his direction
1185385 relatively ineffective at reducing greenhouse gas concentrations given the potentially damaging effect on jobs and the u s economy
1185386 we believe epas hardworking dedicated staff has earned more respect than you are giving
1185387 a 10 centimeter rise in sea level will result in marine encroachment of 2 10 meters which will have a serious effect on real estate erosion of the coastal kurkar ridges will wreck infrastructures
1185388 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
1185389 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
1185390 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
1185391 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
1185392 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
1185393 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
1185394 with rampant illegal logging vague logging concession boundaries and massive blocks of pristine forest destined for the chainsaw this is a laudable step towards avoiding an ecological disaster
1185395 while the certified forests will have to be maintained according to acceptable international standards there is urgent need for other timber business operations in the region to adopt responsible forest management practices in order to ensure the conservation of this unique forest ecosystem for the benefit of people in the region and the world
1185396 illegal forest exploitation and forest crimes are largely due to poor governance and insufficient law enforcement
1185397 wwf also recognizes that responsible forest management plays an important role in the economic growth of tropical countries and reducing poverty in forest communities
1185398 wwf is convinced that the adoption of responsible forestry schemes by logging companies will contribute greatly to the conservation of the congo basin forests and towards improving the national economy and also improve the livelihoods of local communities
1185399 for the success of responsible forestry in the congo basin there is a high need for government to set up enabling conditions that include enacting adequate legislation and enforcement and promoting good governance while providing support to responsible forestry initiatives
1185400 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1185401 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1185402 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1185403 he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact he raised more than one million dollars from big oil just last month
1185404 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1185405 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires
1185406 if given a choice between a skilled physician and one with a charming manner i would of course choose the one with skill with dr bill rubin no such choice is necessary he was recommended to us repeatedly worked overtime with dr mcgonigle and is indeed a skilled oncologist also he is able to relate to his patients and their families in a professional comfortable and congenial manner the most unforgettable thing about him is his gift of humor like many very bright people his humor is droll piquant original and wonderfully funny
1185407 in between spaces such as public transport lobbies shopping plazas and underpasses are typically overlooked and relegated to the background only by virtue of their unimportance are they considered to be related rather than classing them as the void between more meaningful places we are considering them in their own right
1185408 wind energy has become an industrial and commercial sector that is in the global vanguard it is one of spains few examples of technological and business leadership creates employment produces high added value and boasts one of the highest indices of investment in research development and innovation
1185409 thank you environmentalists for making the 2002 fire season all it could be
1185410 we would be cutting the trees we should be leaving
1185411 it does bother the court that those most responsible from his company will never face these kinds of consequences and thats the way the law is
1185412 over the years the united states has sent many of its fine young men and women into great peril to fight for freedom beyond our borders the only amount of land we have ever asked for in return is enough to bury those that did not return
1185413 have you heard the latest dumb stunt bush has done he has sent an aircraft carrier to indonesia to help the tsunami victims what does he intend to do bomb them
1185414 whereas europeans learn many different languages americans learn only english
1185415 why is it that we always have to speak english in these conferences rather than speaking french
1185416 maybe its because the brits canadians aussies and americans arranged it so you wouldnt have to speak german
1185417 then you should know enough to have your passport ready
1185418 the last time i was here i didnt have to show it
1185419 impossible americans always have to show your passports on arrival in france
1185420 well when i came ashore at omaha beach on d day in 1944 to help liberate this
1185421 we want to bring great singing and boyish dance moves being influenced by male dancers such as omarion michael jackson and many more we also want to stay true to ourselves and be positive for young females out there
1185422 intuition anecdote theology and sheer faith to be more reliable sources of evidence
1185423 this will be the first of a many part series that is going to be the fod program the f off dixon program
1185424 as you can see im wearing the appropriate apparel on my head and no doubt there are shirts out there with the fod symbol on it
1185425 if you see any one of the employees wearing hats like this or shirts just remember fod program
1185426 the unions are trying to bully me into a place where i dont want to be with a five per cent increase of their wages
1185427 i think its suitable they only get three per cent and i think three per cent is quite sufficient even though i did take a 21 per cent increase in my wages from 2006 and 2007 but dont worry about me
1185428 we will be focusing on key areas such as maintenance safety systems within the airline and the way qantas is managing recent incidents
1185429 so the civil aviation safety authority will be digging deep with a special team to make sure that everything is being done properly
1185430 this is on top of our normal safety checks that we do on qantas week in week out just to make sure that safety standards remain as high as possible
1185431 the pilot has some pressurisation warnings about a door on the left hand side of the aircraft but exactly what went wrong is still being determined
1185432 im looking at the plane now and on the left hand side just forward of the wing theres a gaping hole from the wing to the underbody
1185433 its about two metres by four metres and theres baggage hanging out so you assume that theres a few bags that may have gone missing
1185434 there was a terrific boom and bits of wood and debris just flew forward into first class and the oxygen masks dropped down
1185435 we were told that one of the rear doors a hole had blown into it but ive since looked at the plane and theres a gigantic gaping hole in the plane
1185436 it was absolutely terrifying but i have to say everyone was very calm
1185437 i had my seat belt on and i strapped it on a bit tighter put the mask over my head and from then on it was like what happens happens
1185438 we are concerned at any job losses and will be
1185439 qantas has said there will be some compulsory redundancies and

1185964 on sunday july 27 i was diagnosed with a brain tumor
1185965 i will be suspending my journalistic work for an indefinite but god willing not too lengthy period
1185966 the turning point came one friday night at the home of sister lean a new adventist who ran a small guest house in edinburgh
1185967 the time had come id done my homework in my bible on my knees i knew romans 14 through and through by now and i knew what i had to do so i led the charge and we polished off the sandwiches all of them it was the right thing to do i knew it then without a doubt and i know it still
1185968 better to walk 10 000 miles than to read 10 000 books
1185969 remember this on your way up the dog was once a pup
1185970 the secret of a secret is to know when and how to tell it
1185971 i think one of the misunderstandings and stereotypes is that this group adventists is a cult because of their unique practice of sabbath
1185972 we certainly did view them as more of a separatist group than what we have discovered
1185973 we found them to be ecumenically engaged consistent with major christianity on major points of faith writings of e g white one of the adventist churchs founders are not scripture for them
1185974 and it was also our misunderstanding that they want to be a separatist group and not be involved with the wider church
1185975 this is not the first we have engaged in overtures of many different groups
1185976 as i understand it the move on the adventist side was prompted by their feeling that they wanted to be considered as more a part of mainstream evangelicalism than they had in the past and so they wanted to have a top level theological discussion to clarify the current situation
1185977 guardedness because they started out as a movement that essentially denied the adequacy of existing churches
1185978 i think the average presbyterian thinks theyre some small sect
1185979 i discovered theyre probably not too far behind us in worldwide population theyre much larger than we realize yet theyre not on our radar for whatever reason
1185980 what if you made a list of all the things you are afraid of doing
1185981 my summer vacation last year was a lot of fun we went to norway where my sisters husband is from and we all traveled together as a family and then we went over to london which i thought was great because it was my first time there and then we went to new york and hung out with some friends before we came back to colorado
1185982 so what did you do for your last summer vacation
1185983 last summer was amazing it was so great my sister married this unbelievably cool guy from norway and shes been really happy with him my sister is somebody that i really didnt think would find somebody but she found this guy and he treats her great and hes really big into family they want to have a big extended family so he invited me to come to norway of course i paid for my ticket and everything i mean he was generous with his heart but he didnt like treat everybody
1185984 so it was amazing ive never been to norway before and it was just so fantastic especially in the summertime it stays light
1185985 i hope you are going to be able to rescue me right now

1186050 our purpose was to explore methods of making images of nanoscale objects on the time scale of atomic motions a length and time regime that promises to become accessible with advances in free electron lasers
1186051 the technique we used is called massively parallel x ray fourier transform holography with coded apertures what inspired me to try this approach was the pinhole camera
1186052 the room had to be dark for the good reason that a sharp image requires a small pinhole but a small pinhole also produces a dim image
1186053 to get a brighter image without lenses you have to use many pinholes the problem then becomes how to assemble the information including depth information from the overlapping shadow images this is where coded apertures come in
1186054 what would happen if we put a ura right next to an object we were imaging with the x ray beamline it should allow us to create a holographic image one with orders of magnitude more intensity than a standard hologram
1186055 imaging with coherent x rays will be a key technique for developing nanoscience and nanotechnology and massively parallel holography will be an enabling tool in this quest

1186111 when li qiu the former mayor of beijing traveled to moscow in 2001 as head of the beijing 2008 olympic games bidding committee delegation he declared that if the games were awarded to china they would
1186112 china nonetheless has an obligation to uphold international laws that protect freedom of expression the right to hold opinions and the right to information
1186113 us officials believe that economic development and trade are eventually going to bring democracy to china
1186114 the europeans and asians now are rushing to do business in china try to convince them just as the americans do that china is changing that their trade and investments are helping to bring political liberalization to china
1186115 now more than half of chinas trade is controlled by foreign firms many of which import goods into the country that they then manufacture into exports foreign companies have pumped up chinas trade volume enough to make the country the third largest trading country in the world behind the united states and germany and now ahead of japan
1186116 there are risks when a nation depends on the individual dreams of 1 3 billion people rather than a coherent political system with clear rule of law
1186117 without the claim that trade would open up the chinese political system trade legislation would not have been enacted
1186118 it seems as if china is going to remain a deeply repressive country but lets pass this trade bill anyway
1186119 as a department of the communist party central committee the propaganda department outranks government ministries or the state council information office and dominates the processes of media censorship
1186120 anything related to individual leaders the communist party democracy political reform protests discussions in government meetings the 1989 tiananmen demonstrations human rights faun gong religion corruption at the top taiwan tibet and other topics that the propaganda department considers politically sensitive because they could subvert party power is forbidden
1186121 according to harvard universitys berkam center china operates the most extensive and technologically sophisticated systems of internet filtering in the world
1186122 american companies like cisco yahoo microsoft and google in order to do business in the lucrative china market have swallowed their scruples and cooperated with the chinese government in censoring searches
1186123 one can count on the fact that every few months or so chinas security apparatus will lock up a least a few political dissenters or intellectuals or journalists or religious adherents or others who defy the restrictions of the one party state
1186124 in china the role traditionally has been to support the government by spreading propaganda and suppressing news that contradicts policy or puts officials in a bad light
1186125 arrests of dissidents and of people accused of forming opposition groups or of carrying out
1186126 the criminal law of the peoples republic of china contains a section on
1186127 these laws cover a range of legitimate crimes but both include provisions that are vague and overbroad allowing for arbitrary enforcement by the state
1186128 laws are passed along with sanctions that may be applied if someone fails to live up to those standards all violations need not be punished to maintain the coercive power of the laws so long as the authorities energetically pursue the most dramatic violations and impose severe penalties on those found guilty of the most heinous crimes
1186129 the crackdown on individual journalists newspapers and websites in china has continued over the last year raising serious doubts about chinas commitment to ensure complete media freedom during the beijing olympics
1186130 it is very serious that the official promises are not being kept before the games
1186131 freedom of the press and human rights constitute the most serious problem currently facing china
1186132 his only crime had been to help more than 10 000 farmers in fujin city in heilongjiang to draw up a petition entitled
1186133 yang chunlins is a classic case of infringing freedom of speech the way that the chinese communist government handled the case clearly violates the olympic spirit
1186134 broad and vaguely defined state secrets and subversion charges in the criminal law continue to be used to arbitrarily detain and prosecute journalists editors and internet users
1186135 since mid 2007 media freedom appears to have worsened many foreign correspondents we spoke with say they continue to face serious obstacles whenever the issues on which they wish to report are deemed sensitive by central or local authorities
1186136 the authorities need to start respecting the new regulations first we have monitored 65 cases of foreign journalists being arrested beaten prevented from doing a report or threatened since the new rules were supposed to take effect on 1 january and the day before the ministers statement an associated press reporter was detained in southern china
1186137 at least 10 correspondents have reported receiving anonymous death threats according to a foreign correspondents club of china fccc report released today the group listed more than 50 incidences of official interference in reporting on recent unrest in the tibet autonomous region and tibetan areas of western provinces of china
1186138 the database with information on the 28 000 foreign journalists expected for the olympics would be a reference for interview subjects designed to protect them from being tricked or blackmailed by
1186139 in the traditional meeting with the press on november 13th liu jianchao denied everything and said that the article was inexact
1186140 the power of the state signifies perhaps the most obvious form of coercion in the modern world
1186141 the result is that during a period when reporting freedoms for foreign journalists in china should be at an all time high correspondents face severe difficulties in accessing
1186142 the chinese governments 2001 bid to host the 2008 olympics was successful in part because china pledged to improve media freedom and the ioc believed that international attention to china would help improve the human rights situation
1186143 two weekends ago provincial party officials were told in a conference call to solve problems at home and stop the flow of petitioners into the city lest they disrupt the harmonious atmosphere the government is attempting to maintain in preparation for the olympic games

1186158 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal and that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights that among them are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
1186159 this is kind of what they were saying earlier with what happened with hurricane alicia
1186160 it was nothing big but as time progressed it became a category 3 hurricane
1186161 ive got water batteries bread canned goods and a couple pieces of fruit just in case
1186162 youve got to in case its a couple of days
1186163 i have a freezer full of food that im going to have to eat
1186164 i believe theres a media ten dency to over exaggerate the reality of the truth it scares people who are not from coastal cities
1186165 we want to get it all in today before the storm gets here
1186166 i expect a 40 percent to 50 percent business disruption for two days or more
1186167 on thursday well probably get back in line with normal summer business
1186168 a lot of merchants in the restaurant industry are kind of monitoring their orders so they dont have too much in the refrigerator or freezer that could go bad

1186175 you cant really do any kind of historical evaluation of an individual or an administration without those papers
1186176 they have done a great job in leveling off what started as a rocky road
1186177 so it would imply that people who have a mutation in this gene and are susceptible to cancer have inherently regions of their dna which are duplicated or deleted and therefore are unstable
1186178 and that may have something to do with the mechanism by which they develop cancer
1186179 what is also striking is that with each successive generation the cancers tend to occur earlier in age and may also be more aggressive biologically
1186180 so rather than what we have to do now look for everything at every age which becomes an extreme burden on the patients and their families you may be able to say for such and such a person in the family we only need to focus on this tumour type starting from this age
1186181 hope for the future hope that in an lfs family that the legacy of loss will end
1186182 we know cancer to be basically a disease of genetic instability in the cancer cells and all weve done here is use an unusual model to show that that instability is actually present in every cell in every person
1186183 now i have to pay 1 500 a month which i cant make those kind of payments
1186184 one day the house was 124 000 and the next week it was 179 000 so how in one week can there be such an increase of the price of the house so you can figure it out somebody was manipulating the prices
1186185 its private business responsibility to the community not the taxpayers i dont want my taxpayer money to go in and try to clean that pool up so there isnt west nile virus in my neighborhood
1186186 we illustrated the legislature is taking this probe very seriously what we did is significant in terms of the rights of the homeowners the rights of tenants
1186187 it makes you very mad and makes you feel frustrated but you try to fight and find a solution

1186189 our wishes were to bring her home and have her walk across the stage and graduate said her father pascual hernandez

1186191 there is no need to pull another 200 000 innocent bystanders into this budget morass and without reservation i will continue to refuse to slash the salaries of the dedicated civil servants who keep our state running
1186192 i will not accommodate the request and our payroll system will not accommodate the request
1186193 in 2003 my office tried to see if we could reconfigure our system to do such a task and after 12 months we stopped without a feasible solution and with the knowledge that recovery for such a sweeping adjustment to minimum wage would take at least six months before all employees would see the right amounts in their hard earned paychecks
1186194 the governors order to pay california state workers only the federal minimum wage would put the state in the awkward position of violating its own labor law
1186195 i am just one of the families who despite the hard work we do for the state of california can disappear with the stroke of a pen
1186196 an attempt to entice people to sign away their rights and get out of the country as quickly as possible before even talking to a lawyer
1186197 seeks fewer immigrants but a warmer welcome for those admitted
1186198 the problem is its difficult to know whats causing a change like this
1186199 but the one thing we know for sure is that the country is in a deep economic downturn if not a recession which means theres much less need for workers especially those providing services for the middle class
1186200 immigration is a market driven phenomenon and thats why immigration is beneficial to the economy
1186201 when we need them they come and when we dont they go home has enforcement had some effect perhaps but theres no question that the economic downturn would in and of itself have a huge effect in attracting fewer illegal immigrants and sending more home
1186202 it is important for retailers like us to understand the real financial pressures that are facing uk families particularly when families do not have the choice to opt out like sending their children to school

1186209 chest x ray once a year from now on maybe twice
1186210 we are more than willing to have up to four classes a week if the interest is there
1186211 we understand that a lot of teams in this league are gunning for us and thats something weve had to deal with for the past two years
1186212 i think this is going to be one of the toughest years weve had in a while just with the key players we lost we have younger guys to fill in those positions and if that happens then i dont see any reason for us not to have the same success as weve had the last few years
1186213 weve been playing them for years now its nice to let all of these other guys conference teams get a shot at em
1186214 they played extremely well last year and im really excited about having those guys back weve got four or five starters back
1186215 weve got a great tight end josh gannan coming back so i think it doesnt make a whole lot of difference whos back there in the backfield i think were gonna be good at running the short ball
1186216 but there were a lot of holes that xavier squeaked out of that he really shouldnt have so we might end up missing that
1186217 i think whoever we stick back there will end up being successful we have some younger guys that have been around a while and they know what theyre doing back there as long as we do our job theyll do well i think
1186218 its for a good cause and the hopkins community is always good to help people in need you dont understand until it happens to you even if you have insurance there are extra expenses that you dont count on
1186219 there have been so many advances in medicine and technology in the last few years
1186220 i feel like things will be fine st lukes is a great place for my daughter to be
1186221 we also dont think either of them were traveling at unreasonable speeds
1186222 their receivers their defensive backs theres more team speed in this league that we can see than what we came out of
1186223 on a week to week basis its going to be intriguing
1186224 its just one more team that you just know that if you dont play your best youll get beat
1186225 even if you play your best you might get beat it just makes it that much tougher
1186226 going through this schedule throughout the season makes you better once you get to the playoffs
1186227 uno coming in this year knocks us up another notch
1186228 the season itself is a playoff if you make it through the miaa i think youre pretty set
1186229 immediately our kids said if we can do that we can compete for a national championship
1186230 that mindset has been there i think that mindset now is in a lot of the teams in our conference thats what makes our conference so great
1186231 us coming into the league im going to be honest i dont think thats whats going to make it the strongest league in the country
1186232 i think it has been in the last five years maybe a little bit more since 99
1186233 morgan has a broken arm elbow and has minor shoulder damage but was in good spirits when i spoke with him a short time ago at the elvis presley memorial trauma center at the med a level 1 trauma center at the regional medical center at memphis he is having a little bit of surgery this afternoon or tomorrow to help correct the damage he says hell be okay and is looking forward to a full recovery
1186234 it is with great sadness that we learned craig passed away in the early hours

1186239 he has a broken arm broken elbow and minor shoulder damage but he is in good spirits
1186240 he is going to have surgery this afternoon or tomorrow to correct the damage
1186241 all i can say is one word his condition is serious
1186242 need extra support and understanding from their families employers and the government that would make their lives more manageable enjoyable and guilt free
1186243 high powered lobbying from political leaders who will be attending the ceremony prompted the highest levels of the chinese government to convince him not to attend
1186244 president mugabe attaches great importance to the ongoing talks which is why he is not going to china for the grand opening of the olympics
1186245 probably religion has abdicated its central place in peoples lives
1186246 however the country has now approved legal union of homosexuals and women have access to abortion services
1186247 sexuality and religion are not such different concepts both are ideas and practises constructed by societies that are direct expressions of the culture symbols that play an essential role in social relations
1186248 fulfillment of sexual desire and pleasure have been given high importance in a culture which has allowed space for alternate sexuality
1186249 i demand that the pope apologize to gay men for promoting homophobia
1186250 all fingers are not equal the mother has also made the homosexual
1186251 in order to get the support of religious leaders it is important for a programme to prove its good intentions and do good work that benefits the community
1186252 it was a path breaking effort the leaders said the aids issue cannot be brushed aside especially since it concerns young people
1186253 we cannot expect religious leaders to be upfront about premarital sex and condom use but they do agree for the need to promote responsible sexual behaviour
1186254 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions

1186268 conservatives still think highly of him and are enthusiastic supporters whenever he speaks
1186269 for a campaign that has largely failed in reaching out to conservatives reaching out to cheney wouldnt be a bad idea
1186270 whether anyone can do it or not well find out
1186271 when industries are confronted by challenges they tend to get shellshocked and step back into the foxhole
1186272 my philosophy is the opposite industries need someone to step forward and make the case when people dont understand them
1186273 the finance committee is a bit more of a challenge for labor and progressives
1186274 theres way too much influence from k street lobbyists and rubinistas
1186275 these arent the guys you ought to be listening to these are the guys who brought the economic insanity were dealing with now
1186276 this is the same crowd that helped engineer the credit crunch and the collapse of mortgages
1186277 on a lot of issues they are definitely at odds
1186278 if the agenda that max baucus pushes forward represents the interest of the hamilton project it will be a terrible disservice to the middle class
1186279 campaign finance limits are supposed to prevent the undue influence of big contributors
1186280 by accepting contributions of up to nearly 70 000 mccain and obama have blown a gaping hole in the integrity of our campaign finance system
1186281 there continues to be an infinite number of ways to raise very large sums of money even in the post mccain feingold world
1186282 will add a voice not heard in any concerted way before in the energy debate that of the thousands of businesses large and small which depend upon affordable energy supplies to operate
1186283 the coalition will support initiatives which encourage conservation and the development of renewable and alternative energy sources
1186284 our focus will be on increasing domestic oil and gas production since alternative sources will not be able to meet u s demand for the next 25 years or more
1186285 it was unjust at every level for the individual and for society as a whole
1186286 we are taking our case to the senate in particular and highlighting the fact that adding wind coverage is unnecessary
1186287 its an integral part of a basic homeowners policy to have the government step in where the private market is already is contrary to common sense
1186288 the strength is there but its more that i cant locate or finish the pitch
1186289 put down whatever social drugs you were using when the trade deadline came and went and start promoting from within
1186290 have been characterized as an effort by the natural gas industry to capture market share from coal
1186291 they were not purchased by the natural gas industry and were not developed with the knowledge of the industry
1186292 marks a disturbing departure from the understanding we tacitly share in the energy industries to avoid denigrating competing fuels
1186293 our country needs all forms of energy we cant afford to leave any out
1186294 we probably had some false starts in our messaging earlier this year
1186295 our clients want to comply they have a lot of questions
1186296 but theres increased hope that the clerk of the house and the secretary of the senate will fix these problems quickly and perhaps provide some additional guidance that can be practically followed
1186297 my staff will go to individual meetings with the staff of the governors people
1186298 is good as far as it goes but it doesnt go far enough
1186299 while special interest lobbyists outnumber socially responsible lobbyists by a major factor there are many lobbyists who do remarkable work for the public good
1186300 its an honorable tradition and something thats essential to the fabric of our democracy
1186301 the real problem that needs to be discussed here is the influence of money not lobbying

1186307 to be quite honest and practical i dont think theyll ever find who done it
1186308 anyone who knows me knows it is not in my make up at all no one but no one should do that to a human being
1186309 i cannot begin to understand what they might be going through i can only say that i am not the perpetrator i am not the killer i just hope they get justice
1186310 lets look at the question that is being asked is there dna from madeleine on the swab it would be very simple to say yes simply because of the number of components within the result that are also in her reference sample what we need to consider as scientists is whether the match is genuine because madeleine has deposited dna as a result of being in the car or whether madeleine merely appears to match the result by chance
1186311 we cannot answer the question is the match genuine or is it a chance match
1186312 the petitions in boxes behind me ask a very simple question for coloradans to answer in november should we make investments in the future of colorado or should we continue to pay an unnecessary 300 million subsidy to an industry that doesnt need it
1186313 i heard the plane above and thought gosh its awfully low and awfully early
1186314 because it was so foggy i couldnt see any smoke plumes
1186315 who the f do you people think you are what the f is wrong with you aiming right at me
1186316 we spend money to come here with our families its an inexpensive place to stay if they were to say evacuate then yeah we would do it but otherwise no
1186317 this is not the time of year for anyone along the texas coast to be interrupted by these storms
1186318 edouard is not going to have that large of an affect on tourism because its not expected to cause severe damage
1186319 hell just be a little tropical storm tike compared to big mammas that rip things up and spike gas prices
1186320 the most surprising part about becoming a parent how much my view of the world has changed including how i both gained additional understanding for my parents and yet also felt additional confusion
1186321 the most surprising thing for me throughout pregnancy and now while nursing my twins is how different men and women really are physically my husband cant do as much for the boys as i do nursing and emotionally we respond to them in different but both loving ways
1186322 no further evacuations are planned at this time and based on current information and forecast we do not expect any impact on shell operated production in the gulf of mexico
1186323 exxonmobil is determining which of its facilities may potentially be in the path of the storm preparing those structures for heavy wind and rain and identifying personnel for possible evacuation to shore
1186324 it sounds scary to sit here and talk about it
1186325 were just trying to get together a great group for the first game of the year i have every confidence it will happen

1186344 so if you want to give your girlfriend who works in the senate an engagement ring you are going to have to ask permission from not only her father but also from her senator and maybe from the ethics committee too
1186345 drawing nice clean lines with us and them to battle over makes for far more successful direct mail solicitations than actually solving problems

1186347 the irs began to more aggressively audit new york state legislators
1186348 the committee believes that congress should review the matter and provide what clarity it believes necessary

1186350 we worried about the massive amount of force that was aligned against us but we felt that the policy was on our side
1186351 lobbyists will move lunches and dinners to the campaign side of things
1186352 they will increasingly get members of congress for an hour or so to give them a campaign check thats a better deal for the lobbyists and will also make it more likely for corruption to happen
1186353 the balloon will be pressed and the air will come out another way
1186354 if we really want to move this country off the dime and build a modern and safe infrastructure then the business community must step up to the plate and lead

1186368 no fine imposed by this court will compensate for the familys loss but hopefully it will bring some closure
1186369 this is a classic example of how big money has inextricably intertwined the campaign advising and lobbying worlds of modern day washington with potential conflicts of interest all over the place
1186370 the various wpp businesses are purposely run independently and there is no risk of any conflict between clients
1186371 we occasionally will do things with one of the other companies
1186372 we were on top of it from the very beginning
1186373 some of us dont think every good impulse deserves a forced transfer from the taxpayers
1186374 we will work together to go after some of the big issues and big clients both domestically and internationally
1186375 there are a whole plethora of large corporations that as a knee jerk go to the big firms for representation
1186376 gives us the presence of a big firm though with a different business model
1186377 we have less money to go around and more folks who want it
1186378 we add some value to getting a farm bill passed

1186380 unlike in the past your donations to the club will not be disclosed to the public except in very limited circumstances
1186381 for the last 10 years the nfib was a difficult organization to deal with it didnt play it straight
1186382 well have to see over a period of time how it conducts itself
1186383 for anyone in government to say to a company or to individuals that i cannot meet with you is to deny them a constitutional right the right to petition their government
1186384 there really are no congressional ethics rules that bar a member or a staffer from influencing legislation in a way that would benefit their former client or employer
1186385 the issue is whether loyalty to their former employers will impact the decisions they make in their new roles

1186391 suggested earth like soil further analysis has revealed un earthlike aspects of the soil chemistry
1186392 it is a reactive compound its not usually considered an ingredient for life
1186393 this is surprising since an earlier thermal and evolved gas analyzer measurement of surface materials was consistent with but not conclusive of the presence of perchlorate
1186394 while we have not completed our process on these soil samples we have very interesting intermediate results
1186395 im very happy to announce that weve gotten an ice sample
1186396 we got a little bit of ice mixed in with this sample
1186397 the closer we get back home the stronger we are
1186398 the nra has figured out where they have a unique advantage
1186399 there would be no need to pay out that amount of money unless you needed to maintain a superlative relationship with that person after he leaves
1186400 the elements within the honest leadership and open government act that are within the house rules
1186401 i think theres an interest in making some sort of deal
1186402 but it has taken a lot of my time too much time
1186403 i dont want putting a lot of them out of work on my conscience
1186404 its a compliment to us when they want to bring sons or daughters or cousins into the business
1186405 it is simpler for a camel to go through a needles eye than for a man with much money to go into the kingdom of god

1186420 it is do with national pride it does become the first gold medal of the games
1186421 for every games there is that sense that we are presenting the nation to the world and that really has been probably since 1980 when the games started to become a big television deal
1186422 any kind of demonstration or political religious or racial propaganda in any olympic sites venues or other areas
1186423 the purpose of hosting the olympics is to prove to the chinese people that the rest of the world acknowledges the chinese communist party as legitimate leaders
1186424 i am concerned about ageing odour and know there are anti ageing odour products but have not bought them myself
1186425 japan is becoming more of a cleanliness and odourless society and the name kareishu fits right in with that trend of the times
1186426 more japanese men are becoming concerned about their smell and so the need for anti body odour products is growing
1186427 logging resulted in more than a 40 percent reduction in long term carbon compared with unlogged forests
1186428 in australia and probably globally the key principle sustaining intact ancient primary forests by virtue of their holding of carbon and species is a requirement for global ecological sustainability

1186430 may result in serious injury or death as well as damage to the crane and other property
1186431 no cranes have failed due to this issue and affected parts have been corrected or are in the process of being corrected
1186432 it would be a big deal if one of these pieces of equipment failed
1186433 i wanted the bigger one i dont want the small one
1186434 justin and i wanted our sons name to be as special as he is
1186435 it sounds like an unusual marriage at first but once you begin brawling in midways mortal kombat versus dc universe you will learn it surprisingly works
1186436 it harkens back to the days of mortal kombat ii in terms of how it controls fuel
1186437 it looks and plays like a summer block buster and wheelman looks like it has a lot of potential i love taking vin diesel behind the wheel and the studs and cut scenes were phenomenal
1186438 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think

1186445 no other transparency tool in the colorado market today provides the depth of information on the total costs of procedures as anthem care comparison
1186446 through this tool our members have access to the costs associated with all aspects of a specific medical procedure not just the cost of the procedure itself but also the costs of the entire spectrum of care from lab tests to recovery room charges these medical care cost estimates will help our members better understand the overall costs they are likely to incur before a medical service is provided
1186447 ultimately we want anthem care comparison to create well informed consumers of health care
1186448 creating well informed consumers employers physicians and hospital providers is an important element of transparency and an essential step in transforming the consumers role in their own health care
1186449 we have tried to draw the attention of the public to fraudulent tickets

1186453 citigroups tangible equity ratio is 2 if you re consolidate its off balance sheet assets that is catastrophically low the other thing that was interesting with the citigroup release was the securities and banking revenue was down 94 somehow they managed to bury in the release that the fee income and a bunch of other components that was the old salomon smith barney has fallen off the side of a cliff
1186454 its heat one bulldogs one we went from one extreme to the other today was one of the best practices weve had top to bottom since weve been here

1186460 monetary policy will continue to be appropriately tight until we see a more benign outlook and manageable inflation expectations

1186463 where does the population of gt the composition objects take place
1186464 weve been able to put our finger on the social pulse of human connectivity on a planetary scale and weve confirmed that its indeed a small world
1186465 over the next few decades new kinds of computing applications from smart networks to automated translation systems will help make the world even smaller with closer social connections and deeper understanding among people
1186466 messenger data gives us a unique opportunity to study distances in the social network
1186467 to our knowledge this is the first time a planetary scale social network has been available to validate the well known 6 degrees of separation finding
1186468 larrabee is expected to kick start an industry wide effort to create and optimize software for the dozens hundreds and thousands of cores expected to power future computers
1186469 over time the consistency of intel architecture and thus developer freedom afforded by the larrabee architecture will bring about massive innovation in many areas and market segments
1186470 the hardware guys couldnt make a chip until there was software out there we had a stalemate
1186471 think of it as a key to unlock the next era of computing the many core era
1186472 its a bit like a supercomputer on a chip really the sky is the limit in terms of what software makers can do with it
1186473 it is important for industry to work in tandem with academia to unleash the immense power of parallel computing
1186474 were quickly moving the computing industry to a many core world
1186475 to to kick start an industry wide effort to create and optimize software for the dozens hundreds and thousands of cores expected to power future computers
1186476 as co ceos greg and sanjay will build on the significant changes and solid progress achieved at motorola and the mobile devices business under gregs leadership during the last seven months

1186478 for apple it matters most that they patch the client libraries since there are so few osx recursive servers in use
1186479 the bottom line is that despite this update it appears that the client libraries still arent patched
1186480 so much seems possible at the beginning of a trip so many things seem brimmed with meaning
1186481 trickster is a boundary crosser every group has its edge its sense of in and out and trickster is always there at the gates of the city and the gates of life making sure there is commerce
1186482 the key difference between a sock puppet and a regular
1186483 it becomes apparent that the way people seek and give attention and the amount they are likely to receive is significantly shaped by their social roles and their status within the major institutional hierarchies
1186484 we bless same sex relationships and will continue to do so
1186485 the majority of english bishops believe that it has been a good conference there has been real listening and real hearing
1186486 there are no instant solutions to the big difficulties but there is a commitment to stay together and work on it
1186487 the lambeth conference is required to do something rather than live down to the worst expectations of the bishops who stayed away
1186488 we need to negotiate a separation in the communion sooner rather than later to leave the strongest possibility of remaining in some kind of fellowship
1186489 the most unhealthy thing would be to allow the debate to continue for a long time
1186490 we would have only ourselves to blame if more of the provinces go their own way
1186491 the vast majority want to take steps towards restoring communion but a smaller group base the language of communion on feelings what it means to me what can i get from it
1186492 a major question is how we move towards that point the highest degree of fellowship whilst allowing for an orderly separation
1186493 if a whole province such as the episcopal church acts contrary to gods word and the consensus of the communion who in the anglican communion has the authority to discipline that erring province
1186494 so when the archbishop of canterbury invited these american bishops to participate in the lambeth conference against the recommendations of the windsor report and the primates meeting and in the face of the unrelenting commitment of the american church to bless sinful behaviour we were stunned
1186495 over the past five years we have come to see this as a remnant of british colonialism and it is not serving us well the spiritual leadership of a global communion of independent and autonomous provinces should not be reduced to one man appointed by a secular government
1186496 st francis of assisi said preach the gospel at all times when necessary use words we believe that our absence at this lambeth conference is the only way that our voice will be heard for more than ten years we have been speaking and have not been heard so maybe our absence will speak louder than our words
1186497 how can we go to holy communion sit in bible study groups and share meals together pretending that everything is ok that we are still in fellowship with the persistent violators of biblical teaching and of lambeth resolutions
1186498 what do you mean everybody knows about roo all of you
1186499 i was absolutely gobsmacked when i realised the police had come to search my house when i saw the squad car i thought it was colleagues just popping in for a cup of tea
1186500 i saw the police car pull up and i knew the sergeant she recognized me when i answered the door she was shocked and said three times this is your house
1186501 they showed me the footage from the helicopter and i couldnt believe it they said if i hadnt been in they would have broken the door down to get in
1186502 titles such as nuts and zoo paint a picture of women as permanently lasciviously uncomplicatedly available
1186503 we should ask those who make profits out of revelling in or encouraging selfish irresponsibility among young men what they think theyre doing
1186504 they celebrate thrill seeking and instant gratification without ever allowing any thought of responsibility towards others or commitment to intrude
1186505 methods that have proved effective in the field of speech recognition
1186506 the sounds made by the bed linen when the subject moves during sleep
1186507 it is sometimes very difficult to decide where loud breathing ends and snoring starts
1186508 periods of silence are most often misclassified by the system as breaths or duvet noises similarly duvet noises are often misclassified
1186509 a snore may fade to become a breath hence a snore is not always followed by a silence a breath may develop into a snore hence a snore is not always preceded by a silence
1186510 i won mum i won student of the year for year 1 ive got a medal with my name on it everyone clapped and i had to go to the front at assembly
1186511 i hope you dont mind me disturbing you at work
1186512 this is the best phone call ive had all week its more important than anything else im so proud of you
1186513 the school still gets money for me but they send me here instead its a good place to be because i get on with everyone its like home
1186514 its the schools that have the most challenging intake that tend to want to use this sort of service
1186515 but they are often in areas of falling rolls and decreasing budgets we are sort of hit with a double whammy i have double the number of kids that i would want to send compared to the leafy suburbs of stockton but its my area thats decreasing in numbers so i have more kids and less budget
1186516 we have big round table discussions hes only a 70 attender is it worth spending the money sometimes you do chuck money at a child because you think this might be the chance to rescue a child you think it might work
1186517 i understand those concerns and i would never want us to be perceived in that way
1186518 we are a private provider although our ethos is about improving young peoples lives its doing well by doing good and we will do well eventually
1186519 clearly they cant pay it we have to help them raise money
1186520 if it werent for the funding issue we would have a lot more groups
1186521 but the model works in the four years weve been doing city amp guilds weve had a 100 pass rate and 95 of the young people are now working in the construction industry
1186522 to be honest i think even 3 500 per pupil is dear
1186523 if you take that out of your budget 10 times for 10 different students thats the cost of a good member of staff who can deliver 20 hours teaching a week to 25 or 30 students it can run away with you very easily
1186524 we buy provision at 31 a day and we are able to charge schools 18 but if we had to go back to the schools tomorrow and say its 31 most would still buy it
1186525 five years ago we used to send kids off to college and entertain them now theyre on courses with planned learning outcomes
1186526 it does still cost more but we are lucky to have the city council as a broker the real cost is probably about double what we have to pay
1186527 from time to time you may be a bit troubled and a bit too charming for your own good

1186586 i like to cut the brie into smaller pieces and mix it in the bowl some cut the brie into a single or 1 inch cube and place it in the center of each patty letting the meat sort of go all around the patty and the cheese then is in the center whichever you choose is fine

1186589 what hes doing is brilliant hes allowing the dough and other ingredients to fully soak up the liquid in this case the eggs in order to get a drier and firmer dough which bakes to a better consistency
1186590 head lice are misunderstood and get a bad press especially in schools where children can be excluded for having nits the truth is they present no serious health risk and anyone can catch them regardless of personal hygiene and social class
1186591 i want to nail the history of lice while there is good biological understanding the epidemiology and social aspects of lice are not well understood thats why i want to hear about peoples experiences and beliefs
1186592 perhaps they get confused with body lice which are associated with disease
1186593 and there is a danger of an allergic reaction to the anticoagulant they inject into your scalp to stop your blood clotting before they drink it
1186594 the best way to get rid of them is to wash the hair with conditioner and comb them out to watch a mother de lousing a childs head is to witness an almost primal grooming behaviour its very good for family bonding
1186595 and if your kids never get nits it means perhaps they dont have much direct contact with other people
1186596 were ironing out some technical issues but we may be able to start sharing attendance data with parents from september
1186597 weve got the information i guess its just a case of finding a way to get it online for parents to view with anything it related we like to hold back and see what everyone else is doing so we can learn from their mistakes we did that a few years back when attendance registers started going online and saved ourselves a lot of hassle
1186598 the first step was increasing the number of grades we send home to parents in addition to reports we now give five sets of grades for every student in every subject every half term it takes a lot of time to input all the grades i teach about 150 students im having to turn marking round ultra quick to meet tight grade deadlines my workload has definitely increased
1186599 essentially all teachers are being asked to do is keep their mark books on the school system so it shouldnt create too much extra work
1186600 we need to make sure weve got our internal processes right before we share our information with parents from september parents will be able to access their childs attendance figures online but its too early to add in reporting our it guys tell us it can be done
1186601 when i visit my gp he can pull up all my test results but it doesnt mean i can interpret them if were going to put the information out there we need to make sure parents can interpret them correctly otherwise its a pointless exercise
1186602 the whole process of the sats has been called into question surely its time for teachers to take advantage of the wave of public support and say enough is enough
1186603 youre just fine as you are but you need us to help make your contacts
1186604 i was inspired at columbia but i was not as close to the frontline of social impact as i am here serving the people directly without giving up one single inch of what it takes to be great
1186605 rethinking of the static organisational paradigms of american research universities
1186606 with such a large and diverse student population in state there is no one method of teaching that is the silver bullet so we have a huge variety in the size and style of courses and classes online teaching and seminars
1186607 i like teamwork i thrived at cornell but it was a world of super egos with everyone defined by their little world decisions took for ever here we are large but our style is nimble
1186608 all these kids should succeed here if we can be creative enough and if they want to learn then the onus is on us if we admit a student who has demonstrated the potential to succeed and they fail then its our failure
1186609 i had links with asu through my work in australia then i discovered it had become this extraordinary institution that transcended traditional subject barriers and that was key for me
1186610 its very applied or what we like to call use inspired research on an industrial model we have taken on 700 new researchers in the last five years
1186611 they offered me a full grant i could have gone to the ivy league but i would have graduated with 100 000 of debt now i can save that for postgraduate study
1186612 we are trying to eliminate hierarchies in the aim for both public access and excellence and continually to ask what is a public university its an institution built on who we include rather than who we exclude
1186613 east grampians health service will this financial year receive 5 89 million more than what it was given in 1999 2000 mr andrews said
1186614 the brumby government is taking action to deliver quality health services for all victorians
1186615 record funding enables east grampians health service to treat record numbers of patients whether its emergency procedures elective surgery or other vital health services
1186616 however until a detailed analysis is undertaken we are unable to determine what component applies for funding to accommodate recent enterprise bargaining agreement wage increases and cpi and what if any is available for growth in service mr davies said
1186617 hospital budgets are now in the black and more than 60 hospitals and aged care facilities have been rebuilt or upgraded as part of our capital works program mr andrews said
1186618 we are turning around our health system by significantly increasing hospital budgets so that patients get the support and treatment they need close to home
1186619 this will give east grampians health service the resources it needs to continue its first class work in treating patients he said
1186620 to the best of his knowledge was still of that faith
1186621 they think a combination of those things will lure a certain number of research productive western faculty
1186622 my sense is that the understanding here of what these students are all about continues to be pretty limited
1186623 the thing that really resonated with people here was that this could have a really positive impact on saudi society over the years and decade to come
1186624 then certainly youll see individual faculty making decisions about that matter with their feet at an official level too i think youd see the university pulling the plug
1186625 the only juvenile establishment that this inspectorate has assessed as performing well
1186626 this is a model that should be built on not abandoned
1186627 to close thorn cross largely for immediate financial reasons is both disappointing and retrograde
1186628 currently there is no obvious impact on apprenticeship start figures which continue to grow strongly
1186629 the situation in the bigger infrastructure projects for example building schools hospitals railways and roads is still ok
1186630 despite the economic problems we should be trying to preserve these skills
1186631 they would be very easy to lose and would take years to rebuild
1186632 ofsted have exposed the fact that many of the apprenticeships created by labour are virtual
1186633 the government has almost trebled the number of apprenticeships in the past decade the lsc is confident that by continuing to invest in apprenticeships employers will be helping to safeguard the future skills requirements and prosperity of their businesses
1186634 im worried about how im going to deal with the paperwork
1186635 god im so glad im not where you guys are
1186636 ive just read about this andrew at last theres a real pathway theres a real way out of hell for the aboriginal people which we see up and down our northern territory kimberley and queensland cattle stations which are stuck in these communities on welfare without jobs or any meaningful future
1186637 from the highest in the land to the employers of two or three people only the question to me is how can i help im gratified by that and i believe this is now an idea of australian employers not of mine of australian employers whose time has come my direct appeal is for every employer in australia when the government delivers and when the aboriginal leaders and the aboriginals themselves deliver work mentor ready aboriginal people to you to employ we ask you to step out to your major role your major part in breaking at last the aboriginal social and monetary poverty cycle and employ these aboriginals
1186638 the devil of training is boredom a three to four month short course which is crammed with the industry details specific to that aboriginals future job is what has always been required and what the government is promising to deliver
1186639 the biggest challenge is that most aboriginal peoples numeracy and literacy levels arent that good and arent sufficient to be able to do the general mine training courses we need a lot of pre training to get people ready to join the mining industry or any kind of industry we need to have a longer term target than two years i think we need to establish cradle to grave strategies for employment and training we need to start focusing children as young as grade two and ensure that they are starting to establish the basic foundations in numeracy and literacy
1186640 a welfare only response to these communities is precisely the wrong way to go
1186641 weve got to get housing right weve got to get education right weve got to get health right but weve also got to get jobs right and thats where corporate australia comes in and i look forward very much to partnering with our major australian corporations in what is their initiative
1186642 ive hung around corporate australia for a number of years ive heard a lot of goodwill from people but ive never been actually sure about whether those doors are openable from the outside andrew forrest assures me and im sure hes correct about this that these doors are there for the opening
1186643 whether youre in aurukun or youre in hopedale youre out in the sticks we can do the welfare reform to push our people into real work but the bit i could not ever muscle together was the work opportunity part of the jigsaw and so it was a complete hit to the solar plexus when andrew proposed not a few thousand real jobs in a timeframe but 50 000 guaranteed real jobs
1186644 50 000 indigenous jobs in two years a lead from corporate australia
1186645 more than 1 86 million people in alabama 46 1 of the states population will be damned to hell if they dont have a born again experience professing jesus christ as their savior according to a report by southern baptist researchers
1186646 i feel sorry for them you go into a mainstream lesson and its interesting
1186647 its not just breaking the news to the school its making sure staff and pupils can receive counselling and dealing with everything else
1186648 i look at my area and what i can do within the school fences is limited we have had a number of knife crime incidences in the borough it saddens me that there isnt a sense of community any more
1186649 there is a different edict coming out of government every day and theres no clarity i have heard that if a young person is found carrying a knife they are put in prison other reports say this isnt the case which is it
1186650 i have youngsters who have friends who are victims of knife crime as a headteacher i need to know how to support these young people we need to give them time to talk if they want to but if you go in heavy handed you are just going to alienate politicians preaching isnt going to make any difference
1186651 they empower the children by telling them that they have a choice but they also told them what prison was like they talked to them in a direct manner and in their register
1186652 i want to become a social worker so i can stop other girls going through what i went through
1186653 fgm female genital mutilation is not taken seriously enough here people really dont believe that its going on
1186654 one morning my uncle just woke me up and took me to the house of a woman i didnt know they tied my hands blindfolded me and took off my pants i was tall and i was fighting but the woman sat on my chest i couldnt scream they put a cloth in my mouth it felt like i was suffocating
1186655 i had to keep asking my teacher if i could go to the bathroom and my classmates couldnt understand why i got so upset sometimes i was always getting infections and my period was so painful that i had to take time off every month
1186656 people are naturally afraid to raise the subject and if theyre not informed then it becomes even more difficult
1186657 most families are receptive to conversation its how you approach them that matters talk to them about their holiday say that you understand members of their community practise circumcision fgm and let them know what the law is
1186658 teachers tell us theyre worried about being seen as racist but they have a statutory responsibility to safeguard children and protect their welfare
1186659 we know that fgm can be seen as an act of love for children we know that some parents would like to say no to fgm but feel under pressure were more interested in the perpetrators making money from this practice than the parents
1186660 like most cases of child abuse we have to rely on a child telling on their parent or in some cases their whole community there may be fears of authority language or immigration issues in some cases hard to reach communities may not even know the law
1186661 death threats were sent to my house and i wasnt welcome in certain parties i dont want to vilify my community but as a woman i want the freedom to celebrate my femininity its very difficult to communicate this message
1186662 it took me three years to tell anyone what happened
1186663 i tell my story so that no one else has to go through it but im scared someone will attack me because im a disgrace
1186664 teachers should speak out if i heard about any of these cases id be the first one to tell the police
1186665 we were set up to be the voice of the learner to throw light on the system to look honestly and independently in a very transparent way at what happens in qualifications and tests and where there are issues of confidence to make an appropriate response to that to intervene and investigate to bring a greater transparency into the system and protect the main consumer the learner
1186666 if you ask me right now whats going to determine whether people have got confidence in the exam system its actually about whether ofqual can get enough independence and a broad enough remit to hold all the levers of control over the long run
1186667 as its presented at the moment it could have the opposite effect
1186668 on any given day in the middle of any given debate about standards you can discover that ofqual is the one body that cant stand up and speak with any authority because most of what it is accounting for is other peoples decisions im seriously worried by it
1186669 i remember kenneth baker decreeing the date history came to an end as far as school study was concerned
1186670 its very difficult to see why politicians get involved they get the blame when something goes wrong and it doesnt do the education system any favours with all these constant changes
1186671 it seems to me that what the government has recognised through the creation of ofqual is the need to have an independent voice a voice that doesnt actually report to government the government is not in control of ofqual this is a voice that will report to parliament and therefore ministers will be at a remove from what ofqual is actually doing and i think that is a good recognition on the part of government that you do need to have independence in any system and not give the impression that ministers are involved in every aspect of the work
1186672 qca can speak for itself on the question of ofqual it does come back to getting the legislation right to our own officials liaising with the department to ensure it does give the regulator the teeth to be able to bite if it has to bite
1186673 i would observe that in every country in the world testing is a matter of interest for government because it is a way of getting into the standards debate
1186674 at this point in time i am not concerned in a few months time if i find were going to be constrained yes i would be concerned obviously that would prompt further discussion before we get to the point where legislation goes through parliament at this stage i am sure that people are working together to ensure that the legislation is sufficiently enabling for ofqual to be able to do a good job
1186675 one of them rests with the number of initiatives that come on stream at any one time the risk is very much one which will be there in schools that are delivering change in the end whatever ministers say whatever ofqual says whatever qca says the teacher remains the final arbiter thats where it rests the biggest risk is that people are not well prepared for the changes and that theres not buy in for the changes
1186676 theres always a risky moment at the very beginning when new systems start up things can always go wrong and theres a point when people are the most critical part of the system go back to 1988 and gcses go back to 2000 and the changes to a levels go back to other qualifications that have come on stream those are the most critical points to get established
1186677 sometimes with the best will in the world you manage a risk and it still goes pear shaped but all i can say at this moment is that i do not expect there to be the sort of problem that occurred in 2002
1186678 at the most basic level students are encouraged to make judgments about which one they like best more able students might be able to have a discussion about what the image might mean
1186679 i like to think its giving students an insight into things they wouldnt necessarily think about
1186680 there was a photograph of a classroom in china that provoked a lot of discussion it was in a cave the students couldnt believe that
1186681 ive used the international pictures for teaching development i used one of a train in thailand coming down a track that cuts right through a market it leads into so many issues urbanisation trade employment even the question of what development actually is
1186682 ive used them on my think about it board for all sorts of areas including environmental issues
1186683 they have really opened my childrens eyes to the wider world
1186684 sometimes theyre sad but it makes you realise what the worlds like
1186685 its a chance to share our success with the town
1186686 but its really the university which is showing off we want to make the connection with the town stronger and encourage future undergraduates
1186687 even among drama school students when you ask people what theyd like to do after graduation some answer that they want to be famous its a big problem in the industry that those reality shows make it seem as if being an actor is easy and that you dont need the training but if youre going to survive then being properly trained is crucial not just in acting technique but also in the techniques of getting a job building a career and surviving in the longer term lots of young actors are no longer in the profession just six months or a year after leaving training they may be very good actors but they havent got the skills to survive the harsh realities drama schools need to teach those skills too
1186688 we do offer degrees in acting and rose bruford was one of the first drama schools to go down that route which has subsequently become the norm
1186689 we see no reason why our degrees shouldnt have the same kudos and respectability as a degree in engineering
1186690 at showcases people are looking at the person in front of them not the degree theyve got
1186691 we are going to produce actors who dont just service the industry like puppets but also help to change it
1186692 brings together a university training that produces performers with a capital p with the skills based training of drama schools that produces actors with a capital a
1186693 when ive worked with university trained actors they sometimes lack basic skills but sometimes when you are working with drama school trained actors you become aware that theyve never been in a devised show and dont know how to work in that context
1186694 there is now a real tension about the way actors are being trained because the industry has entered a new era actors cant just act any more if they want to work they have to be entrepreneurial they have to make work build companies and find spaces for that work the graduates from universities are good at this they are able to make context for the work not just work itself
1186695 its as if the entire training is geared to that one night and getting an agent when what we need to know is how the business really works and how we can make it work for us it feels as if were being trained like soldiers to fight a war i sometimes feel as if ive spent three years being trained to be directed rather than to think for myself in hindsight i can perhaps see the benefit of university
1186696 training an actor is as intensive as training a doctor of course we all value doctors but perhaps we also have to value what artists bring to society too and fund their training properly its a leap of faith and we have to take it
1186697 it is if thats all you bring to the table
1186698 im going to beat myself in the head with this until i hurt too badly to function
1186699 where do i learn how to become a freelance writer
1186700 after all im the kind of idiot who has to touch the hot plate after the server brings the dish and warns me that its hot
1186701 teen choice awards teens love gossip girl and hannah montana
1186702 every student deserves to return to school with the tools they need to succeed and the office depot foundation is doing a great thing to make that happen for so many kids who might not otherwise have the necessary resources
1186703 thank you all again for your corporate consciousness and commitment to many children and families in need across the land
1186704 by placing backpacks containing essential school supplies into the hands of children we are giving them important tools they need to start school with confidence
1186705 we have a planet to save we have an economy to grow
1186706 and we can do that if we keep our balance in all of this and not just say but for drilling in unprotected and these protected areas offshore we would have lower gas prices

1186709 if we do anything we would want to make sure all the students at uw think this is adding to it and not taking away
1186710 i dont want to put more investments in the madison municipal building until i have an answer to this question
1186711 theres a lot of split opinions on the whole thing
1186712 the hotels in the downtown vicinity would probably have the most to gain
1186713 now big oils filling john mccains campaign with two million dollars in contributions
1186714 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1186715 barack obamas latest negative attack ad shows his celebrity is matched only by his hypocrisy
1186716 after all it was senator obama not john mccain who voted for the bush cheney energy bill that was a sweetheart deal for oil companies
1186717 this addiction is one of the most dangerous and urgent threats this nation has ever faced
1186718 in 10 years we will eliminate the need for oil from the entire middle east and venezuela
1186719 the secretary of state wants to raise the public profile of further education
1186720 therell be a programme of events to bring the sector into the sunlit uplands of public awareness
1186721 most people think that pathology is about doing post mortems were trying to educate the public that there are other branches to it
1186722 the ideal lead time for a week would be a year
1186723 you respect other organisations and you hope they wont clash with yours
1186724 i think the plan commission and village board havent rejected it out of hand
1186725 its a larger amount but there are many questions we havent got to answering yet its an opportunity but it has to be done properly
1186726 it just needs to be planned in a different way
1186727 we are going through the village at a very slow pace
1186728 the condo market being what it is obviously gave us reason not to push the project as fast as wed like it to be
1186729 well review their child welfare practices while the child was in their care and custody
1186730 state and federal privacy law prohibits us from commenting further but we will work to be helpful to state reviewers of this ohio case
1186731 remedied the risks that initially caused the child to be removed
1186732 we will issue a report to the county based on our findings
1186733 thats why im a democrat i can make the democratic voters think whatever i want them to
1186734 this comes from two sources and of course there is a creative tension between these objectives
1186735 while a new brand name is a liability in an advertising program its an asset in a pr program
1186736 the real barrier is the human mind it normally takes decades to build a brand because it takes decades to penetrate the gray matter in between your ears
1186737 successful brands get into the mind slowly a blurb in a magazine a mention in a newspaper a comment from a friend a display in a retail store after a slow publicity buildup people become convinced that they have known about the brand forever pg 228
1186738 if youre not worried wheres the worry coming from im not worried and youre not worried
1186739 provide faster feedback to markers and remove the potential for losing pupils scripts in the postal system
1186740 difficulties with the new marker systems caused further delays to marking and the capture of results
1186741 we are aware that the introduction of new it based improvements must carry risks but we have mitigation plans to ensure delivery is secure
1186742 online systems although they confer many benefits are also subject to risk when first introduced
1186743 the fixers celebrated efficiency is of little help when inhabitants of globals sealed biosphere began devolving and display characteristics of ancient life forms
1186744 we would have searched in a total probably around about the 20 square kilometres
1186745 were assuming that this person still is on foot were hoping that hes not injured in any way because that does obviously has a fairly big impact on his wellbeing
1186746 so what were trying to do is just make sure that we cover as much territory as carefully as possible to increase the chances of locating him safe and well
1186747 today weve got the surf lifesaving queensland helicopter on scene it arrived up there at 7 oclock this morning
1186748 its going to utilise its thermal imaging equipment just to run some low level flights up the creek beds and into the areas where we think he might be just to hopefully pick up some body warmth
1186749 the people who are locals around there say its some of the toughest terrain to encounter for bushwalkers and thats sometimes why the attraction is for people to go to that area
1186750 our main concern is that hes become ill or that hes become injured and then that makes it difficult for us in particular with the industrial deafness that he cant hear the searchers and they could be close by
1186751 we lost everything here about 60 acres worth here were on our own
1186752 does not operate as a single organisation where knowledge and experience flow instinctively between its teams and functions it works in silos
1186753 faced with the merger of two further education institutions how do i find out who has done this before
1186754 competition can be healthy but failure to adopt good practice where this exists is foolish
1186755 many organisations find it difficult to embed knowledge management into their operational practices and for this reason the lsc commissioned tfpl to help us understand our strengths and weakness in this area
1186756 as the report shows while there are a range of views across the organisation as to how well we have embedded our approach to knowledge management into our everyday practices there is a common desire to improve
1186757 i just dont like quotas in the boardroom or in the office winning companies are meritocracies they practice differentiation making a clear distinction between top middle and bottom performers this system is candid and fair and its the most effective way for an organization to field the best team
1186758 the promise of capitalism is that if you work hard you can make your boss rich
1186759 but you cant have different pay systems for all your individuals
1186760 i want to kick name removed until he is dead cos he is a crap lecturer
1186761 but subject name removed is hopeless no past exam paper no help crap lecturer no lecture notes no book just his notes from class
1186762 name removed is a terrible fat stupid lecturer he thinks he is great but marxism is as last century as his smelly dirty donkey jacket
1186763 i dont even have a f ing clue who this lecturer is who the f is he
1186764 social networking sites such as bebo and facebook are like e zines in that they publish about ones own obsession and daily life it is no surprise since they discuss their daily life that they also discuss their university life including lecturers and professors
1186765 in doing this there is nothing new it is just that before this these discussions took place in cafes and bars and were face to face
1186766 students might argue that social networking sites are about freedom of expression and i am sympathetic to that but they need to be aware of how the publishing of their opinions impacts on things
1186767 it is part of a bigger question about the consumer rights of students towards their university education
1186768 students believe that bebo is our site our space to do what we wish to do and they see commercial companies accessing bebo as being invaded it is an arena of contest
1186769 of course the state universities and commercial organisation are using social networking sites to access young people and of course social networking sites are actually run by commercial companies and are a commercial space which has been colonised by students
1186770 they should understand it cuts both ways and they should see the small print that the outside world peers inside the subculture to observe what theyre doing
1186771 in a more benign way it is important that students contribute to their education but when you bring in the emotive which you often see on social networking sites you move away from the rational enlightenment idea of free speech the member of staff also has no real right of reply since if they did contribute to the site then it could result in angry exchanges
1186772 in the extreme this could be cyber bullying or harassment of their staff i would expect a university to stand up for their staff for the university it is also about reputation management
1186773 if students have real concerns about their lecturers they would be better off going through the proper channels rather than posting on a website we believe that all staff and students have the right to work free from intimidation online or otherwise universities need to ensure that they seek full consultation with the unions regarding any policies they wish to produce in this area
1186774 is this taking place because there are not procedures or facilities for these conversations to take place between staff and students are the procedures perceived as lip service or over bureaucratic by the students
1186775 the 1 per cent fall in retail sales in june seems to be the first swallow of the recession we cant avoid
1186776 a recession is inevitable because the boom times of the last 15 years were almost entirely driven by spending borrowed money
1186777 australia has become addicted to debt and just like a drug it took rising amounts of debt over time to sustain the illusion of prosperity
1186778 in 2000 private debt rose by 59 billion and that financed 9 per cent of aggregate demand
1186779 in 2007 it rose by 260 billion and was responsible for 19 per cent of demand
1186780 now debt has stopped rising and just like a drug addict again the australian economy has to go cold turkey on debt
1186781 given how i criticised them for raising rates too quickly in response to every minor movement in inflation it would be churlish of me to call for them to drop rates at the very first sign of a downturn
1186782 head like a hole black as your soul id rather die than give you control head like a hole black as your soul id rather die than give you control bow down before the one you serve youre going to get what you deserve
1186783 educators who are making a positive difference to their peers or communities
1186784 this is not about ticking boxes its about giving these women the equipment they need to break free of abusive relationships but they have to take the initiative
1186785 manage being hit because that usually did not last long
1186786 at some point in the course a light will go on inside a womans head and she will see that she no longer has to put up with the abuse that is a very powerful moment
1186787 is that rather than just being a spokesperson or marketing device for the mcdonalds corporation ronald performs an important transformational leadership function
1186788 while ronald is crafted by the actual leaders of mcdonalds his leadership exceeds official corporate narratives because of the cultural meanings associated with his character as a clown
1186789 since 2003 ronald has held the quasi formal executive position of chief happiness officer and on 16 april 2004 he became the ambassador for an active lifestyle
1186790 mcdonalds corporate executives believed ronald could do more than just be a figurehead spokesclown at high profile public relations stunts such as delivering happy meals to the united nations the russian philosopher mikhail bakhtins words apply to ronald there always remains in him unrealised potential and unrealised demands
1186791 our analysis suggests that a new category of leader is needed something called a clown leader
1186792 there is much reason to be sceptical about new forms of leadership that might enhance corporate power in a way that creates new forms of authoritarianism whose operations are far from transparent this is even more salient for leadership such as ronalds whose influence might not easily be noticed given his fictional character
1186793 i sometimes think im very lucky that i had experience as a lecturer because things like standing up now in a lecture theatre in front of 100 people arent going to bother me
1186794 in a lot of ways the audiences i get now are less difficult than your 18 and 19 year olds with their baseball caps pulled down texting each other on the back row
1186795 at least my audiences now are far more with me
1186796 what my years as a lecturer told me is that you have to win your audience over you cant take them for granted so i do enjoy public readings but i am lucky that i have this experience to draw on i know other writers find it far more frightening than i do
1186797 ive always been writing i wrote my first poem when i was four and ive always been secretly scribbling on the side
1186798 ive always had this other secret life on the go essentially as an unsuccessful writer because i was never published i just kept on going
1186799 i was thinking ive got a few years to go and that ive had all this time trying to write and not getting published part of me was being a bit arrogant and thinking i knew it all anyway and a part of me thinking well theres nothing to lose and ive already done excel spreadsheets and ive already done build your own website i wasnt very good at that so why not have a go at creative writing
1186800 theres always somebody having a go its a very nice thing to do
1186801 actually if youre a teacher the one thing that is really wonderful is to be taught by somebody else and to just sit back and relax and let everybody else have all the pain and in fact the course ran on a wednesday afternoon which would normally be when we had our departmental meetings so it was just wonderful to be able to sneak off and say look im very sorry but im going to my staff development programme now
1186802 i felt very sorry for them because at the best of times im quite bossy but they did terribly well i had very distinguished teachers sean obrien the poet who won the ts eliot prize recently and jane rogers the novelist who was really very helpful and inspiring
1186803 one of the tutors phoned me and said do you mind if i give your phone number to bill hamilton hes the external examiner and a literary agent
1186804 and i felt oh my goodness so there was this terribly nerve racking interlude between her giving him my phone number and him actually ringing me and then when he rang me the rest of it happened very quickly it was an almost overnight transformation after years of having been unpublished
1186805 i think one of the very important things that happened on the course was that i realised it wasnt going to be a memoir but a work of fiction
1186806 it gave me the confidence to do that really because like a lot of academics i had a terrible fear of straying away from the truth and in fact being able to abandon the truth and get stuck into the realms of fiction really makes a different kind of truth possible
1186807 but having agreed to go along with my decision she gave me the most excellent piece of advice which was if you are going to call it that you have to make tractors a bigger theme in the book and so it was very much on her advice that i developed a story within a story that was very helpful
1186808 at the end of the war under the churchill stalin pact those who were born east of a certain line were sent back and those who were born west of it were allowed to stay by a fluke really my family were allowed to stay
1186809 ive just come back from kent where the farmers have been complaining theyll still have poles romanians and bulgarians but they might find that the poles by and large dont want to do that kind of very menial work and want to save up and go home whereas for the ukrainians it was more of a travelling break really it was seasonal work and ukraine is such a deeply agricultural country that they make very good farm workers they just know how to do it its in the blood
1186810 i always knew that my higher education career was doomed to failure because i could never bring myself to do research and to publish academic articles somehow whenever i sat down with an intention to write something serious and intelligent my eyes would glaze over and a few minutes later i would find myself tapping away at something completely different
1186811 i love teaching and contact with the students and this is one of the things i miss now but what i dont miss are the endless hours of meetings which seemed at the time to be utterly pointless in retrospect i cant remember what they were about at all i also miss my colleagues writing is a very lonely business
1186812 i am now only 0 25 on the staff i have a quarter of the post
1186813 normally that would be research leave but funnily enough my novels go into the research assessment exercise so to that extent its permissible
1186814 it was in a way a very topical subject for 1968 but i got distracted by everything else that was going on around me and im afraid that the phd remains unfinished
1186815 it was very new very exciting i was living in a commune in the east end of london and experimenting with alternative lifestyles
1186816 something like chiding latecomers or teasing people who have left their mobile phones on you know the sort of thing
1186817 reform and re license the uk network of 25 sector skills councils
1186818 is she living on the streets how is she feeding and clothing herself how is she getting money you hear so many horror stories
1186819 we have more data on missing cars than we have on missing children
1186820 without a national reporting system we have no idea whether the number of missing children is going up or down
1186821 what we need is a central collation of data so we can measure trends over time or make comparisons between geographical areas without this its difficult to tell how effective we are being or whether government policies are working
1186822 i realised there were differences in the way data on missing children was recorded between different police forces in some cases the police force and local authority werent covering the same geographical area so things were slipping through the net
1186823 we need to know what happens when a child goes missing
1186824 how do police assess the risk to the child what decisions are taken as a result
1186825 where there is help young people may need help to access it
1186826 for years the government have turned a blind eye to the issue of missing children in my sisters case the police were too slow with better data and police forces working together i think more children could be found
1186827 its a first for us not to be out on monday but wed like assure readers that theres no problem wed like to advise readers that itll be worth the wait we have a few surprises in store
1186828 we have a clear strategy and a strong balance sheet
1186829 it is very difficult to predict how the current market will play out and the full extent of its impact on the economy
1186830 in the meantime it will continue to be difficult for all of us in the industry
1186831 in new zealand the short term market continues to look challenging and this has obviously not been helped by the investment market volatility
1186832 however we remain confident that over the longer term the policy initiatives take by the government should bear fruit
1186833 at the moment we remain on track to deliver our asia 6 program
1186834 terrorattackerna aldrig kunnat genomf ras utan m jligheten att transportera ledarna f re under och efter attackerna och ge dem m jlighet att forts tta d dandet n sta dag
1186835 there are also recommendations made against the director of surgery dr almehdi who is currently overseas
1186836 the third person involved that will require further investigation by queensland health and or the medical board was the former executive director of medical services dr margetts
1186837 that was the big gap that occurred in his transference from victoria to queensland in the first place
1186838 that the college of surgeons although that they knew there were concerns about khalifallas performance didnt pass that information on in a timely way
1186839 we certainly are very willing to sit down with queensland health and consider how this could potentially be used
1186840 but we would see it as a relatively blunt instrument and it certainly shouldnt be a substitute for sophisticated error reporting systems
1186841 it would be far better to have excellent clinical audit systems that do not rely on subjective impressions
1186842 particularly when you may well have a small hospital with only one doctor wheres the other doctor to dob them in wheres the other doctor who has the expertise perhaps to judge your area of competency
1186843 my mum couldnt afford to send me to after school theatre clubs so ive had to get all my performance experience at school i cant sing so ive been waiting years for them to do something that isnt a musical
1186844 i knew i wanted to be part of connections next year
1186845 i want to be an actor so i thought that rather than not do connections i could direct it myself that way i could give myself a part and get some more experience on stage
1186846 i chose to do a play by nigel williams called my face
1186847 it only had eight parts which i thought would be more manageable than one of the plays for 30 actors but id never run an audition i didnt know what to do i just made them kiss each other so that we could get that out of the way
1186848 find the reality of the characters and pick up the speed
1186849 and its a real national theatre rehearsal room not just some cupboard
1186850 trying to direct them and trying to be their friend its hard to keep that going
1186851 its been tough to get over that feeling of you cant tell me what to do were the same age
1186852 ollys managed to get us to the national but whether or not we pull it off on stage is up to us
1186853 getting to the connections festival is more of an achievement if youre a school the youth theatres have loads of expertise and support but if youre a school its just you your teachers and your monday night rehearsals
1186854 competition makes everybody better so it should be a great fall camp
1186855 the faster timing throws you off a bit and it is not real smooth after that so i just need to practice and get more reps in i have to have better days
1186856 my form was a little off coach grant came over and worked with me and i was able to get back into the groove a little at the end
1186857 thats not hard to see but with justin coming mitch payne has improved i think his accuracy is impressive so i dont expect it to be an easy decision
1186858 what i can speak to in just watching the returners and the punters and kickers in pre practice on saturday is santiago looks the healthiest he has ever been
1186859 the ball was jumping off his leg with more power than ive ever seen it
1186860 when you consider that now if you kick the ball out of bounds the ball is going to the 40 yard line if justin sorensen or mitch payne can kick the ball out of the end zone where there is no return thats possibly a discrepancy of 20 yards and i am not sure you can place a high enough value on that
1186861 here is why you shouldnt dismiss outright self published efforts this is one of the most enjoyable celebrity dates ordinary gal romances that ive read in quite a while well written featuring a pretty smart heroine and very entertaining whats not to love
1186862 married to a rock star is an interesting contemporary romance in that the heroine for once behaves like a sensible woman instead of a typical romance heroine clich in
1186863 while this may be a self published effort i have to say that it is pretty professionally written and therefore very easy to read i have a great time reading this story especially when it doesnt follow the same old route for stories of its kind and it also features some pretty intelligent drama taking place within its pages
1186864 our tourists who previously chose to vacation at home in order to economise now go abroad for the same purpose

1186892 financial firms are just 52 330 job cuts away from breaking last years record total
1186893 transportation cuts in 2008 have been dominated by airlines which are reeling from higher fuel prices and are cutting flights amenities and workers to offset their costs
1186894 at the same time many cash strapped americans are increasingly frustrated by higher ticket prices baggage fees airport delays and cancelled flights and are simply forgoing vacations that require air travel and staying closer to home
1186895 we have seen job cuts increase in the majority of industries that we track
1186896 the outlook for the near term remains highly challenging with significant uncertainty
1186897 globally consumer confidence is declining and despite the short term success of the recent fiscal stimulus the u s economy continues to be weak driven by continuing housing market difficulties
1186898 unacceptably high headline inflation has heightened the fomcs concerns about inflation but continuing strains in the financial markets and evidence of spreading economic softness will force the fomc to toe a fine line between the two risks

1186986 making a prediction barack obama will announce his vice presidential choice wednesday morning it will be indiana senator
1186987 t he press has been told to plan on staying until wednesday afternoon evening
1186988 o ne more clue that obama is likely to announce this week both william kristol are reporting essentially the same thing that the mccain vp pick is most likely going to come not only after obama announces his pick is but actually after obama accepts the nomination on thursday august 28 all the better to blunt the impact of the democratic convention that doesnt give him much of a window though since the republican convention starts that following monday seems to me the only reason for obama to wait past this week and announce during the olympics is to gain some advantage by letting mccain go first doesnt look like thats going to happen

1187025 this study will expand on two successful animal studies of rabicide i performed previously by the government of vietnam
1187026 in those prior studies we achieved a 25 to 30 survival rate in animals that had already developed rabies we believe this strong survival rate is a historical first achievement for any post infection rabies treatment
1187027 collaborating with cdc in designing and conducting these studies is an important step forward
1187028 if the current studies are successful we anticipate that this will be instrumental in helping our anti rabies nanoviricide towards drug approval and widespread use across the world

1187032 previous research has shown that stroke patients who were depressed did not regain function as well as other patients and they had a higher risk of dying all patients who have suffered a stroke are now screened for depression but this is not the case for patients at any stage of cancer
1187033 we know that a patients mental state affects their physical state but not enough is known about why this happens we believe that when someone is depressed they lose motivation and therefore the will to live
1187034 depression affects 25 of patients with advanced cancer but at this stage it is difficult to diagnose whilst patients with advanced cancer are clearly very ill they can still be effectively treated for depression but the first step in the treatment is the recognition that the patient is depressed
1187035 women diagnosed with breast cancer face an uphill emotional battle
1187036 at a time when they are forced to deal with their own vulnerabilities women with breast cancer must also navigate the vulnerabilities of loved ones as they react to the news
1187037 women who limit their emotions in discussing their breast cancer diagnosis often limit the possibilities for support they can receive

1187052 i feel like what happened was a blessing in disguise
1187053 this is something i think has brought this team closer together you may think i sound crazy for saying that but i really think this is bigger than me and steve
1187054 i think that was a big step for this team to accomplish the goals we wanted to accomplish
1187055 because i felt like if i didnt forgive him then it would divide the team up and we could pretty much throw this season away
1187056 he expects to catch every ball and i expect to defend every ball
1187057 when you have those two types of individuals something has to give when its 100 degrees out there and youre tired and youre frustrated sometimes emotions get involved
1187058 im sure if he had a calmer head he would have made better decisions i dont fault him for that there are times where i may want to hit somebody but i control myself i tell some of my other teammates you have to learn to keep your composure typically people do crazy things they regret when theyre emotional i think he just got too emotional at the time
1187059 lucs a standup guy and i commend him for everything hes done in this whole ordeal
1187060 and were behind steve hes still one of ours i have a daughter and if she does something that i dont like of course im going to be mad but at the end of the day shes still my daughter and im still going to love her hes still part of this team and hes still our family so were still behind him

1187104 what is the nature of true religion and what practices actually please god
1187105 where have i been guilty of that in the past where am i guilty of that now
1187106 no thats not a typo in the title yes i know that needs
1187107 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
1187108 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
1187109 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
1187110 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
1187111 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
1187112 why is he laying down in the water ugh water there must be something good there i dont see anything but hes in the water no one would put their belly in the water for fun i still dont see anything i give up this dog is weird
1187113 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
1187114 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
1187115 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
1187116 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
1187117 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
1187118 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
1187119 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
1187120 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
1187121 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
1187122 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
1187123 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
1187124 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
1187125 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
1187126 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill

1187133 oh my life is way more complicated than that just love god ive got lots more stuff to do than that

1187136 would not directly infringe plaintiffs exclusive rights to reproduce and publicly perform their copyrighted works
1187137 cable operators would no longer need to provide a unique piece of hardware for each individual subscriber in order to offer dvr functionality
1187138 this is a tremendous victory for consumers which will allow us to make dvrs available to many more people faster and less expensively than would otherwise be possible
1187139 we appreciate the courts perspective that from the standpoint of existing copyright law remote storage dvrs are the same as the traditional dvrs that are in use today

1187147 it is a great opportunity for fashion brands to get involved in something quite big and heroic
1187148 more and more we are seeing fashion brands getting involved in sports like the olympics or wimbledon or the
1187149 all young people want to these clothes because they are beautiful and very fashionable even some older people like to wear them
1187150 with the olympics everyone wants to look sporty as this is the biggest event ever for us and we all want to be supportive
1187151 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
1187152 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
1187153 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
1187154 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
1187155 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
1187156 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
1187157 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

1187161 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
1187162 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
1187163 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
1187164 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
1187165 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
1187166 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
1187167 keseksaan atas setiap seksa bagi siapa yang meninggalkan anak pinaknya dalam kebaikan tetapi dia bertemu dengan tuhannya dalam keburukan
1187168 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
1187169 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
1187170 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
1187171 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
1187172 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
1187173 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that

1187175 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba

1187177 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
1187178 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
1187179 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
1187180 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
1187181 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
1187182 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
1187183 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
1187184 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
1187185 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
1187186 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
1187187 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
1187188 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
1187189 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
1187190 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
1187191 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
1187192 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
1187193 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

1187234 hemos llegado hasta la cumbre norte no hasta la principal se era nuestro objetivo pero despu s de doce horas escalando ininterrumpidamente y cuando digo escalar me refiero al sentido literal de la palabra llegamos a la cima norte a las cuatro de la tarde y seguir hasta la principal era tentar mucho la suerte el cansancio acumulado y la hora que era nos llev a tomar la decisi n de forma un nime fue una pena pero era la nica decisi n posible la cumbre principal se ve a cerca y el terreno no parec a muy complicado pero era tarde y est bamos muy justos de fuerzas un vivac hubiese sido inevitable y sus consecuencias imprevisibles en el estado en el que est bamos

1187240 but now when you see new characters come to the show and you see those actors struggle with it you realize how its become part of your life so i dont find it tough any more
1187241 it gave me a skill set where you say well what else can this do
1187242 if you obey the rules and design a creature based on biology or something that did exist then people go oooh that looks real
1187243 its a fantastic relief not to have to worry about the length of their teeth and the size of nostril hair
1187244 so i could add an extra sabre tooth to the gorgonopsid and no one cared because this is drama
1187245 when effects step out of the background and become an active participant among the characters that changes the dynamic alters the drama that gives you something audiences hadnt seen before
1187246 if you look at space operas they show flying machines and occasionally people walk on in a pair of rubber ears personally i think the age of rubber ears is over what you need to do is to produce believable digital characters
1187247 because i can stick as many monsters in front of you as i like but unless you fell for the characters the team you would not be interested

1187259 our biggest concerns right now are power outages and street flooding said mark sloan emergency management coordinator for harris county
1187260 youve got to say right heres the line in the sand were going to stop it here because its madness to continue
1187261 it doesnt paint a very good picture of the future for carbon emissions but there is no other real choice coal is one of the few fuel sources which has a real capacity to expand
1187262 i dont think in my lifetime i will ever see more than 50 percent of the coal fired plants in china being fitted with ccs
1187263 i think you resign yourself to the fact that youll only be able to stabilize temperatures at a higher level and then well see what the impact is
1187264 i feel like what happened was a blessing in disguise
1187265 this is something i think has brought this team closer together you may think i sound crazy for saying that but i really think this is bigger than me and steve
1187266 i think that was a big step for this team to accomplish the goals we wanted to accomplish
1187267 because i felt like if i didnt forgive him then it would divide the team up and we could pretty much throw this season away
1187268 he expects to catch every ball and i expect to defend every ball
1187269 when you have those two types of individuals something has to give when its 100 degrees out there and youre tired and youre frustrated sometimes emotions get involved
1187270 im sure if he had a calmer head he would have made better decisions i dont fault him for that there are times where i may want to hit somebody but i control myself i tell some of my other teammates you have to learn to keep your composure typically people do crazy things they regret when theyre emotional i think he just got too emotional at the time
1187271 lucs a standup guy and i commend him for everything hes done in this whole ordeal
1187272 and were behind steve hes still one of ours i have a daughter and if she does something that i dont like of course im going to be mad but at the end of the day shes still my daughter and im still going to love her hes still part of this team and hes still our family so were still behind him
1187273 you arent in high school anymore its time to find a new way to deal with what is missing in your life
1187274 it was done so quietly no one knew until after they left
1187275 i want to go out to people and say to them you tell me what you aspire for your institution

1187279 gazz is indie noize featured band at blog of sound
1187280 im willing to admit that ive been going through a very bad time with depression
1187281 ive finally decided to get professional help its not something that blossomed up overnight im on medication trying to get better
1187282 ive really had a lot on my mind really been contemplating a lot of things
1187283 in the state that im in had he reported i would be at training camp physically but mentally i could have gotten myself hurt or gotten one of my teammates hurt
1187284 football is important its a means to an end but my mental health i feel like is a lot more important
1187285 thats a helluva lot of money moneys good moneys a necessity but its not everything i cant put a price tag on my mental state
1187286 i just want to look em in the eye and let em all know this wasnt bs this was for the mental health of me i could have gone out there and gotten any one of you hurt
1187287 it was awesome to see jimmy tearing it up on the drums with our good friends sink to see special thanks to all our friends and fans who came out to support sink to see
1187288 i think were going to try to do some things with anquan but i wouldnt feel comfortable with him going into the game without having done a lot of reps
1187289 oh youve never heard of such and such listen to this
1187290 definitely the relationships ive formed with the students i feel like my mentees big sister
1187291 this is as close as ill ever get to a beatle since she broke them up
1187292 it has dramatically changed the way we run our lives
1187293 until recently universities and professional societies have ducked out of this because they dont want to be lightning rods for extremists
1187294 far fewer incidents of harassment have been directed at our faculty
1187295 perpetrators must be stopped using whatever means necessary and the use of force is a morally righteous tactic furthermore it is the most likely tactic to be effective in halting these atrocities
1187296 with a broad brush it makes everyone who cares about animals look like an extremist and that plays into the hands of people who exploit them they are able to discredit what we do
1187297 he left austins three children in the burning house when he fled
1187298 its so nice to escape it feels good to be here its nice that people care
1187299 its nice that people care at least its not like vietnam and people dont just spit on us
1187300 its going to help him go forward and do what he needs to do in life
1187301 it says that people can be antiwar and still really want to help the veterans
1187302 dont give the head tilt and look at them with sympathetic eyes
1187303 look at them and be proud its going to be difficult sure but these guys are going to make the life they want
1187304 living in a hospital waiting for hours in waiting rooms sucks the life out of your day
1187305 as in our past surveys very few macintosh users reported so much as a single virus or spyware infection
1187306 for decades the medial temporal lobe structures have been linked to both memory and spatial cognition
1187307 so we set out to test how these two abilities related to one another and to the temporal lobe area of the brain
1187308 we concluded that the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex are not essential for path integration since we showed that the tests could be successfully accomplished despite damage to these brain regions
1187309 appropriate representation of the issues and provided excellent guidance for improvement of va research efforts
1187310 im grateful the investigators substantiated that there was waste and mismanagement
1187311 has had a distinguished career and has a long standing interest in biomedical research
1187312 and theyre the ones who are hurt by this delay
1187313 he was lying in the middle of the street motionless
1187314 i blame myself a lot for not being able to identify the threat simply because of the way i heard the shots
1187315 as much as i wanted to get out there im seriously physically challenged by not being able to hear
1187316 the guys to my left and right dont deserve anything to happen to them because of my personal pride
1187317 hes going to have one hell of a time understanding what people say if he cant get visual cues
1187318 limits his ability to identify enemy locations by sound hear commands from his team leaders hear radio traffic over a squad radio or speak with local nationals in combat which could have negative ramifications to the mission
1187319 hearing loss is present in all forms in the army
1187320 its impossible to validate whether he will lose his hearing more or less in the future i feel that infantry is his best place
1187321 thats kevin wanting to lead his men and do the right thing
1187322 wants to stay infantry this is his life i vote he stays infantry
1187323 i came to terms with myself and realized that i was not as confident in my ability to continue my job
1187324 it was better for me to realize this than to ignore it
1187325 i dont know how to approach commanders and tell them of what my feelings are
1187326 because ive been around long enough to know that ill be looked at as a quitter
1187327 we see cases of soldiers deploying when they did not meet the hearing standards
1187328 the commander has to make the call based on the mission but the doctors should make the case very clearly that deploying cpl x against his or her medical judgment is a decision that could be held against the commander
1187329 this is a disability you dont want to get worse
1187330 you dont want this person to be put in a position where he might hurt himself or others
1187331 they say my symptoms are mimicking signs of depression who the hell knows what that means
1187332 they gave me three sheets of paper with breathing techniques another describing how to imagine being in a happy place and to remind myself to relax when i started getting anxious
1187333 for them to tell me to think happy thoughts is what will resolve my issues immediately i have no faith in their judgment
1187334 staff sgt dunne attested that he could fulfill his duties
1187335 dunne relayed that he did not want to let down his soldiers so he did not report his condition
1187336 you cant ask the person to make the determination because emotionally theyre too connected to wanting to overcome their disability
1187337 i say the truth and they dont like that around here
1187338 mr donley has been personally advised by both the administrative officer and the chief medical officer at the clinic that volunteers will be permitted to continue providing coffee to clinic patients and that he is in no way to interfere with this service
1187339 not at mine ive got sneeze guards all around im in total control of everything
1187340 she stormed in looked at me and she says who authorized you to put that sign there
1187341 i says no one i says i have the right in my contract she says how dare you talk to me like that says it right it front of my wife
1187342 i want to expose them for what they are trying to do to me a veteran
1187343 they were basically trying to squeeze me out of there
1187344 this is one bleeding part of a budget and not just in one department but in a lot of departments
1187345 when you have something bleeding like this there can be a lot of money saved
1187346 from a management standpoint this is something that can easily be handled
1187347 its critical use or necessary use versus well weve got the money lets go out and buy some more cars
1187348 where that spike in overall costs came from i have no idea
1187349 cost of paying one driver overtime to cover both weekday shifts and weekends would be prohibitive
1187350 kind of a rule of thumb is the more cars you control the more powerful you are and so that sort of attitude of kingdom building is part of the problem here
1187351 i am so surprised but i knew the lord heard my prayers
1187352 when you go through life day after day you dont think about anything like this and you dont realize there are so many nice people
1187353 what lidia was willing to do for him means that we all have to do what we can to help
1187354 from my deepest heart i have already been blessed by having this experience with mr martinek
1187355 we never stop a group and tell people good luck
1187356 and i would say amongst our staff and the ones knowledgeable about that it is also understood
1187357 at this point there is not sufficient research to determine if this more focused method is more effective
1187358 group therapy can be part of a successful treatment program when it is used as one component of an overall treatment plan
1187359 existing treatment strategies have provided comfort and relief for some older veterans who have suffered for many years
1187360 we must augment those treatments not replace or eliminate them
1187361 but there are ways to deal with it and we learned that every day when we got together we have that bond weve developed between us we want the right to be together to continue our treatment
1187362 i love the guys because they help me function more properly
1187363 you can regress when you dont have the support of the group
1187364 we have been led down the primrose path quite a few times so well see how it turns out
1187365 but well give the therapist our full cooperation were hopeful
1187366 there are areas in this va where you could not get any better care anywhere
1187367 but when it comes to the mental health department it drops off severely in terms of the quality of care
1187368 id see someone once a month for three months then get someone new i never knew if they were going to completely change my meds
1187369 he talks to me after hours on his own nickel or he squeezes me in on his lunch break i try to get to him about every four or five weeks its been about nine weeks now because a bunch of psychiatrists quit
1187370 we are always looking at ways to improve access to care
1187371 there likely will be continued growth there is supposed to be money for additional staffing
1187372 was like being disrespected again like when we came back from vietnam it was like being cut loose from the herd
1187373 a man neednt go far to find a subject if hes ready with his salt box
1187374 dont tell your mom ive been sleeping on her couch
1187375 the weather down here seems to be the best so far
1187376 i wouldnt mind banning alcohol on the beach at all
1187377 youve been drinking all day then you drive they drive home i think its dangerous especially that stretch of highway
1187378 wed take a second thought but wed probably still come down
1187379 conger can have his blood money but for the life of me i cannot justify payment of 50 000 to a police officer for care of an animal that he allowed to died under his protection
1187380 well no i really wouldnt want to but if i had the opportunity would i give it some serious thought yes
1187381 it just doesnt work with groceries the way they are with gas what it is rent what it is they cant make it and so more and more of them are looking to get back into the workplace
1187382 well i was afraid of it and i dont know why i thought id break it
1187383 he told me to stand still and turn around he took my wrist and handcuffed me my hearts racing
1187384 he told me to face him and he grabbed my shirt and bra in one hand and had a flashlight in the other
1187385 he exposed my breasts i was feeling shame humiliation took over and fear
1187386 it upset me that theres another victim police didnt do their job five or six years ago
1187387 the bottom line is this administration has moved towards barack obamas positions john mccain is still stuck on the low road express
1187388 hes even dangerous i think for the direction of this country
1187389 i asked barack what he wanted for his birthday and he said just three things indiana colorado and virginia
1187390 john mccain is looking for someone for vice president who has more economic expertise than he does so congratulations to all of you youre on the short list
1187391 then why did kerry beg mccain to be kerrys vp in 04
1187392 john mccain is looking for someone for vice president who has more economic expertise than he does so congratulations to all of you youre on the short list
1187393 i asked barack what he wanted for his birthday and he said just three things indiana colorado and virginia
1187394 the truth is that mccains campaign has received 1 33 million from individuals employed in the oil and gas industry not 2 million
1187395 we find the 2 million figure is based on a mistaken calculation
1187396 it appears the obama campaign is adding our data from january 2007 through may 2008 our total then was about 1 million to a total for june fundraising from oil gas interests that was reported in the washington post on july 27 the post reported that mccain and the republican national committees victory fund raised 1 1 million in june alone from oil and gas executives
1187397 not all of the money the victory fund collects ends up in mccains campaign account although its all intended to support his candidacy
1187398 so whats the bottom line according to the center for responsive politics thats us john mccains campaign had collected 1 3 million from oil and gas interests through june if you add in the money being collected by the republican party to support mccains candidacy the total figure could be 2 million as obamas campaign claims or it could be a little less or a little more but until the accounting is sorted out between the mccain campaign and the victory fund we cant put a precise dollar figure on it
1187399 how about 50 million last month for obama where did that money come from
1187400 is always pained to have to extend tours he understands the effect that has on the families of our forces but he also appreciates our commanders need to make additional progress while the weather is still good in afghanistan
1187401 we respect the commissioners decision and the thoroughness of the process
1187402 we provided the league with all information requested so they could be comprehensive in their decision making our focus has been and continues to be on our football team and having a successful season
1187403 i have a pretty good idea how that article went down but you can shape the environment however you want one way or the other
1187404 ive just got to go out and do my part if it happens it happens if it dont it dont
1187405 theres just so many different things and you hear something new every day
1187406 i still know a lot of people over there so i follow them its the craziest situation youve ever seen
1187407 so much can be expressed through a walk you know i think thats one of the things that a lot of animators dont do these days is actually crack the walk so that it actually says something about the character
1187408 what would the world be like if nobody did a job they didnt want to do
1187409 terrorattackerna aldrig kunnat genomf ras utan m jligheten att transportera ledarna f re under och efter attackerna och ge dem m jlighet att forts tta d dandet n sta dag
1187410 the independent inspector of elections certified the results of the election and yahoo accurately announced those results
1187411 yahoo did not participate in the execution of the votes and was not a party to any errors which may have been made either by a voting institution or a proxy processing intermediary acting on behalf of banks brokers and institutions
1187412 it will not change any substantive outcome that i can foresee
1187413 we dont oppose the olympics but its wrong for them to demolish our house its wrong
1187414 we believe with the support of the government with the help of the international community we have the confidence and the ability to host a safe and secure olympic games
1187415 saddened at the loss of life and injuries caused by the attack and extend our condolences to the victims and their families
1187416 refrain from using this incident to crack down further upon peaceful uighurs
1187417 we condemn all acts of violence the uyghur people do not support acts that engender bloodshed
1187418 especially in the vast countryside heavily populated by uighurs the chinese government has rolled out a political movement without end or reason that is unbearable to the uighur peasantry the entire uighur people live in a blanket state of fear
1187419 this time they actually managed to carry out their plan but it will not affect the olympics greatly
1187420 the threat from east turkestan forces exist but their capabilities are limited
1187421 big 4 are immune from dropping points this season so putting a decent run of results together should see the table close up again
1187422 always use the selected program to open this kind of file
1187423 there was something truly filthy my emphasis about china and russias vetoes of the american led un security council effort to impose targeted sanctions on robert mugabes ruling clique in zimbabwe
1187424 to prevent attorney general michael mukasey from having to comply with a house panel subpoena for material on the leak of cia operative valerie plames identity
1187425 i wouldnt want to stay here its too old and cold and settled in its ways here
1187426 i gave you my body my soul and my chrysanthemum for i am yours you are my lord you are my darling you are my orgy you are my folly
1187427 i was still suffering from my crash but it is going better every day
1187428 eating with your hands its pure regression naturally everyone wants it
1187429 the meat needs to be a mix of fatty and lean not raw not rare it must be medium rare at the same time the bread needs to be smooth tepid toasted on the sesame side i like to brush the soft side with butter there needs to be a crispy chiffonade of iceberg lettuce everything plays a role
1187430 we cling to things like the soft buns sweet and sour pickles onions tomatoes cheese we need these guideposts because we dont have the history the context otherwise for us its not a burger its a hot sandwich
1187431 what you have is texture and the flavor of meat
1187432 a hamburger whats that i didnt get it then i tasted it at db bistro moderne
1187433 if daniel hadnt done it maybe i wouldnt have either he helped me understand
1187434 i think its shocking but at the same time the french are realizing that a burger is real food its good
1187435 nobody ever saw a burger until 10 years ago everybody was against it but everybody goes to eat it
1187436 but nine out of 10 people use knife and fork im happy not to see it im in the kitchen
1187437 another thing ive noticed is that the muscled guys order the boeuf double with bacon egg and fries and a diet coke
1187438 then they share a cheesecake they dont want to gain weight
1187439 the growing gap between wages and inflation is the reason why thousands of council workers will reluctantly be going on strike
1187440 so my brothers in 6th grade gifted this year guess who he got as his teacher
1187441 we dont oppose the olympics but its wrong for them to demolish our house its wrong
1187442 we believe with the support of the government with the help of the international community we have the confidence and the ability to host a safe and secure olympic games
1187443 saddened at the loss of life and injuries caused by the attack and extend our condolences to the victims and their families
1187444 refrain from using this incident to crack down further upon peaceful uighurs

1187446 especially in the vast countryside heavily populated by uighurs the chinese government has rolled out a political movement without end or reason that is unbearable to the uighur peasantry the entire uighur people live in a blanket state of fear
1187447 this time they actually managed to carry out their plan but it will not affect the olympics greatly
1187448 the threat from east turkestan forces exist but their capabilities are limited
1187449 suggested earth like soil further analysis has revealed un earthlike aspects of the soil chemistry
1187450 it is a reactive compound its not usually considered an ingredient for life
1187451 i believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality
1187452 when i looked around i saw families enjoying the exhibits
1187453 its probably the best first game weve played since ive been here its a shame the score ended up the way it did but we got a number of things done some of the young guys we hoped would play well really did step up and play well it was really encouraging in a lot of areas
1187454 those guys did a good job we were able to go in with our second unit and protect the passer enough we had some experienced quarterbacks playing newly signed veterans jared lorenzen and quinn gray which helped even though they had only been with us about two weeks
1187455 they know how to manage games and get some things done
1187456 it was predominantly them on the inside mike steve and jamey playing in those three inside spots
1187457 it was just a matter of everyone out there doing a good job
1187458 they played a lot we wanted to see them and they did a good job
1187459 the young receivers played very well when they got in
1187460 mike hart and chad simpson ran the ball well and caught it and we were able to generate that offense and not have problems moving the
1187461 its usually a struggle and usually defenses are ahead of the offenses at this time of the preseason the fact that we were able to move the ball and washington moved the ball pretty well just shows you how sharp the offenses were
1187462 he managed the game really well he didnt make any errors he converted some third downs we had to have he threw the ball on target and just was very calm and very poised out there he had to make about five third down throws he hit them and put them in the right spots he knew what we needed to get he really did a good job and threw accurately
1187463 we had some things that went pretty well especially our pass rush
1187464 i thought we had some of our young defensive linemen in there really active and playing well jeff charleston and marcus howard in particular that was good to see
1187465 we had some really good performances from a lot of young guys and guys who are going to make the team playing really well that does lead me to believe that when we get down to 53 well have a lot of good players
1187466 i thought adam kicked the ball really well his kickoffs and his field goals were high and accurate hunter punted well and for the first time in a long time we were able to get off some long punts and cover them well that was a good sign
1187467 i thought t j rushing and pierre each had an outstanding return that was good to see our special teams get going the way they did
1187468 you really are looking at things from a different perspective
1187469 theyre missing some players too but you want to see how efficiently they play the game and you want to see if young guys look like they belong and if they fit in that was the most encouraging thing that you saw some young guys and ill include jim sorgi in that that looked fine and looked like they had been there a long time thats what youre hoping for early on like this
1187470 all of the experts agree if the first drug doesnt work the execution is going to be excruciating

1187475 if he had raised the issue at his probable cause hearing the court would have complied
1187476 its no longer jennifer and elizabeth have been murdered but theres nothing we can do about that they dont care about jennifer they dont care about elizabeth they only care about saving jose medellin
1187477 the only challenge they raised has been whether or not he had an opportunity to speak with his consulate which he did not raise
1187478 some of his relatives testified at his punishment and no one even brought it up at that time it was never an issue

1187481 yeah i want to cancel my service thats my final decision i dont want to hear about what you can do to make it better
1187482 look i dont have all day i just want you to cancel my service
1187483 well if you had 10 monthes or less we would charge you 20 mth but you have 11 so its 400
1187484 should i charge you the 400 or are you going to continue your service with fido
1187485 neither do you have a manager or someone higher up that i can talk im not going to argue with you and im not going to pay 400
1187486 well maam you are going to have to pay 400 but i can transfer you to my manager who will explain the costs to you
1187487 no of course not miss j i am very sorry some of our service reps just want to get the call over with as fast as possible 400 is the maximum we can charge but because of x y and z it would only cost you 180 to cancel
1187488 well that is a much more reasonable fee but i dont think i should be charged anything really since i am switching to rogers which owns fido ive already signed a three year contract with rogers
1187489 after egoscue we were back at the gym for another two hour practice this days practice was probably the best one yet our defense had definitely improved and a lot of us were making plays that we never had in the past we found ourselves being able to get to more balls and felt that the egoscue stretches and conditioning were really making a difference in the way we could control our movements
1187490 why does the universe respond so quickly to negative thoughts in my life and so slowly to positive thoughts

1187496 while our display advertising has been relatively soft the other components of our business such as cpc deposits insurance retirement and credit cards are all doing very well
1187497 our programming strategy is to try to deliver the best experience on the best platform and by far that is the best way
1187498 weve got these passionate passionate taekwondo fans passionate equestrian fans folks whove grown up playing the sports whose children play them and for whom the olympics is the ultimate expression of their sport despite the fact that weve been putting it on five cable networks with as much press time as we can we have not been able to serve the audience as effective they want us to
1187499 weve decided not to do live commentary on every hour of those more than 2 000 live streams because of the costs
1187500 this has been a big initiative with us and with the ioc as well weve invested a lot in the olympus and as a consequence will work very hard to protect that investment weve worked with the ioc on fingerprint solutions and worked with some of the major ugc distributors including youtube to find a way to identify videos not being put out by nbc
1187501 it will be very quick i cant give you a per second by second analysis but our goal is to catch it before its posted thats the intention theres no such thing as a perfect system in the world of the internet because theres always a place some analog method where someone can post something
1187502 we spent a tremendous time of amount and effort to deliver the olympics and the best experiences we can and we want to make sure we preserve that because that reflects well on the olympics and reflects well on nbc
1187503 we have to deliver what we promise and we have to work hard to preserve the integrity of the brand
1187504 web 2 0 is one of those big buzzwords that no one knows what it means if it means that the world is a community and tying that community together we do have a strategy there
1187505 the rights landscape is what it is we are protecting our rights within our territory
1187506 its not necessarily an environment that lends itself to germination of ideas and people sharing clips and being able to form communities over time i mean youre going to be in and out of swimming in eight or nine days so thats why we think the better place for this is in universal sports where you can form that community and lend people the tools to experiment
1187507 you pass it to your friends and the faster you pass you win or if you drop it you get notified i think its a fun application and it helps people connect we find ways for people to connect but ultimately we want people to go to nbcolympics com because we think its the best place to experience these games
1187508 we cant deliver you results for 34 sports and 10 000 athlete bios and breaking news every day in a facebook widget its not complete and so we think the best experience is to come to nbcolympics com as a hub and connect to other places

1187522 please for the love of all that is good and holy
1187523 okay this isnt so hard i can totally handle this nothing to sweat
1187524 theres still nothing concrete but theres been contact between the two clubs but i have not heard from milan personally
1187525 surely this was a one off milan with only one of seven attackers available but this does not justify the result which does alarm us
1187526 tomorrow morning i will meet with coach carlo ancelotti and i will have a report from the doctor or the fitness trainer to clarify the situation i was shocked by the result because milan is the most well known club throughout the world and a world champion we cannot have these results publicised around the world but i am convinced that we are strong partly because just a few days ago we won the trofeo tim against inter and juventus

1187528 carrizo is an important signing in my position and i am glad to see him here because he speaks the same language and we get on well
1187529 it is really important that we can communicate and i feel better on and off the pitch which is a big thing
1187530 i want to win the scudetto with lazio and i think this year we can finish fourth
1187531 we have a very strong group and can make a quick return to the champions league
1187532 he can be powerful as a winger as he can make runs and cut into the centre
1187533 im waiting for the double passport i hope to get it soon with my heart i want to stay in buenos aires but the head tells me that the time has come to try a new experience abroad
1187534 napoli are a huge club it would be very difficult for anyone to reject it then with the argentines there is a certain feeling
1187535 except for inter and milan i dont see any teams that are better than fiorentina
1187536 i dont know whether real madrid were really interested in me too but i know that the violas offer was real and i am playing for an excellent team who can fight for the scudetto
1187537 dont just hope for new energy vote for new energy

1187539 if they try to stick a safety or a linebacker on me im going to run right by them davis said

1187541 they had no chance no chance at all davis said
1187542 thats to be expected 49ers defensive end justin smith said of the skirmishes
1187543 like ive said before if something is important youll fight about it
1187544 were really pleased with him hes running like crazy and doing a lot of nice things
1187545 hes physical and he uses his speed we werent expecting a lot of him and all of a sudden hes doing pretty good martz said
1187546 i think theyre both excellent footballers i really do they have great enthusiasm and desire to play the game its a typical brazilian situation and they just love playing
1187547 theyre determined and quick good footballers what we dont know is their game appreciation as theyve not played for a year because of the situation with their old club fluminense as they didnt play them because they were joining us
1187548 then they joined us in january and of course it was too late for the work permit for the application their 18th birthdays meant we could apply for international clearance which we got a couple of days ago
1187549 im delighted for the kids theyve worked so hard every training session and never missed a session
1187550 peterborough were the better side in the first half and should have been 2 0 up
1187551 but there were some plus points for us as well
1187552 rafael da silva played the full 90 minutes and was pleasing and his brother fabio played 45 minutes as well
1187553 i was really pleased with their contributions and it will be interesting to see how they get on this season

1187574 does any body know what the curse is going on with the
1187575 re brackman from a post on pinstripes plus it sounds like he has gotten himself into tremendous phsyical shape and is an extremely hard worker hopefully that puts him closer to the melancon rehab category vs the garcia sanchez if memory serves had his surgery later than the other guys so he is a few months behind
1187576 can there be the making of manny curse on the sox
1187577 someone just has to tell the rays that it isnt preseason anymore
1187578 does anyone know where i can buy yankee tickets i cant get any from the yankees website i guess its all sold out and ive tried stubhub but its pretty expensive does anyone know anywhere else i can get them im looking for a weekend game it doesnt matter who its against
1187579 has boston lost since hes been gone some freakin curse
1187580 how do you guys feel about xavier in left abreu in right damon dh matsui traded stache gone posada at first pudge comes back instead of letting abreu walk damon in left posada catch before hes ready and matsui dh i cant trust that matsui will staying healthy for a whole year imo one of damon or matsui have to go
1187581 tyler kepner is reporting that hughes drove to aaa scranton last night with shelley duncan
1187582 fredo dont worry relax i cant even name 3 players on that aaa squad they played against their time will come
1187583 jorge steinbrenner at least you got some games in i havent been to the stadium all year and probably wont get to go ive been following the yankees since 2000 and im only 15 but i really wanted to get to the stadium this year ive only been to one game even though i only live like an hour away the game was sept 10 2005 against the red sox and we lost in an absolute blowout i didnt get to go to monument park or anything thats really why i want to go to see the plaques and retired numbers i feel like its a rite of passage for any yankee fan
1187584 dont underestimate the impact revenue sharing has had on teams like the rays they have been sellers every year of their existence at the trade deadline this year they were buyers
1187585 my hope for the lineup tonight jeter damon a rod abreu nady giambi i rod cano melky any questions
1187586 im am against signing a first baseman for another 7 years fool me once so what your saying is if posada cant catch hes useless ill take his healthy bat on my team anyday dh wouldnt be a bad idea as well as far as right field is concerned you think it was bad having damon roam center how about having weak arms in right they would make singles into doubles all day long first to third on every play if you know someone who can be our first baseman thats name isnt tex im all ears besides i strongly believe hes going back home to baltimore anyways
1187587 at this moment if you only had one of these pitchers to sign for next year which would it be pettitte or mussina
1187588 so what your saying is if posada cant catch hes useless
1187589 thats why i think we should keep sexy for a defensive replacement ala clark and olerud
1187590 rebecca optimist prime august 4th 2008 at 4 00 pm hughes has got to have at least a few starts at scranton no
1187591 hughes has got to have at least a few starts at scranton no
1187592 according to kay on yes he said girardi charted pitch counts for hughes and some guy named carl from 55 75 85 and then 105 pitches
1187593 so whats wrong with bringing phil back to the majors sooner rather than later and having him start games with a shortened pitch count they way they did with joba is that crazy
1187594 why should the team dole out money thats basically paying him for what hes done in the past and not really paying him based on what hes now capable of
1187595 phil coke to aaa as well maybe coke to the show next month
1187596 sos27 you are right the confidence thing will be important for him given the performance earlier in the season i wonder if it was all caused by the rib thing
1187597 jorge steinbrenner given what tex will cost and what he will be at the end of a 8 10 year contract i am sure the yanks already have ccs size 60 tall jersey being ordered
1187598 sos27 you are right the confidence thing will be important for him given the performance earlier in the season i wonder if it was all caused by the rib thing i noticed that tyler didnt mention that pavano drove up with phil and shelley thats good news
1187599 i noticed that tyler didnt mention that pavano drove up with phil and shelley thats good news
1187600 hey carl can i bang alyssa can i bang alyssa
1187601 will anyone actually give him 8 10 though hes not a rod and he only found one suitor
1187602 brandon jetes gidp count 18 starting to believe arod will never win a championship august 4th 2008 at 4 18 pm ed phil coke has already been in aaa for a week hughes in aaa is big that has to mean he is near ready i know rafeal chaves will tune this kid up hopefully like he did for king felix its going to be rafys first time working w phil that can only be a plus
1187603 i think phils stuff along with a 95 96 mph fastball
1187604 fredo that is a bit unfair i know he was consistently 92 93 up here in the bigs but he had the occasional 95 mph burst so he can do it doing it with consistency is the key
1187605 move nady up and drop jeter in the lineup who is with me

1187609 new york is wasting tens of millions of dollars annually by paying the medical expenses of thousands of former residents who have long since moved out of state an explosive new audit has found
1187610 at a time when scores of companies are freezing pensions for their workers some are quietly converting their pension plans into resources to finance their executives retirement benefits and pay
1187611 in recent years companies from intel corp to centurytel inc collectively have moved hundreds of millions of dollars of obligations for executive benefits into rank and file pension plans this lets companies capture tax breaks intended for pensions of regular workers and use them to pay for executives supplemental benefits and compensation
1187612 the practice has drawn scant notice a close examination by the wall street journal shows how it works and reveals that the maneuver besides being a dubious use of tax law risks harming regular workers it can drain assets from pension plans and make them more likely to fail now with the current bear market in stocks weakening many pension plans this practice could put more in jeopardy
1187613 how many is impossible to tell neither the internal revenue service nor other agencies track this maneuver employers generally reveal little about it some benefits consultants have warned them not to in order to forestall a backlash by regulators and lower level workers
1187614 the background federal law encourages employers to offer pensions by giving companies a tax deduction when they contribute cash to a pension plan and by letting the money in the plan grow tax free executives like anyone else can participate in these plans but their benefits cant be disproportionately large irs rules say pension plans must not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees if a company wants to give its executives larger pensions as most do it must provide supplemental executive pensions which dont carry any tax advantages
1187615 so how can companies boost regular pension benefits for select executives while still passing the irss nondiscrimination tests
1187616 the scathing and still secret audit determined that nearly 30 000 people in new york city alone were improperly on the states medicaid rolls from november 2006 to november 2007 even while they were enrolled in the medicaid programs of other states auditors from state comptroller thomas dinapolis office using federally developed computerized record checks in 44 states determined that nearly 13 000 of the former city residents should have been investigated for violation of new yorks medicaid regulations
1187617 new york state accounted for 13 1 of medicaid hospital beneficiaries compared with 8 6 of all medicaid beneficiaries three possible explanations include new york medicaid recipients being sicker than average new york recipients receiving health care in hospitals that takes place in other settings in other states and new york state recipients receiving care in hospitals for conditions that go untreated in other states a fourth possible explanation is that in order to maximize revenues new yorks hospitals are providing treatment to those who are in fact from other states and countries a great deal for everyone except new york state and city taxpayers and one no one wants to talk about
1187618 the official called the audits findings the tip of the iceberg of medicaid abuse by former state residents
1187619 with more than 75 000 jobs already cut and more than 400 billion of credit losses the proverbial blood is flowing on wall street and while there are still four to five months left in the year annual bonuses representing the bulk of wall street pay are expected to fall by 30 to 40 percent recruiters and compensation experts said

1187636 many businesses these days are so convinced that employment law is weighted on the side of the employees that they are afraid to tackle serious issues in the workplace employers should not be afraid of using disciplinary and grievance procedures if used correctly they ensure that everybody is dealt with fairly and reasonably employers must ensure that they are compliant with current legislation as there is confusion among employers as to what rights employees have today

1187656 my wife has never been that comfortable with the pill so it would be nice to have some other options on my end
1187657 if we had a compound that was 99 effective then the drug companies would be on board the fda food and drug administration would be on board and consumers would embrace it
1187658 i really feel like i enjoy swimming now more than i ever have i enjoy competing more than i ever have

1187665 the science is not at the stage where we can give a 100 guarantee to any athlete that they are clean

1187667 the guy who invented them is great friends with my coach who is also german
1187668 after talking to him and learning more about them why not take a product where you know the person who made it and know exactly what is in the product why take a chance with something on the market where you dont know if its tainted or not
1187669 because it helps my recovery and its not illegal so why not
1187670 so in the water its not about power but more about making my stroke more efficient
1187671 i decided to become an open book and asked to be tested in any way they want to show im clean
1187672 i understand if i just sat there and said i passed my tests that people wouldnt believe me ive gone beyond the call of duty to prove im clean but you are guilty until proven innocent in this day and age so what else can i do its a real bummer
1187673 i feel like i have so many middle aged women who look up to me i want them to feel proud and feel like they can do what they set out to do

1187681 managers find it easy to motivate high performing indviduals but are not so adept when it comes to supporting poorer performing employees
1187682 some of the greatest opportunities for improved organisational performance lie in helping managers raise the bar for moderate and poorer performers but it appears from our study that few employers are doing this
1187683 everybody reads the new york times every day and takes it as orthodoxy signing books on that basis it was evident very quickly how insular the whole system is they could all name three four five chefs but couldnt name a single clergyman

1187758 climate scientists dont use temperature charts to prove global warming
1187759 andrew impishly asks so dude wheres my global warming i might as easily respond with the question so mate whats propping temperatures up
1187760 if global warming has stopped why was the most recent decade 0 86c hotter than the same decade from 100 years before
1187761 andrew also claims that the seas have stopped rising because of a dip in 2007 but he left out the standard inverse barometer correction with this the blip then vanishes
1187762 the inverted barometer does not have much apparent effect on the global mean sea level because the ocean as a whole is not compressible

1187776 what about the video cameras in the convenience store didnt they catch anything
1187777 you would think but he killed that employee then shot up all the equipment in the backroom

1187795 its not going to be majorly different but hopefully the melodies will be nicer the guitar solos will be better the production will be better you just try to improve in every area
1187796 there isnt much to change but yet there is the last three albums have been very much guitar orientated and this one probably will be as well but i want to try to do some extra coloring in with the vocals
1187797 bands always say our new album is faster and heavier and then its never true so were not gonna say that but playing fast just works for us people who say we play too fast are probably right but guess what theres a million other bands that play slow people listen to dragonforce and go to the show because they know that were doing something other bands arent doing

1187810 no person may discharge spill or dump substances or materials which are not entirely composed of storm water into receiving bodies of water storm sewers or drainage facilities
1187811 he could not say whether hed feel this was a violation of any law
1187812 an argument could be made that they dnr owe the public a higher standard of care than others when it comes to dumping of materials into a stormwater drain if it is suggested that this is an isolated incident that should not require punishment has the dnr or mmsd taken the same approach when there were single instances of alleged violations by private sector parties
1187813 there was so much blood it was gurgling down the storm drains like crimson bathwater

1187831 i guess jerry yang didnt come out of the meeting as unscathed as it seemed
1187832 we were surprised at the very high vote counts that were pro jerry yang
1187833 certainly the final results seemed very different from the exit polls
1187834 it seems odd that fewer shares would be voted this year compared to last when theres been such additional scrutiny on the company in the wake of the dealings with microsoft and carl icahn
1187835 the independent inspector of elections certified the results of the election and yahoo accurately announced those results
1187836 yahoo did not participate in the execution of the votes and was not a party to any errors which may have been made either by a voting institution or a proxy processing intermediary acting on behalf of banks brokers and institutions
1187837 capital research global investors asked broadridge financial to double check the votes it transmitted to yahoo on its behalf
1187838 i think jerry yang is still firmly in place until some deviation happens from the plan yahoo has set forth

1187868 we send money home and it has a tremendous impact on the economy
1187869 in a private hospital in the philippines a nurse can make about 220 a month at albany medical center nurses earn 220 a day

1187880 in about a week it will be back it goes hand and hand with winning
1187881 i would have kept it if we were winning that game
1187882 i think were going to try to do some things with anquan but i wouldnt feel comfortable with him going into the game without having done a lot of reps
1187883 it doesnt matter if youre joe the milkman or whoever
1187884 regardless of whether you go to the super bowl or not youve got to learn from your mistakes youll get punished for them
1187885 no one wants to go to jail but like i said youve got to learn from your mistakes you get punished for them i did what i had to do just to get through this
1187886 it should be over with after the second 30 days all of this comes from the juvenile thing
1187887 i went to court about it and thats just what was said
1187888 of course its always going to be in the back of your head
1187889 with me when im on the field im in another mind state and i just go out there and play my game
1187890 terrorattackerna aldrig kunnat genomf ras utan m jligheten att transportera ledarna f re under och efter attackerna och ge dem m jlighet att forts tta d dandet n sta dag
1187891 i knew id be able to run around out here this morning just taking those shots i feel like i did fine
1187892 you dont know until you start taking hits how its really going to react
1187893 no issues no flare up it didnt bother me at all
1187894 as long as were winning everybodys going to be happy with whatever role they have
1187895 ive played in running back by committee roles before whoever gets hot thats who its going to be
1187896 the reputation of this team has been damaged no question
1187897 i dont think its beyond repair and i dont think the reputation has been ruined but certainly it has taken some hits
1187898 i would like to let everybody know that i apologize for my actions
1187899 i apologize to st marys and i apologize to my teammates and to bulldog fans i made a bad decision my teammates were hurt and i just overreacted
1187900 you feel sad and sick that one of the guys youre an authority figure over and you care about got himself in trouble
1187901 you also hate the fact those guys do represent this program and this program represents this university and this university represents this state it represents anybody who claims to be a bulldog i feel sick about that
1187902 i mean theres no way you can say it hasnt been a distraction because it has been
1187903 if a guy has a first time offense i dont believe in throwing that guy under the bus to try to stave off the wolves so to speak
1187904 i dont think its fair to the guy dewberry for example i dont think i should throw dewberry off the football team ive never had a problem with darius dewberry
1187905 we will look into other ways of making sure we do a better job
1187906 i dont know if i would blame him for it with whats gone on this offseason
1187907 downtown that can be fun for a lot of guys but the team and what were able to do this season is a lot more important than going out and having fun with college students
1187908 im willing to admit that ive been going through a very bad time with depression
1187909 ive finally decided to get professional help its not something that blossomed up overnight im on medication trying to get better
1187910 ive really had a lot on my mind really been contemplating a lot of things
1187911 in the state that im in had he reported i would be at training camp physically but mentally i could have gotten myself hurt or gotten one of my teammates hurt
1187912 football is important its a means to an end but my mental health i feel like is a lot more important
1187913 thats a helluva lot of money moneys good moneys a necessity but its not everything i cant put a price tag on my mental state
1187914 every time mary kate wants to get hold of lori she feels like shes with lindsay mary kate called lindsay and told her to get her own counselor
1187915 no good is gonna come out from bashing ubuntu look what happened to your gandpa
1187916 how else can we persuade change the minds of windows users
1187917 which jobs are we going to set up and assemble today
1187918 its been confirmed now that 11 people were killed in the accident its the worst one on any of our peaks
1187919 he brought honor not only to us his family but to the whole country when he became the first irishman to summit k 2
1187920 the last few days have been a rollercoaster of emotion as we celebrated with joy his historic achievement and now must try to come to terms with the untimely loss of a great son brother and friend
1187921 we were astonished we had to move it that took of course many many hours some turned back because they did not trust it anymore
1187922 whenever small groups combine thinking it will be easier for them to go to the summit in the end this is what happens
1187923 microsoft windows server update services wsus blocked from deploying security updates
1187924 well you shouldve been more thorough when you came to look at the place
1187925 these kids came out and just worked hard the kids had a great attitude it was a hot one but we got through it
1187926 were focusing on the fundamentals and trying to get in shape
1187927 were looking at each position and teaching technique some kids are familiar with where theyre at some are not its about getting out there and getting in as many reps as possible
1187928 a lot of kids are going to grow up quick
1187929 we dont have many seniors but the ones we have are good players we are going to ask a whole lot from the juniors and even some sophomores are going to grow up early but the good thing is that we have the players that are capable of doing it
1187930 its going to put us a day behind but well get right back at it
1187931 but thats part of it all starting up the season it wasnt too bad the kids and coaches were ready and we had a good morning
1187932 we have some new coaches and the kids were up tempo and ready to go theyre excited about a good year
1187933 you can tell who came in good shape and who didnt
1187934 were looking to get the kids in shape and build mental toughness its not about dealing with the pain more like dealing with when youre tired and your body is sore and winning in the fourth quarter thats the mental aspect too we dont want to make those mistakes late that can cost us a win
1187935 weve been debating that issue with the superintendent and principal
1187936 we think we can fit it in about 6 to 8 a m at least thats the plan for now you want to get as much practice time in as you can this early on
1187937 the soldier seems to have an air of authority in the bath tub elsa
1187938 i am probably going to die without having answered that question fully
1187939 one of the things that makes me tick more than one for the keen
1187940 the time is gone the song is over thought id something more to say
1187941 portray the artists visions of the blues and jazz experience with an emphasis on movement textures colors and the visual depiction of the resonance that makes up the rhythms of blues and jazz and its musicians
1187942 hey what did you mean by xyz what might i do to better meet their goals
1187943 there is a huge bubble of lng about to hit the market
1187944 i met with the team this morning and one of the good things for us is that they are familiar with what we want to do
1187945 we are not looking for positions because we know where everyone is going to be at everyone knows the terminology and on the same page which makes it easier for us
1187946 we are going to keep an eye on the weather
1187947 but we have to prepare for the heat and settle them down a bit on these first few days because of their excitement
1187948 it wasnt a bad morning considering we are putting in a lot of new stuff
1187949 i thought it was pretty good but for the most part most of it was conditioning as always ive stressed for these kids to come in in better shape
1187950 ive been doing this for a long time and things were pretty typical of two a day openings
1187951 one thing i was pleased with was the numbers for freshmen because they are the future of this team
1187952 it went well for a first day kids were enthusiastic and i was real proud of the way they gave their effort
1187953 i think the planning and leading up to this point was more stressful for me i tested my blood pressure and it was up which was a first for me but the kids made it easy for me
1187954 we made some tweaks on defense and have a couple of position changes
1187955 offensively we are very experienced and that made it nice not to have to go back and teach everything again
1187956 they had a good spring training and that helped with the transition
1187957 we know it will take us a few practices before everybody is comfortable
1187958 we need to look for new ways that people can protect themselves
1187959 clearly this is one of the most promising things we have in the pipeline right now
1187960 we dont know if this is going to work or not but we must get it on the agenda
1187961 we must be prepared for the answers we do get
1187962 the logical extension is to think about it for prevention of sexual or injection drug transmission
1187963 all of the experts agree if the first drug doesnt work the execution is going to be excruciating
1187964 the couch or more generally long term psychoanalytic psychotherapy was for so long a hallmark of the practice of psychiatry it no longer is
1187965 by contrast theres almost no marketing for psychotherapy which has comparable if not better outcomes
1187966 the couch turns out to be an effective 21st century treatment
1187967 im willing to admit that ive been going through a very bad time with depression
1187968 ive finally decided to get professional help its not something that blossomed up overnight im on medication trying to get better
1187969 ive really had a lot on my mind really been contemplating a lot of things
1187970 in the state that im in had he reported i would be at training camp physically but mentally i could have gotten myself hurt or gotten one of my teammates hurt
1187971 football is important its a means to an end but my mental health i feel like is a lot more important
1187972 thats a helluva lot of money moneys good moneys a necessity but its not everything i cant put a price tag on my mental state

1187979 he was always so casual that people didnt realise his inner strength in the pool
1187980 he always won his races but we didnt take any notice
1187981 we thought the other kids must not have been any good
1187982 security is very tight but we have to give him his credit card because his visa card expired in kuala lumpur
1187983 hes probably the best prepared for the olympics than hes ever been but you dont know what to expect
1187984 its nerve racking watching your children in sport id hate it if he chose tennis and we had to sit through four or five hour matches
1187985 he keeps in touch every day my little darling calls me with a progress report if he hasnt called i want a text message to know hes all right
1187986 if hes down were down its a rollercoaster i can tell just by the tone of his voice how hes feeling and if he sounds tired i always say dont overdo it and get sick
1187987 he might decide to swim on we have to wait until this is over
1187988 the details are being worked out with the doctors this week but the tentative plan is for radiation and chemotherapy
1187989 journalistic work for an indefinite but god willing not too lengthy period
1187990 in any case the sale of the banking business seems quite unlikely
1187991 we think that suncorps management likes to picture suncorp as a bank with insurance operations rather than an insurer with banking operations
1187992 such mentality is in our view unlikely to change under the current leadership
1187993 so whilst this is all a handy fall back position that must mitigate some of the risks evident in the economic and company specific backdrop it seems unlikely to eventuate
1187994 i think it is the moment to bring that back
1187995 we have revived the process of forming a tripartite alliance that is based on what we have for several years been calling the main axis of south america caracas brasilia buenos aires

1187997 oh if youre asking price is 17 and a definite no to anything lower than 15t you have nothing to worry coz am assigning u to a flagship account coz xxxx will be too easy for you and that means youre gonna get higher than ur asking price
1187998 that means people trying to buy or refinance a home will often secure a better interest rate
1187999 as of this moment the government found refuge on bpo industry its presence here in the philippines is quite obvious and it is occupying the center stage of the business game on some point i agree with how the government perceive the benefits of bpo industry and it would somehow lessen our burden with high price commodities for me it is ok to depend on bpo industry but not totally depend on it we can have it as one of the top industry but the government should not stop looking for more ways on how to improve or economic status

1188004 the couch or more generally long term psychoanalytic psychotherapy was for so long a hallmark of the practice of psychiatry it no longer is
1188005 previous research has shown that stroke patients who were depressed did not regain function as well as other patients and they had a higher risk of dying all patients who have suffered a stroke are now screened for depression but this is not the case for patients at any stage of cancer
1188006 we know that a patients mental state affects their physical state but not enough is known about why this happens we believe that when someone is depressed they lose motivation and therefore the will to live
1188007 depression affects 25 of patients with advanced cancer but at this stage it is difficult to diagnose whilst patients with advanced cancer are clearly very ill they can still be effectively treated for depression but the first step in the treatment is the recognition that the patient is depressed
1188008 with the writers strike it took so long to get underway and roger avary the writer had a commitment that was in line before working the wolfenstein stuff but ive recently been in contact with roger and hes actually working on the script right now
1188009 i think that from a progress standpoint its probably gone a little bit slower than what we would have expected you cant control these strikes and so on
1188010 theres some contract provisions and if they dont have certain things done within a certain period of time they cant just sit on the rights forever and not use them
1188011 if you think about how an operating system is loaded
1188012 its loaded onto a hard disk physically located on that machine
1188013 the operating system is tied very tightly to that hardware
1188014 join us in rejecting the ti red notion that shopping is a reasonable response to human suffering

1188017 when i heard coach harbaugh was here and had the opportunity to transfer to stanford i dont care michigan was my dream school but that puts a smile on your face
1188018 if i win this job i know i earned it it wasnt handed to me im competing against two other guys that are more than capable of getting the job done as well
1188019 it was some mop up roles but any experience on the field is good
1188020 i got to go out in front of 100 000 i got to play in different stadiums ive experienced it
1188021 the biggest thing i need to work on is consistency
1188022 but overall i think ive done pretty well i havent made too many mental errors

1188024 there has to be a total victory somewhere we must have a brute demonstration of power

1188027 a kind of confused pep talk regarding both fallujah and our upcoming southern campaign against the mahdi army
1188028 there is a series of moments and this is one of them
1188029 at every step of the way the bush administration and defense department have gone to unprecedented lengths to control and suppress information about the human cost of the wars in iraq and afghanistan
1188030 our democracy depends on an informed public and that is why it is so important that the american people see these documents these documents will help to fill the information void around the issue of civilian casualties in iraq and will lead to a more complete understanding of the prosecution of the war
1188031 as these files remind us many charges of war crimes in iraq have not seen the light of day
1188032 there are many discoveries here that should bring pause to any american who cares about this country and hopes to restore the united states respected role in the world it is time to bring the facts about this war into the sunlight and end practices that go against our laws and national values
1188033 what happened inside the bush white house and washingtons culture of deception
1188034 managed the crisis in a way that almost guaranteed that the use of force would become the only feasible option
1188035 top bush aides had outlined a strategy for carefully orchestrating the coming campaign to aggressively sell the war in the permanent campaign era it was all about manipulating sources of public opinion to the presidents advantage
1188036 what i do know is that war should only be waged when necessary and the iraq war was not necessary
1188037 a more self confident executive would be willing to acknowledge failure to trust peoples ability to forgive those who seek redemption for mistakes and show a readiness to change
1188038 the court s five justice majority said at one point when the law punishes by death it risks its own sudden descent into brutality transgressing the constitutional commitment to decency and restraint for a court not yet ready to end the long running constitutional experiment with the death penalty it was a revealing utterance of near revulsion at the process
1188039 the continuing cloud of suspicion over the white house is not something i can remove because i know only one part of the story
1188040 only those who know the underlying truth can bring this to an end sadly they remain silent
1188041 what happened inside the bush white house and washingtons culture of deception
1188042 the current design of paper money springs from the world of the sighted
1188043 the secretarys argument is analogous to contending that merely because the mobility impaired may be able either to rely on the assistance of strangers or to crawl on all fours in navigating architectural obstacles they are not denied meaningful access to public buildings
1188044 implies that criminal victimization is a necessary predicate for the disabled to invoke the rights protected under section 504 however section 504 is intended to insure that qualified individuals receive services in a manner consistent with basic human dignity
1188045 approximately half the paper currency that the bureau prints in any given year are 1 bills
1188046 the secretary s burden in demonstrating that implementing an accommodation would be unduly burdensome is particularly heavy
1188047 we had a lot of credit cards which we used and we used til the limit and then when you get to the limit and theres no more there thats where the problems come in
1188048 charging like 23 percent interest and then a late fee over that then an over the limit fee
1188049 to me if you dont have any other options i would never have touched it
1188050 we dont recommend that anyone ever dip into their 401k
1188051 there are just too many risks involved and its certainly something that no one should ever enter into without really thinking through all of the possible consequences
1188052 the thing you have to remember is that anytime you take out a loan against your 401k youre losing that future interest that you would have been gaining on that income thats probably the most important thing is that youre borrowing against your future
1188053 its pretty rare those individuals were really lucky because they had other retirement resources that they could fall back on unfortunately most of us dont
1188054 no more debt no more credit cards if you cant pay cash for it dont buy it
1188055 it should have been fixed it should have never happened if the fence was fixed shed still be here she might have had just a seatbelt bruise
1188056 my brother is the only one i have left now i just never expected it to be her nicole as well its really hard
1188057 we won the race hands down and it needs to stay that way
1188058 how dare you include sutherland in this list you guys have no idea how great this organization is you whine about not getting this and that and not having free coffee bull go get a rich foreigner boyfriend and kick yourself out of the call center world
1188059 competition makes everybody better so it should be a great fall camp
1188060 the faster timing throws you off a bit and it is not real smooth after that so i just need to practice and get more reps in i have to have better days
1188061 my form was a little off coach grant came over and worked with me and i was able to get back into the groove a little at the end
1188062 thats not hard to see but with justin coming mitch payne has improved i think his accuracy is impressive so i dont expect it to be an easy decision
1188063 what i can speak to in just watching the returners and the punters and kickers in pre practice on saturday is santiago looks the healthiest he has ever been
1188064 the ball was jumping off his leg with more power than ive ever seen it
1188065 when you consider that now if you kick the ball out of bounds the ball is going to the 40 yard line if justin sorensen or mitch payne can kick the ball out of the end zone where there is no return thats possibly a discrepancy of 20 yards and i am not sure you can place a high enough value on that
1188066 there have been incidents where clinicians have not reported where they have witnessed harm to a patient as a result of another surgeon conducting his or her work
1188067 we cannot allow these circumstances to keep going on where doctors witness harm serious harm on some occasions and not have it reported
1188068 you read the report and its almost a complete replication of what happened in bundaberg
1188069 and the really terrifying part is its still the same attempt by the bureaucracy to say its not our fault lets blame the doctors
1188070 but queensland health are to blame and the only change ive seen is that the bureaucrats are now smarter about how they get back at whistleblowers
1188071 they the commission do make the observation that the changes made would have gone a long way to stop this thing that happened in mackay from occurring again
1188072 what occurred in mackay was a doctor not being properly supervised by who not a bureaucrat a senior doctor
1188073 my mother in law is 86 shes most of the time wheelchair bound
1188074 shes frail bent over and anyone with half a brain could look at her close up and see that shes old frail and needs nurture a lot of tlc
1188075 to subject an 86 year old to something like that is a bit over the top
1188076 about right and 28 per cent thought they were not tough enough home index page
1188077 gas prices are up and the american public has an increased interest in offshore drilling so what does barack obama say we should do to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1188078 the rate of rmb against the usd opened at 6 8163 last week and closed at 6 8420 slumping by 257 basis points
1188079 psychologically its adding to the decline in prices even though it wont have an impact on material supply in the next few years
1188080 fundamentally this wouldnt make a difference until the end of 2010 at the earliest most of these fields dont even have rigs set up yet

1188087 when you eat foods containing more than 200 milligrams of vitamin c a day for example 2 oranges and a serving of broccoli your body prevents blood levels of ascorbate from exceeding a narrow range
1188088 at these high injected doses we hoped to see drug like activity that might be useful in cancer treatment
1188089 these pre clinical data provide the first firm basis for advancing pharmacologic ascorbate in cancer treatment in humans
1188090 clinical and pharmacokinetic studies conducted in the past 12 years showed that oral ascorbate levels in plasma and tissue are tightly controlled in the case series ascorbate was given orally and intravenously but in the trials ascorbate was just given orally it was not realized at the time that only injected ascorbate might deliver the concentrations needed to see an anti tumor effect
1188091 nihs unique translational environment where researchers can pursue intellectual high risk out of the box thinking with high potential payoff enabled us to pursue this work
1188092 but he gave mccain an opening when he predicted that republicans would try to scare people by reminding them he
1188093 researchers at the national institutes of health noted the phenomenon in brain ovarian and pancreatic cancers according to findings published in the august 5 issue of the proceedings of the national academy of sciences
1188094 researchers discovered that high concentrations of ascorbate had anticancer effects in 75 percent of cancer cell lines tested while sparing normal cells
1188095 in addition defense secretary robert gates has authorized the deployment of up to 200 other troops to afghanistan to support the marines that includes eight helicopter crews that could be shifted from iraq if commanders decide
1188096 the senior military official spoke to the associated press on monday on condition of anonymity because the formal announcement has not yet been made

1188101 we believe it is eminently doable and hasnt got the impacts some say it has
1188102 it comes back to the basic decision which we believe is seriously flawed you cant take 60 percent of the rivers flow and say the effect is minor or less than minor
1188103 were deeply concerned and disturbed that our reporter of all of those in that area was asked to move my understanding is that stephen was the only reporter approached and asked to leave the area and the only reporter in that area who is black another reporter who stood up for stephen was then asked to leave
1188104 access to the senator is tightly controlled i would first express regret that your reporter was moved and i can tell you beyond a shadow of a doubt that race had nothing to do with it

1188107 need to create a unique physical bond between the person carrying an id and the data which appears on it is essential in order to fight the worldwide forgeries should we succeed we would be able to create a nationwide database controlled as it should be by the state
1188108 forming such a database would harm the citizens basic right to privacy
1188109 her door was always open and she was always helpful to people
1188110 she just loved mingling with people and she loved the fact that the people were getting out to vote
1188111 she would not merely be in attendance but if there was something that needed to be done she would often see to that
1188112 it depends on whether or not the patient is symptomatic having symptoms or asymptomatic not having symptoms if they feel perfectly well most of the information is useless

1188189 james love and i were the ones who carried claire wilson the pregnant lady i grabbed her ankles and he grabbed her wrists
1188190 there was a big wall there then there were other people they took her farther down the driveway to where the ambulances were waiting

1188198 the second quarter was a strong quarter for st mary year over year we grew production 15 from our retained properties commodity prices were very robust during the quarter which allowed us to generate strong cash flows for the year to date we have exceeded the production goals that we set out at the beginning of the year we are executing well on our business plan and our portfolio is improving every day i am pleased with how we are positioned as we enter the second half of the year

1188205 so it would imply that people who have a mutation in this gene and are susceptible to cancer have inherently regions of their dna which are duplicated or deleted and therefore are unstable
1188206 and that may have something to do with the mechanism by which they develop cancer
1188207 what is also striking is that with each successive generation the cancers tend to occur earlier in age and may also be more aggressive biologically
1188208 so rather than what we have to do now look for everything at every age which becomes an extreme burden on the patients and their families you may be able to say for such and such a person in the family we only need to focus on this tumour type starting from this age
1188209 hope for the future hope that in an lfs family that the legacy of loss will end
1188210 we know cancer to be basically a disease of genetic instability in the cancer cells and all weve done here is use an unusual model to show that that instability is actually present in every cell in every person

1188215 has anyone thought about the economy its not the greatest right now and to add more on peoples taxes when some of us are already on a fixed income its too much
1188216 they have to fill those out and return them if they want some assistance then they have to do that and funding agencies require a certain percentage in that area if we have 28 people theyre going to want to see 24 or so returned
1188217 all i can do is give them my expert opinion ultimately its up to them whether it happens or not
1188218 how do i know what god is calling me to do
1188219 i know what i want and what my parents want but what does god want
1188220 whats this world coming to this is the justice center but theres no justice here another police acquittal he killed that mother he shot her and her child this is just great
1188221 weve had members of our community called to jury duty
1188222 obviously theyve rendered their verdict and thats all we could have asked for a fair concise and attentive look at the evidence they paid attention they listened and this is what theyve rendered
1188223 i dont think any of us are pleased with the fact that this whole incident occurred and the impact its had on the family and others
1188224 i am glad we were able to get through this in a positive way its still going to be a situation a tough situation the community is going to have to deal with
1188225 when was he ever on the side with the community
1188226 hopefully the fbi will pick it up as a community weve got to move on weve got to do better than what were doing
1188227 it was undisputable it was so crystal clear as to what happened inside that house i left that courtroom after closing arguments saying theres no way theyre going to find him guilty just looking at the lifeless faces of the jurors and how desensitized they were to the horror that was described as a community we have to do whatever we can do now people are going to want to stand up and protest youre going to have the so called leadership now wanting to have press conferences and have discussions but they didnt want to come out and support this family
1188228 with the verdicts there are going to be a lot of different viewpoints on this in the community this week and over the next months
1188229 however whether we agree with the verdicts or not we have to remember this is the system and weve got to honor the system and try to work through these problems
1188230 when i think about things that have happened in this city i can say i expected this to happen
1188231 people are tired of it african americans get prison sentences two to three times longer than whites
1188232 if theyd arrested anthony terry the target of the raid tarika wilson would still be alive
1188233 they purchased from him seven times before they arrested him and they could have arrested him earlier that day
1188234 and he chavalia was only facing misdemeanors he should have had some god in him and said you know what i am sorry and i made a mistake i really didnt mean to kill her now you have a family thats going to be torn up and with him being found not guilty hes going to be on the police department tomorrow now how do i go out into the streets and the black the community and tell my brothers let the law prevail how do i tell them that when the law wont even handle their own
1188235 the one unanimous conclusion was that we were grossly disappointed but not surprised by the verdict the justice system does not work for all people in our community and it is time for change we will continue to pursue justice and righteousness by forming a coalition for change we need a new direction and together we can change our community
1188236 do i think theres going to be violence in the community

1188274 at this stage sanzar are unified in new zealand australia and south african teams being involved in super rugby and tri nations going forward
1188275 sanzar needs to remain very very strong particularly in todays rugby environment which is very trying

1188348 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1188349 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1188350 he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact he raised more than one million dollars from big oil just last month

1188446 we talked to him today and we felt that the best thing because hes been out a long time is rather than go two days in a row hes going to go every other day
1188447 he was going to go two on one off but after we talked to him about it he felt good today and rather than take any chances hell throw every other day
1188448 after he throws saturday then well evaluate where were at
1188449 if he progresses and doesnt have any problems then well make a new plan its going to be kind of day by day after that
1188450 he said he felt really good and was very encouraged by how he felt
1188451 weve got to get him on the mound before we even think about a rehab assignment
1188452 if we get him to that point the pitching coach the general manager and the manager will decide
1188453 hes been doing a lot of shoulder conditioning hes been doing a lot of stuff in the weight room with our strength coach hes been doing a lot of core work a lot of leg work a lot of cardio and just getting treatment on his shoulder
1188454 hes been working real hard every day hes working probably two to three hours per day
1188455 the last thing he said to me was give your girls a hug see you next time you are in those were the last words he said to me
1188456 i went from being a ballplayer to a broadcaster i dont think it could been any better to have landed with ernie johnson sr skip caray and pete van wieren each of them taught me something skip helped developed the foundation for what i am as a broadcaster he was a great friend
1188457 we would get letters and they would say why do you guys hate each other
1188458 my family went through some trying times with my daughters premature birth and my cancer
1188459 there wouldnt be a day that went by where skip would say you dont have to come up and drive ill come get you stay at our house at least come out and eat we have an apartment over our garage you and mary dont have to be driving back and forth we were 30 miles apart
1188460 he could be a pain in the butt but he was the generous lovable uncle that you never wanted to see leave he was generous more so than anybody will ever know he worked very hard to cultivate that grumpy side
1188461 i spent more time with skip than i did with my parents i spent 18 years with him
1188462 if they ask me i would tell them yes but they have the last word
1188463 wherever weve put him hes done the job and i just feel like hes earned that right
1188464 and thats what you want a player to say well get him straightened out
1188465 i wasnt looking ahead looking back it was just one pitch at a time its really as simple as that
1188466 if i feel good the next couple of days i will pitch in arizona
1188467 i felt like my mechanics got better as the game progressed
1188468 were going to take it day to day hes feeling a lot better so hopefully hell move in the right direction
1188469 shane loux is a guy who can give us some length and darren oday needs to go down and work on some things right now
1188470 i think it will give shane a chance to work on what he can do up here and give a chance to let oday work on some things
1188471 but if i could have won two or three of those games nobody would think im in a rut
1188472 when i look back i dont feel that im just bad
1188473 there was one bad start on july 29 against the cubs in my career im not a guy that goes seven or eight scoreless innings a lot normally im seven innings two or three runs my good games are all two or three runs thats where ive been but right now im not missing any bats
1188474 his numbers were all star caliber so theyre going to be off a bit
1188475 its hard to keep that you go through little stretches his numbers are off but this just puts him down to the above average pitcher department instead of the all star department things can get turned around very very quickly too a lot of times its a matter of giving him a little bit of a lead
1188476 its just a matter of whether it feels good or not
1188477 we believe perhaps the wholesale investors are in a good position to understand the value of the bonds the quality of the assets and the good position the funds in
1188478 the retail investors may be responding to the difficult market conditions and the emotional drivers around how difficult things are now so by leaving it open for them if they do require emergency funds or do need to leave the fund they can still do that
1188479 need to make the point though that if a large number of retail investors more than normal do decide to leave we may be forced to close the a class as well but certainly hope thats not the case
1188480 i dont think too much about lineup position spots and stuff
1188481 i know tito gets strapped sometimes a little bit and sometimes he needs somebody to fill certain roles i dont mind doing it at all the only time its a major factor is to start the game my mindset is kind of one way try to get on base really no matter where im at in the lineup
1188482 but what i dont want to do is do something like this thats for the benefit of the rest of the year and have him run himself right in the ground by the fifth inning if the trainers say hes ok which they actually think he will be if he needs another day ive got no problem doing that
1188483 coco has swung the bat against this guy a little bit
1188484 i dont know if anyone ever said coco wouldnt play i think it made good sense tonight to let him play and i thought about it a little too
1188485 i think he was one of the truly unique baseball broadcasters in the history of the game
1188486 i went from being a ballplayer to a broadcaster i dont think it couldve been any better to have landed with ernie johnson sr skip caray and pete van wieren each of them taught me something skip helped developed the foundation for what i am as a broadcaster he was a great friend
1188487 my family went through some trying times with my daughters premature birth and my cancer
1188488 he could be a curmudgeon on the air and he could be a pain in the butt but he was the generous lovable uncle that you never wanted to see leave he was generous moreso than anybody will ever know
1188489 he was a great broadcaster and a real good guy
1188490 he had a sense of humor but it was dry real dry he never made himself obvious i just remember him as a friend and a guy who loved his job
1188491 he and i would visit on the phone periodically and his son chip is like a second son to me
1188492 but i mean getting the news last night that he had passed away i was shocked i had no clue and i immediately got on the phone and called chip and talked to chips wife chip and i talked at length today
1188493 its a sad thing i mean 68 years old would be viewed by some people as being old but to me thats young its a tremendous loss to the city of atlanta and to the atlanta braves i mean he loved the atlanta braves he loved being on the job he worked right up until he passed away and hes had all kinds of health problems
1188494 he was smart enough to distance himself from his dad
1188495 when he did the atlanta hawks game he was out of this world he was really good like i said theres a generation that doesnt even know this all they know is skip caray the baseball announcer they dont know skip caray the basketball announcer he did the st louis hawks before they moved and went to atlanta nobody can be as big as harry nobody can but given the fact that he was harrys son skip forged for himself a tremendous career
1188496 i was really shocked although his son chip told me that his dad wasnt doing well but i dont think you ever expect it how can you ever expect it
1188497 you know you lose a buddy a friend a peer its very shocking and weve lost a few bobby murcer and jim kaats wife and skip
1188498 i worked with him a lot we did a lot of games and we socialized from the very beginning from the get go and i thought he was either as talented or more talented than anyone whom ive either worked with or listened to and it sounds very grandiose but he was really talented
1188499 he was quick on the air off the air when he really wanted to do it boy he was really good he had this economy of words which i dont have he could do everything quickly whether it was play by play or just schmoozing he did things quickly easily and he had a great sense of humor
1188500 as only skip caray could say he said boy this is really mickey mouse thats skip carays humor i thought he was more talented and gifted than really anyone else he was really good on the air
1188501 skip said actually it helps me because i can be sarcastic
1188502 he was so sarcastic on the air now im sure i would have loved him when they got good because then the games were more important he was really good really good on the air and really funny thats what made him different he was really funny
1188503 he had a tremendous incredible sense of humor and wit about him
1188504 he could turn a phrase at the drop of a hat that would be applicable to something that was going on on the field or something that happened elsewhere in baseball or to some individual he could stick a verbal barb into someone with the best of em but at the same time he could do it to himself and i think that was one of the things that created the kind of appeal that he had and the kind of following that he had in atlanta
1188505 he was one of my dads first broadcast partners but i broke in with the braves as a broadcaster as well and he was very encouraging to me
1188506 he was one of the only people who took the time to call me after my first major league game with ernie johnson he called me into the press box and said welcome to the big leagues kid ill never forget that he called me like that
1188507 i got skip carays envelope with his meal money in it and i thought wow this is the best job ever i have to get one of these full time i got to stay in skip carays assigned hotel room
1188508 he was always just encouraging he had a wonderful sense of humor i texted chip last night and i told him your dad always made me smile to me its baseball its not brain surgery and he always reminded us that it was fun
1188509 he was a huge inspiration for me he and pete van wieren are probably two of the reasons that im here today there was vin scully growing up but then i moved south as i became older and studied broadcasting those two guys always welcomed me into their booth with advice with guidance those guys are it they couldnt be more different which is great but those guys are the reason that i do what i do today
1188510 popped open a cold one and as i did it had the 1995 world series winning call
1188511 he had a way about him but it was his way and he was true to himself he never bent for anybody else he is baseball in the south hes really going to be missed
1188512 one of the things that was true for me was that i had a lot of questions about broadcasting
1188513 i was also so amazed that when i listened to skip that he and harry were such different personalities on the air that was also a lesson to me because it proved to me that there wasnt one set way to do broadcasting to be successful im pretty touched by his death for a number of reasons one because he was a friend and im sorry that hes gone but i think it also says to me indirectly that im getting up there in age too
1188514 we are overwhelmed by the number of friends colleagues coworkers mlb players and people in the baseball community who have reached out to us and so grateful and touched by their support and prayers we are also deeply appreciative by the outpouring of support from the fans who grew up watching him and shared the ride
1188515 we are deeply saddened by the loss of skip caray whose hall of fame worthy career behind the microphone was instrumental in the growth of turner sports from regional telecaster to national sports broadcaster

1188761 i never run out of paper or ink and easily erase and add notes
1188762 you cant go into best buy and see a tablet pc people had concerns and people very rarely return these units
1188763 it is a fun product to sell and the margins are better than with traditional desktops
1188764 electronic pens can be used to make your handwritten notes available on a computer they usually work fine if you just want to save an image of what youve scribbled however making them recognize your handwriting and turn it into text is more difficult
1188765 there is probably no better gadget for taking notes in class except perhaps a tablet pc which allows you to write on the screen however tablet pcs are expensive and more difficult to use
1188766 a policy and privacy logjam has constricted some of the consumer uptake of these services
1188767 their approach is build a system and well find out about privacy after the fact
1188768 the immigration system isnt working when communities are terrorized by ice immigration raids when nursing mothers are torn from their babies
1188769 this is the kind of question that is available for a yes or no answer either you support it or you oppose it yes or no
1188770 yes but i am going to be fighting for comprehensive immigration reform
1188771 what theyre going to try is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a
1188772 playing the race card from the bottom of the deck
1188773 slimy foul poisonous designed to exploit the hostility anxiety and resentment of the many white americans who are still freakishly hung up on the idea of black men rising above their station and becoming
1188774 why is there a two speed justice system when they steal his scooter they are full of zeal when it hits my car there is less zeal
1188775 has just said that he wants to convert to judaism before marrying his fianc e a jew and heiress of the founders of darty he will go far in this life the little one
1188776 a close collaborator of jean sarkozy contacted me to tell me that the families of jean sarkozy and his fianc e had been outraged and were contemplating a lawsuit
1188777 the former army scientist who was the prime suspect in the deadly 2001 anthrax mailings agreed friday to take 5 82 million from the government to settle his claim that the justice department and the fbi invaded his privacy and ruined his career
1188778 there is not a scintilla of evidence that would indicate that dr hatfill had anything to do with this
1188779 migrants are coming home from u s with dollars ideas and little patience for the old way of doing things
1188780 in isolated pockets throughout mexico especially in far flung rural areas groups of migrants are entering the political arena for many returning migrants the lessons they learned in places such as are guiding their forays into politics before they left mexico for the united states many of them were the poorest and often the towns and villages they are returning with dollars ideas and little patience for the old way of doing things
1188781 seir ben tez left this remote town high in the sierra madre mountains 12 years ago in hopes of escaping a harsh life in its dusty fields he traded dramatic mountain views and grinding poverty for an apartment in austin and a job in a tool factory he spent eight years in the united states venturing as far as florida and nebraska before returning home with enough money to build a house ben tez 28 also came back filled with new ideas of how luvianos in the state of mexico should be governed he is considering a run for mayor joining a wave of politically active migrants who many in mexico believe have the potential to reshape the countryside i want to create jobs so that said ben tez who works for luvianos city government and peppers his conversation with references to austins flea markets and riverside drive restaurants
1188782 this is very suggestive that there is a fundamental change going on in the electorate
1188783 obviously these are not good numbers for the party to be looking at democrats have always had extremely broad multifaceted registration programs
1188784 i think the key in this one is where do all these new independent voters break
1188785 i think right now youve got a guy in western pennsylvania saying i am really disgusted right now and im not going to register as a republican anymore but i really dont want this guy obama elected
1188786 i think nationally and here people are kind of tired of the way this administration has been conducting the policies of this country
1188787 i guess jerry yang didnt come out of the meeting as unscathed as it seemed
1188788 we were surprised at the very high vote counts that were pro jerry yang
1188789 certainly the final results seemed very different from the exit polls
1188790 it seems odd that fewer shares would be voted this year compared to last when theres been such additional scrutiny on the company in the wake of the dealings with microsoft and carl icahn
1188791 the independent inspector of elections certified the results of the election and yahoo accurately announced those results
1188792 yahoo did not participate in the execution of the votes and was not a party to any errors which may have been made either by a voting institution or a proxy processing intermediary acting on behalf of banks brokers and institutions
1188793 capital research global investors asked broadridge financial to double check the votes it transmitted to yahoo on its behalf
1188794 i think jerry yang is still firmly in place until some deviation happens from the plan yahoo has set forth
1188795 the said cancer was detected through an mri ordered by a doctor and is not life threatening

1188799 ive been to the olympics ive been to every stage there possibly is in this sport
1188800 the only one i havent been successful at in my opinion is the olympics
1188801 the way that im introduced at appearances that fact that they dont say olympic champion bothers me

1188804 i know youve been stressed about work but youve been making me feel like if i dont have the patience or interest to listen to your consistent ranting about your horrible coworkers then i dont love you or something right now you demanding an apology is a joke to me youre shifting the responsibility away from yourself and youre stressed and you have things going on and i feel like you have nowhere else to go but to me maybe roni too angry frustrated upset sad mad furious with nothing but a horrible attitude a mouth that cant stop talking shit about your coworkers and as the girlfriend of someone who is feeling completely overwhelmed by stuff thats out of his control but is being made to feel like if he doesnt stop everything hes doing and apologize than hes not the loving boyfriend he once was maybe im just assuming maybe im just going off of the attitude i get from you if i dont react how you expect me to now if i felt like you just wanted me to listen to you then this would be a different situation ive done nothing but sit there and hear you out and help you decipher the situation and told you where i draw the line as far as hearing about your work stress goes i cant take the frustration and feeling like you cant or wont do anything but run away from it or trash talk those who supposedly cause it youre not handling this situation like an adult youre avoiding all responsibility about it by making me and roni and cheryl and manny and whoever else your scapegoats in this battle when all it really comes down to is that youre frustrated about your job and you need to do something about it once and for all i dont even know why im typing all of this out i dont mean to encourage you right now to be more upset i just mean to tell you that im on the tipping point and i regret thinking that maybe when you got back you would be a lot more tolerant of your life and the people around you who dont or cant completely agree with you 100 about things that really arent as important as they are to you zip i honestly dont know if its your job or what thats killing this but its incredibly hard for me to tolerate at this point i was really hoping things would be different but youve only become less tolerant i didnt even think it possible and more worked up do you remember how badly i was hoping things would be different when you came back does it mean getting pissed off and threatening to leave your job no you do that pretty much once a week its nothing new at all im having a hard time setting boundaries and judging what im supposed to be responsible for but i am truly feeling responsible for your job and your general wellbeing at this point my saying quit or dont quit seems to be whats going to determine it making me feel horrible for trying to help you calm down yesterday afternoon and encouraging you to not quit what was that i understand your freaking frustration jenn but ranting and trashing your coworkers is going to do nothing but make me want to leave the room yeah maybe its my fault for not being tolerant enough to listen to you complaining about the same people all day every day just try to understand the frustration in my feeling like its going to be the same thing at the next job you get it was like that when you worked at arcadia too no one worked as hard as you there either if this email gets you as pissed off as i think it will stop and reconsider the fact that your boyfriend is trying to tell you how he feels in hope that youll understand and calm yourself down i love you zippy this borderline thing is making me want to check into a mental health clinic
1188805 its fun to make people think about what music is worth
1188806 gostaria de repassar a todos um pouco sobre o andamento do famoso porto cinco estrelas porto este em que acontecem algumas coisas que s vendo pra acreditar
1188807 estiva papa siri m os e p s do porto de itaja
1188808 quem diz o que quer ouve o que n o quer
1188809 hey stupid do you know how much you weigh sit down
1188810 uses the weakness the helplessness of the palestinian patients in gaza in trying to pressure them to be collaborators
1188811 then they start to be about relatives people in the street people in the neighborhood then hes asked about power structures within military organizations in the gaza strip
1188812 if you want to go to the hospital take my private cellphone number talk to me and give me information about people
1188813 were not talking about a friendly neighbor at the moment and there are numerous cases of those who present security threats
1188814 the government has documented at least 20 cases of palestinians who tried to abuse their medical access to carry out terrorist attacks
1188815 israeli authorities halted the process however as they received information that they were being arrested by hamas and that their lives were in immediate danger
1188816 iraq will not be represented at the 2008 beijing olympic games and iraqi athletes will not be able to compete at these games
1188817 we deeply regret this outcome which severely harms the iraqi olympic and sports movement and the iraqi athletes
1188818 we feel like this is an unjust attack on iraq at a time when we need the worlds support
1188819 sports is the only thing that brings unity to the iraqis and brings us happiness and now it has been taken away
1188820 if we have done something wrong why havent we been charged with a crime or arrested
1188821 ongoing political interference by the government within the sports movement in iraq
1188822 iraq and our strategic position in the middle east in ruins risking a wider war in the near future
1188823 amounted to a real time test for a future commander in chief
1188824 america passed that test i believe my judgment passed that test and i believe senator obamas failed
1188825 a pretty good timetable as we should have horizons for withdrawal but they have to be based on conditions on the ground
1188826 the american people are looking for a serious debate about the way forward in iraq and afghanistan and angry false accusations will do nothing to accomplish that goal
1188827 so far i think we have not seen the kind of political reconciliation thats going to bring about long term stability in iraq but theres no doubt that security has improved
1188828 we did not want for this law to be a reason for tension or poisoning the political atmosphere but unfortunately this took place
1188829 the vote is a useless act other than to delay and paralyze
1188830 we have lost the chance to conduct the elections this year
1188831 this is the first time to use a secret vote in an important law like this we believe its illegal
1188832 the kurds understandably are not excited about being a minority the history here runs very very deep the last time they were a minority they suffered a great deal at the hands of some of the same people that would be taking office
1188833 i guess jerry yang didnt come out of the meeting as unscathed as it seemed
1188834 we were surprised at the very high vote counts that were pro jerry yang
1188835 certainly the final results seemed very different from the exit polls
1188836 it seems odd that fewer shares would be voted this year compared to last when theres been such additional scrutiny on the company in the wake of the dealings with microsoft and carl icahn
1188837 the independent inspector of elections certified the results of the election and yahoo accurately announced those results
1188838 yahoo did not participate in the execution of the votes and was not a party to any errors which may have been made either by a voting institution or a proxy processing intermediary acting on behalf of banks brokers and institutions
1188839 capital research global investors asked broadridge financial to double check the votes it transmitted to yahoo on its behalf
1188840 i think jerry yang is still firmly in place until some deviation happens from the plan yahoo has set forth
1188841 i accept this gavel in the spirit of partnership not partisanship and i look forward to working with you minority leader john boehner and the republicans in congress for the good of the american people
1188842 when you win an election you win the majority and what is the power of the speaker to set the agenda the power of recognition and i am not giving the gavel away to anyone
1188843 it always made me sad when i heard women reply to the question what do you do
1188844 my message to women is to place a higher value on the experience of being a mother and homemaker
1188845 assumed that the only thing i could be doing at five in the afternoon was cooking
1188846 the way in which the press and the public too examines a woman candidates clothing and hair down to the millimeter
1188847 how could he ever have thought i would pick them up
1188848 after we were married he once asked me to iron a shirt that didnt happen either
1188849 their message was only we know the secret sauce for success you dont and you never will
1188850 its going to take a little more time and a little more disruption before the secret sauce attitude completely disappears
1188851 i consider my role in politics as an extension of my role as a mom
1188852 let us all stand together to move our country forward seeking common ground for the common good we are from different parties but we serve one country
1188853 the most beautiful building in the world because of what it represents the voice of the people
1188854 could never live anyplace that was made available because of the election of richard nixon
1188855 who hadnt been born yet often says to me that she knows everything she needs to know about me by hearing that story
1188856 would not directly infringe plaintiffs exclusive rights to reproduce and publicly perform their copyrighted works
1188857 cable operators would no longer need to provide a unique piece of hardware for each individual subscriber in order to offer dvr functionality
1188858 this is a tremendous victory for consumers which will allow us to make dvrs available to many more people faster and less expensively than would otherwise be possible
1188859 we appreciate the courts perspective that from the standpoint of existing copyright law remote storage dvrs are the same as the traditional dvrs that are in use today
1188860 i dont believe that understandings that will include jerusalem can be reached this year
1188861 but we havent even started to negotiate the issue of jerusalem yet instead of letting the weakest link of the chain destroy the whole process we are proposing that we find a mechanism to deal with jerusalem in 2009
1188862 whoever thinks it is possible to live with 270 000 arabs in jerusalem must take into account that there will be more bulldozers more tractors and more cars carrying out terror attacks
1188863 its coming out now because were getting closer to the endgame
1188864 we do believe al qaida is doing some measure of re assessment regarding the continued viability of its fight in iraq and whether iraq should remain the focus of its efforts
1188865 its not known yet whether he would come back or not
1188866 the rumors now are saying that he escaped and this is not true he just traveled
1188867 he will come back to iraq anytime he wants like he has done before
1188868 he took care of his six brothers and sisters like a father they all adored him and looked up to him so much he was a parent figure in their lives
1188869 his room is covered in usc posters he wanted to go to school there more than anything
1188870 nearly all of the 4 200 acre park is covered with chaparral and landscape that can become volatile

1188888 the hardware guys couldnt make a chip until there was software out there we had a stalemate
1188889 think of it as a key to unlock the next era of computing the many core era
1188890 its a bit like a supercomputer on a chip really the sky is the limit in terms of what software makers can do with it
1188891 it is important for industry to work in tandem with academia to unleash the immense power of parallel computing
1188892 were quickly moving the computing industry to a many core world
1188893 to to kick start an industry wide effort to create and optimize software for the dozens hundreds and thousands of cores expected to power future computers
1188894 in order to help him get the nomination of his party
1188895 senator obama just views this war as another political issue with which he can change positions
1188896 it seems to me that obama would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
1188897 i think john is treading on some very thin ground here when he impugns motives and when we start to get into youre less patriotic than me
1188898 hagel said on john mccain very much johns better than that
1188899 john mccain is an honorable man running an increasingly dishonorable campaign
1188900 i think a lot of people are wondering what happened to the civil campaign john mccain said he was going to run
1188901 i say that it was very clear that a decision had to be made and i made it when it wasnt popular he made a decision which was popular with his base and that is a fundamental difference
1188902 im not prepared to see the sacrifice of so many brave young americans lost because senator obama just views this war as another political issue with which he can change positions
1188903 made time to go to the gym but canceled a visit with wounded troops
1188904 seems the pentagon wouldnt allow him to bring cameras john mccain is always there for our troops mccain country first
1188905 triggered then a concern that maybe our visit was going to be perceived as political
1188906 it would be totally inappropriate for him on a campaign trip to go to a military hospital and use those soldiers as props
1188907 i think people make a judgment by what we do and what we dont do he certainly found time to do other things if i had been told by the pentagon that i couldnt visit those troops and i was there and wanted to be there i guarantee you there would have been a seismic event
1188908 churlish and unlike mccain and hardly will resonate with the swing voters who are going to decide this election
1188909 theyre doing it because the candidate and the campaign is not happy with where they are and theyre lashing out
1188910 the defeat was due to mismanagement by the speaker and his deputies and then the sudden sharp rejection by the kurds
1188911 i think everyone now expects that elections will be delayed until next year
1188912 we cannot simply pull off fair and transparent elections in a day and a night
1188913 the governor is pushing republicans and democrats to come to the table immediately and reach a compromise because of the looming cash crisis we face
1188914 this compromise must include budget reform that prevents our state from being in this position
1188915 they needed someone high profile with engineering talent and certainly this guy fits the bill
1188916 the only downside is that he doesnt necessarily have any consumer products expertise
1188917 in terms of actual products hitting the street youre not going to see jhas impact before 2010
1188918 probably his biggest impact will be the level and type of engineering talent he will attract to the company over time
1188919 motorola will only be successful if this new team creates a complete solution that includes hardware software and services similar to apple
1188920 while the iphone is a great phone its real value comes from its software applications and services
1188921 although creating slick phones is one part of the success equation apples success will force even traditional handset makers to think harder about the software and services angle if they are to really compete with apple head on
1188922 theres a tremendous opportunity here to take this business to the next level
1188923 the thought a while back was that demand was going to hold up pretty well in the face of higher prices but it finally hit a wall
1188924 it forces prices to overshoot on the upside but it also forces prices to overshoot on the downside
1188925 were probably going to see prices drop much further than people anticipate
1188926 gasoline didnt rise as fast as oil on the way up so i wouldnt expect that it would fall as much on the way back down
1188927 and the oil thats being priced today on the futures market isnt going to reach the pumps for a while
1188928 fusionreactor coldfusion server healthcare and whats new in version 3
1188929 a group of practitioners is losing an important skill it is like going to war with fewer weapons at your disposal
1188930 you know weve been looking forward to that for a while
1188931 were very excited about the opportunity but at the same time we understand the process of it
1188932 and thats part of the enjoyment of it the hard work we put in the preparation that we put in that makes it that much more enjoyable
1188933 you hear it so many times its cheesy but the road to redemption thats really what it is
1188934 we understand the journey that were on and we want to savor every moment of it
1188935 given the history and great tradition between what was the ussr and now is the russian national team and of course the united states team a game of this nature is always interesting
1188936 thank goodness we live in a time in which sports rules and we can look at the game and enjoy the game on a sporting level without any other agendas going on
1188937 i know the question about playing on the russian national team for jay is a very difficult question
1188938 but after the european championship last year russian fans said he was the most russian of anybody
1188939 youve got a situation where senator obama has been incessantly criticizing the iraqi government for 18 months
1188940 now heres something he thinks can work to his political advantage and so hes embracing it while at the same time rejecting the considered military judgment of those who made the successes of the surge possible like gen david h petraeus and gen raymond t odierno
1188941 andy warhol said we get our 15 minutes of fame
1188942 ive already had an hour and a half i mean im so overexposed im making paris hilton look like a recluse
1188943 there were still nine climbers above these ropes which meant they had to spend the whole night out in the open
1188944 at the end of saturday 11 people were confirmed dead
1188945 thanks to almighty allah the rescue operation has started this morning
1188946 sure 90 of science fiction is crud thats because 90 of everything is crud

1188950 everything from love and family to teen smoking and community service
1188951 go around put up signs shake some hands see some of the important people in the village
1188952 the campaign is treating alaska as a key battleground state
1188953 its a tough state to move but were making a play
1188954 if theres any year where a democrat can win alaska this is the year
1188955 one of the most dangerous and urgent threats this nation has ever faced
1188956 the strategic oil reserve exists for americas national security strategy not barack obamas election strategy
1188957 i think he does still have issues with the jewish community
1188958 in the end i think hes going to do as well as any democratic nominee with the jewish community but people still have to feel more comfortable with him
1188959 there was some very serious thought that went into this
1188960 there is an extraordinary amount of attention and its for good reason
1188961 people believe senator obama is going to win the election and become the next president of the united states
1188962 as impressive and phenomenal as the senators campaign has been he just hasnt been on the scene as long as others have been
1188963 and the jewish community is one that has a special feeling when it comes to roots
1188964 i would think its several million already and millions to go
1188965 i couldnt let him go not after seeing how far hed come
1188966 if he is chosen then france will be delighted and if its somebody else then france will be the friend of the united states of america
1188967 i want to say to barack obama that the french have been following with passion the election campaign in the united states
1188968 because the united states are a great democracy and that its fascinating to watch whats happening there
1188969 we need friends who are independent but who are true friends and you have to know that here in europe here in france were watching with great interest what youre doing
1188970 where was gonzalez last year when cal football needed the heimlich maneuver
1188971 it would be nice if the german government would focus on strengthening its contacts to us rather than already beginning to look for our successors
1188972 our position is that each candidate is going to have to make decisions on their own about their campaigns
1188973 little sympathy for the brandenburg gate being used for electioneering and has expressed her doubts about the idea
1188974 if you run against a self funder the laws no longer going to help you out it will be potentially game changing
1188975 it is a very difficult situation it is a challenge we are doing what we have to do
1188976 he can meet voters while we are trying to meet voters and raise money
1188977 he said that the deteriorating security situation is very very real and that weve got a lot of work to do as it relates to that
1188978 i think he heard and saw a lot of that today
1188979 the word is well and truly out now that this race is a great event and it will be on the yachting calendar of many ocean racers in the coming years
1188980 the outgoing tide really made the decision for us there was no wind and we just wanted to get ashore
1188981 we had a great race but it was time to join the party so the engine was turned on and in we motored
1188982 the moral message must be a much broader message what we need really is racial justice and urban policy and jobs and health care
1188983 rocks humor is so effective because he is just as hard on whites as on blacks thats a part of the routine obama has not yet adopted
1188984 we need them to realize that what makes you a man is not the ability to have a child its the courage to raise one
1188985 i think people misunderstand i disagree that hes talking down to black people the civil rights movement of the 21st century must be government accountability and personal responsibility
1188986 has spoken and written for many years about the issue of parental responsibility
1188987 if black people kill black people every day why not have a week and kill white people
1188988 if you believe you should pay more taxes i am the wrong candidate for you senator obama is your man
1188989 the choice in this election is stark and simple senator obama will raise your taxes i wont i will cut them where i can jobs are the most important thing our economy creates when you raise taxes in a bad economy you eliminate jobs im not going to let that happen
1188990 are very much the same as those we have seen from the bush administration
1188991 from the standpoint of the democratic party i would think it would make the most sense to leave it alone
1188992 throughout my life i have always taken my deep and abiding love for this country as a given
1188993 it was how i was raised it was what propelled me into public service it is why i am running for president and yet at times over the last 16 months my patriotism has been challenged at times as a result of my own carelessness more often as a result of the desire by some to score political points and raise fears about who i am and what i stand for
1188994 i dont think getting in a fighter plane and getting shot down is a qualification to become president
1188995 who have endured physical torment in service to our country
1188996 and let me also add that no one should ever devalue that service especially for the sake of a political campaign and that goes for supporters on both sides
1188997 at times in the past democrats have given the impression that they would rather not have the debate barack would prefer to engage in the debate i am pleased that he is
1188998 senator obama please vote no on telecom immunity get fisa right
1188999 i know that the fisa bill that passed the house is far from perfect i wouldnt have drafted the legislation like this and it does not resolve all of the concerns that we have about
1189000 but i also believe that the compromise bill is far better than the protect america act that i voted against last year the exclusivity provision makes it clear to any president or telecommunications company that no law supersedes the authority of the fisa court
1189001 i know what we start here in this field in unity will end on the steps of the capitol when barack obama takes the oath of office as our next president
1189002 i dont think its at all unknown among this audience that this was a hard fought primary campaign
1189003 but today and every day going forward we stand shoulder to shoulder for the ideals we share the values we cherish and the country we love
1189004 as someone who took the same historic journey as senator clinton who watched her campaign and debate i know firsthand how good she is how tough she is how passionate she is how committed she is to the causes that brought all of us here today
1189005 i know senator obama ive served with him in the senate for four years ive campaigned with and against him for lots of months
1189006 so ive had a front row seat to his candidacy and ive seen his strength and his determination his grace and his grit
1189007 for anyone who voted for me and who is now considering not voting or voting for senator mccain i strongly urge you to reconsider i urge you to remember what we are standing for in this election
1189008 yes my butt its not funny it really does hurt
1189009 yes ive been tense lately and i was really tense yesterday in particular
1189010 are you saying that youre carrying your tension in your butt
1189011 you should do something about that butt clenching tension of yours
1189012 thats right my butt pain is hilarious i cant even sit down on the hard toilet seat today but its hilarious
1189013 im sure you could but no thank you i dont think so
1189014 now i know what youll look like walking when youre really old
1189015 if theres one thing you can see about this court it is that it still sits on a knifes edge
1189016 the blockbuster cases the really big cases have now brought into very sharp focus how closely divided the court is on the really large and philosophically charged issues before the court
1189017 the sharpest possible focus how important the court is going to be i should think and should hope in the upcoming election debate
1189018 i think on any measure one would have to agree this is a more conservative court than was the court a couple of years ago because on any measure justice alito is a more conservative justice than was justice oconnor
1189019 garbage collectors would inspect san francisco residents trash to make sure pizza crusts arent mixed in with chip bags or wine bottles under a proposal by mayor gavin newsom and if residents or businesses dont separate the coffee grounds from the newspapers they would face fines of up to 1 000 and eventually could have their garbage service stopped the plan to require proper sorting of refuse would be the nations first mandatory recycling and composting law it would direct garbage collectors to inspect the trash to make sure it is put into the right blue black or green bin according to a draft of the legislation prepared by the citys department of the environment

1189031 i think its a very typical first day of training camp
1189032 its a reminder that its hard its tough and of how much work we have ahead of us you come in and do a great job in summer program of working out and conditioning but really there is no conditioning like going out and playing its different our guys are much better off than a year ago
1189033 we may as well just set a date as to when the next question will be asked about them were going to rep them and to roll them and see how they do there will be days where ross looks better than taylor and days where taylor looks better than ross we will see how it shakes out
1189034 this could be the hottest practice ive ever been through in my life
1189035 i didnt realize it got this hot down here for most part i had good day but once again its just the first day i had to get the rust off it completely changes from summer workouts to training camp practice its a totally different style
1189036 competition is great in anything our entire society is built on it anytime you have it it brings out the best were all competing whoever it is will have earned it

1189038 an iranian spy might be killed in lebanon a hezbollah guy in syria but not a syrian in syria with a sniper
1189039 suleiman was certainly one of a handful of people who helped assad control syria
1189040 this is a source of embarrassment for the regime especially coming after the nuclear plant bombing and the mughniyeh assassination
1189041 the application should clarify the purpose time route and process of the activity the posters and slogans to be used the estimated number of participants and the specific use of sound facilities
1189042 it must be stressed that citizens must respect and not harm others freedom and rights and must not harm national social and collective interests
1189043 all of us in the olympic family hope that the beijing games will help the healing process in china and deepen the worlds knowledge of this remarkable country
1189044 but i had also to survive because i was getting snow blind
1189045 the olympic torch relay outside china has been interrupted and sabotaged by a small number of separatists for tibet independence and they have damaged the image of china and damaged the sanctity of the olympic flame
1189046 the chinese in the overseas chinese community have shown outstanding solidarity they went to the streets to protect the olympic flame and the olympic idea and they have demonstrated to all the peace loving people across the world a just call for peace and friendship
1189047 im very proud of what they have done to protect the olympic flame
1189048 i think the majority of the overseas chinese have very deep feelings towards china i do not know what people you are referring to those who support the olympic games in beijing but do not support the chinese government
1189049 during the time of the olympic games we embrace all the friendly people from across the world and we welcome their participation in the olympic games

1189164 we have to overcome our problems with reliability and with our tyres performance
1189165 but for sure reliability is the biggest thing because we cannot accept to have these kind of problems even if it was only 10 kilometres from the end
1189166 we cannot have this problem of reliability because we are paying too much of a price for it on the other hand qualifying is crucial and the difference today was really the fact that on one side we were able to jump in front and do our race as we were able to do and on the other hand in the first part in the middle of the field knowing that it was really impossible to do something in spite of having the right pace
1189167 what we need to improve is looking ahead above all at the next grand prix where maybe there will be tricky conditions in terms of temperature in terms of the situation weather something like that
1189168 for sure we need to prepare our cars and tyre set up maybe in a different way because we saw what we suffered for example in germany
1189169 we spilt about half a litre of fuel and it was put out quickly and then we switched to our other rig to fuel the car as normal
1189170 it seems it may be a coincidence but that is all as far as we know the refuelling rig did not go on square and that was it but we need to know more really
1189171 i think we have to look at it very carefully when you have high temperatures you get a bit of pressure coming out of the fuel tank and you cannot cool it down everyone was struggling with it and we did as much as we could but it is a temperamental thing and we cannot adjust the rigs they are standard kit

1189192 my friends dont really complain except about tucking in shirts
1189193 as my mom said uniforms dont give kids a chance to express individuality but some control of the wardrobe keeps it from getting out of hand
1189194 kindergarten changed from years ago when it was mostly socialization to now when they learn to read
1189195 our goal every year is to get more kids reading at grade level
1189196 right now were doing reading assessments so we can accurately place students at the appropriate reading level
1189197 i have a new teacher mrs solomon she seems like a really nice woman some kids say she was mean but i dont believe them
1189198 another great thing is the crane district is starting to build uniform closets that provide free shirts
1189199 it varies from school to school but parents can phone the front office to learn more we started asking for donations last year and will continue our uniform drive but the kids look just great very sharp
1189200 a time like this when interpersonal relations are so tense and unfortunately toxic with levels of distrust and dishonor ive never seen some of the younger people are bailing and thats not good because none of us old farts have the strength anymore
1189201 sales calls and even markets arent the same anymore no matter where they are and the people are on edge all the time with permanent frowns this industry isnt fun anymore and i would leave if i didnt like it so much
1189202 in my position i just cant pick up and leave but would if i could
1189203 sustainability really means something economically and assures a more surefire path to surviving
1189204 but even so ive never seen people so dyspeptic and bummed out like a bad case of economic influenza this too shall pass
1189205 yeh it will get better but it will really be different and that difference will bring a new wave of both positive and negative tension getting out can surely seem like the path for some

1189207 it has dramatically changed the way we run our lives
1189208 until recently universities and professional societies have ducked out of this because they dont want to be lightning rods for extremists
1189209 far fewer incidents of harassment have been directed at our faculty
1189210 perpetrators must be stopped using whatever means necessary and the use of force is a morally righteous tactic furthermore it is the most likely tactic to be effective in halting these atrocities
1189211 with a broad brush it makes everyone who cares about animals look like an extremist and that plays into the hands of people who exploit them they are able to discredit what we do
1189212 valuations are still way out of line and price to earnings ratios are too high
1189213 while the china entrepreneurial environment has come a long way the anything goes style is unhealthy and unsustainable in the short term you will see a lot of high valuations and so called success stories this will build up into a false bubble with dire consequences
1189214 we continue to see strong growth and government backing of entrepreneurship
1189215 inflation and the global economic downturn remain tight credit provides an advantage for vc and private equity to pick deals in china

1189230 we can inform the residents of what they can do and what they shouldnt do
1189231 our main role is to reduce crime watch out and report any thing suspicious
1189232 the last time it happened they tampered with the phone and electricity lines

1189240 she was really interesting it was good to hear from her

1189253 and so 22 friends of chet showed up on a beautiful saturday afternoon on the top floor of the columbarium in san francisco to celebrate the legendary rock impresario and symbol of the summer of love who died on june 25 2005
1189254 chet was loving and giving and music is what kept him livin

1189259 we want to do for 3d what youtube did for video
1189260 workers will use web3d to teach and learn innovate collaboratively communicate and network interact with and present information and manage real world systems
1189261 has beaten previous download figures for sun apps after only three days
1189262 he may have found a loophole in the political reform act that needs to be closed
1189263 here is money being spent to influence the legislature and we dont know how much or how its being spent
1189264 we strictly do public information and outreach we dont talk to legislators about bills we dont ask people for votes
1189265 the publics inclination is to distrust politicians and each time we find some new scheme for moving special interest money around that distrust is confirmed and deepened
1189266 if its not required to be disclosed it should be
1189267 i havent seen them do anything that we havent agreed with
1189268 we have been known as having the best platform but not the best client
1189269 our client has been a weak spot but with the new client people are immediately going to be able to pick it up and know how to work it
1189270 the hardware guys couldnt make a chip until there was software out there we had a stalemate
1189271 think of it as a key to unlock the next era of computing the many core era
1189272 its a bit like a supercomputer on a chip really the sky is the limit in terms of what software makers can do with it
1189273 it is important for industry to work in tandem with academia to unleash the immense power of parallel computing
1189274 were quickly moving the computing industry to a many core world
1189275 to to kick start an industry wide effort to create and optimize software for the dozens hundreds and thousands of cores expected to power future computers
1189276 the other side of the crash over and out of control
1189277 ideally we like to give him a bit longer between races and although the track was a dead five it had a fair bit of fill after the meeting a fortnight ago and he didnt seem to like it he will appreciate the short break and hopefully the tracks will be firmer
1189278 i love going to the country races and now i have the perfect excuse to go to as many race days as possible
1189279 country races are one of victorias best kept secrets the setting is picturesque you can actually see the horses up close and the atmosphere is more relaxed
1189280 dressing for the country races is far more fun too you can wear a beautiful dress and hat but dont have to wear six inch heels to look the part
1189281 she prefers the sting out of the ground for sure
1189282 unfortunately there are not a lot of options around for her at the moment and i am considering heading to bairnsdale with her this sunday she will jump a bit in class but there arent too many other races in her distance range
1189283 im not doing too much with him but he had a fortnight in the paddock and it did him a lot of good he really is all the better for it and hes just ticking over at the moment
1189284 they have stuck with this horse and also supported me very well they are great owners and it is very pleasing to see their perseverance rewarded
1189285 it has taken this horse a while but he has always promised to win a race i thought he was a good thing beaten at moe last year and then he went to sale and ran second to a good one from the hayes stable that went on to win in town
1189286 ive always said he works better than a maiden and now he has broken through we hope he can go on with it
1189287 it took avitt 18 starts to break his maiden and he went on and won three prime ministers cups on the gold coast 1982 84 so they can go on with it with confidence i just hope this fella does
1189288 we had to account for 30 years of sins in terms of not maintaining our data
1189289 when i joined i used to tease everybody that the erp around here was microsoft excel everybody laughed but there was a lot of truth to that statement
1189290 they had a couple of microsoft access database apps which in reality only allowed them to put in a larger amount of records and there was no such thing as a business analyst at ach
1189291 kludge together how to price a consumer order and a commercial order which took a lot of manual labor and workarounds
1189292 historically it was very difficult to get one version of the truth youd run a batch routine ten minutes later and get different numbers
1189293 when should we focus on change management and dont say day 1
1189294 project requirements change for a variety of reasons and schedules and budgets change during the lifetime of the project based on better information as to effort complexity and interdependencies
1189295 this would not be an issue except that project sponsors judge project success in terms of schedule budget meet requirements

1189309 nearly all men can stand adversity but if you want to test a mans character give him power
1189310 my father thought the whole idea was absurd he refused to identify the stream he had crossed at bomako where it is no deeper he said than a man is high with the great widespread waters of the vast niger delta distances as measured in miles had no meaning for him maps are liars he told me briefly from his tone of voice i could tell that i had offended him in some way not known to me at the time the things that hurt one do not show on a map with my big map talk i had effaced the magnitude of his cargo laden heat weighted tracks
1189311 its like this i start here with the intention of reaching here in an experiment say to increase the speed of the atlantic cable but when ive arrived part way in my straight line i meet with a phenomenon and it leads me off in another direction and develops into a phonograph
1189312 was in good spirits when i spoke with him a short time ago
1189313 he says hell be ok and is looking forward to a full recovery
1189314 the vehicle went off the edge of the road and flipped several times
1189315 really scarlett and i have run out of lines to say about that
1189316 were calling woody to give us some material people love that subject the only thing which is honest the set was very crowded that day but i dont have anything else to tell you about it
1189317 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1189318 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1189319 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the some straight talk
1189320 he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact he raised more than one million dollars from big oil just last month
1189321 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1189322 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires
1189323 the decision to resort to the use of force was a careless blunder to say the least made over cautionary advice of the u n secretariat here in
1189324 upper echelons of the secretariat here in new york to consider the issue of individual responsibility
1189325 dialogue was continuing what happened happened out of the blue it was 5 a m 4 a m in the morning they stormed the house mostly occupied by women they started breaking doors and twisting arms
1189326 at some point you have to go in and take back the courthouse
1189327 no other guy would do this for you im the best bf
1189328 im so hungry i could eat a sandwich from a gas station
1189329 to our knowledge this is the first time a planetary scale social network has been available to validate the well known 6 degrees of separation finding by travers and milgram
1189330 via the lens provided on the world by messenger we find that there are about 7 degrees of separation among people they wrote
1189331 to me it was pretty shocking what were seeing suggests there may be a social connectivity constant for humanity
1189332 people have had this suspicion that we are really close but we are showing on a very large scale that this idea goes beyond folklore
1189333 many many firms are na ve when they enter into the chinese market and dont even think about the fact that wages are increasing there
1189334 someone who just wants to produce t shirts is more likely to go to vietnam or africa
1189335 thats why were advising a lot of our customers to consider production in germany
1189336 by then you might have already lost them to an automobile factory next door that pays more
1189337 it looks like you are having a blast when we stayed in london we stayed
1189338 well i reckon the boys bathroom is a step above the bushes in the park

1189400 its difficult to get a firm hand around this stuff but my intuition based on observation is that weve hit the peak of tcfs problems
1189401 and things will get better going forward in general in the third and fourth quarter and into 2009
1189402 i dont think bill can come in and wave a magic wand
1189403 lynn nagorske was under a lot of pressure and he was worn down bill will bring a new level of energy but there isnt going to be any big change in strategy and direction
1189404 they used to be able to take back houses and not lose money now theyre competing against all the houses on the market because of the subprime lenders and bad competitors and there is nostalgia inside and outside of tcf for the good old days but their model is no longer anywhere near unique and its not as profitable
1189405 sign me up for this class and lets broadcast it on mogulus
1189406 therefore i tell you do not worry about your life what you will eat or drink or about your body what you will wear is not life more important than food and the body more important than clothes look at the birds of the air they do not sow or reap or store away in barns and yet your heavenly father feeds them are you not much more valuable than they
1189407 made me think for many many many months that was life in romania a clear cut picture
1189408 i see things in beijing that maybe american born people cant see
1189409 people watching you going into the hotel room and seeing that people have been there that theyve moved something done something you never know
1189410 hopefully we wont experience some kind of sabotage but we have to be prepared thats why we will be living in the olympic village because its a very supervised place and the transportation is very well organized
1189411 you kind of have a little bit of fear so many people always around and you dont know what their duties are maybe their duty is to just watch you who knows
1189412 i consider myself very lucky that i could live my life through all the ups and downs
1189413 i still believe it was fortunate the way i did it
1189414 that was ridiculous absolutely ridiculous that confirmed all my doubts and worries
1189415 our daughter andrea was there so the obvious question was whats going to happen to her
1189416 we could go back and take the consequences i knew id be in big trouble or try to go on with our life with a very somber looking future
1189417 by the time we were able to get through the phone lines the secret police knew that we hadnt returned they cut the connection we couldnt get in touch with anybody
1189418 i kept telling martha were going to be out of here were going to get out of here were going to get out of here she was having the biggest loss of her life leaving andrea behind but she saw me working and fighting to make a living
1189419 we had moments nights when we said how do we make it through this but we were together
1189420 and im not a big crier but for that i was very emotional she traveled by herself she didnt speak any english but she wasnt crying she was a tough little girl
1189421 when we defected we were condemned as enemies of the communist system there were a lot of cases where people disappear
1189422 go up to them and say hello my name is
1189423 you either have your own hate agenda or you are truly seeking answers
1189424 and again i beg for questions about what proof you need
1189425 intended to provide mortgage relief for 400 000 struggling u s homeowners and to stabilize financial markets
1189426 fannie and freddie exist to provide guarantees for mortgage backed securities trading in the market the business is simply insurance

1189428 you do this too you were the eugenic leader and by the way you have lynching racial segregation
1189429 the muslim community of the globe today is in the neighborhood of one billion that is an impressive figure but what to me is equally impressive is that islam today is the fastest growing monotheistic religion this is something we have to take into account something is right about islam it is attracting a good many people

1189509 i am so sorry to cause you such concern but it is because ever since i have arrived there is no place that i can fart without being heard by the family and i am too embarassed to do so in front of all of you
1189510 my dear you had me so worried this is nothing just a little gas please go ahead and let it out none of us will think badly of you in fact since we have been talking i have farted many times without you even knowing it

1189520 for the past 10 years ive been concerned about the market and thought that something needed to be done
1189521 none of those conversations suggest that favre was soliciting a job or that other teams were soliciting his services
1189522 based on the information that we had the packers thought it was appropriate to bring this matter to the leagues attention
1189523 we respect the commissioners investigation of this matter and we now consider it closed
1189524 we provided the league with all information requested so they could be comprehensive in their decision making
1189525 our focus has been and continues to be on our football team and having a successful season
1189526 i know if they do open it up to competition not a lot of people give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be and let coach decide from there
1189527 if he is i might go see him when im done here
1189528 det f r inte se ut p det h r viset
1189529 only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california
1189530 i believe that marriages that have been entered into subsequent to the may 15 supreme court opinion will be recognized by the california supreme court
1189531 i would think the court in looking at the underlying equities would most probably conclude that upholding the marriages performed in that interval before the election would be a just result
1189532 who the heck is laura veirs then ive made my point
1189533 the global economy you know michael the things you study
1189534 it was no surprise that the jury reached this conclusion
1189535 the evidence in the case was very strong and the jury was very attentive
1189536 it was a very long trial and it was a very hard working jury
1189537 they just came to a different conclusion than what we had wanted
1189538 we have been pushing for a compromise between legislative leaders and we will continue to push for a budget deal that includes budget reform
1189539 we all along have said everything should be on the table
1189540 if i give you 200 000 could you create 2 new jobs
1189541 how would you each like at 8 500 pay raise
1189542 you know what we are having a hard time getting people to work for us in austin because the property taxes they have to pay are so high so we want a deal where samsung employees do not have to pay any personal property taxes and while you are at it we want it so that samsung employees dont have to pay any state sales tax either
1189543 this is what austin is giving us offer us a better deal
1189544 the right wing in america hates anyone who is not a wasp and want the rich to get richer and the poor to get poorer
1189545 no one can terrorize a whole nation unless we are all his her accomplices

1189549 following world war ii jewish people scattered all over the world
1189550 it is the mission of the lubavitch to reach out to them and bring them back into the faith
1189551 weve been putting up mezuzahs what you call a jewish security system
1189552 we go to homes and teach them about jewish heritage about the torah
1189553 theres been a lot of discussion a lot of shmoozing
1189554 hopefully were going to have a naming ceremony or two
1189555 there was a funeral unfortunately not long after i arrived on island
1189556 no one knew the prayers but i did since i attended religious school
1189557 probably the most important thing is realizing that the vast majority of kids are going to be fine no matter what they do and where they do it but in the summer you should get a good sports physical
1189558 getting children to start thinking mathematically and thinking scientifically through play everything is centered around play
1189559 just like we in the state stepped up for the everglades washington you see has failed to do so we can do our own lets just say do the best if we rely on ourselves rather than washington d c
1189560 our ecosystem and our environmental programs that we have in place they would be in jeopardy
1189561 how can you justify the millions of dollars of property damage caused by the animal liberation front alf
1189562 its fine for you to believe in animal rights but why do you try to tell other people what to do
1189563 this is a historic moment in the struggle for animal rights
1189564 it will doubtless be remembered as a key moment in the defence of our evolutionary comrades
1189565 we are seeking to break the species barrier we are just the point of the spear
1189566 chris works at a comic book shop so he reviews all the latest releases but the real awesomeness lies in his ability to find obscure or forgotten comic books and write hilariously sarcastic reviews that make fun of them they deserve it
1189567 there are so many new people in the area and there isnt a place for them to sit down and have breakfast
1189568 if you want breakfast or dinner you have to go over one of the bridges
1189569 i went to 50 different places and franchises looking for ideas we wanted a diner that isnt boring
1189570 you step into a different world when you come in here
1189571 we have been engaged in dialogue with interested investors on several occasions in the past
1189572 we are currently involved in dialogue with two particular investment groups that are both indicating serious interest in this project
1189573 accredits and certifies more than 15 000 health care organizations and programs in the united states
1189574 when we learned that they had a design division we asked them if we could work together if we could get it in writing that we would collaborate
1189575 the design team should include the joint commission since they are the accrediting body and our goal is to develop a joint commission accredited hospital
1189576 ata agrees with the port authoritys assessment that the dots proposed auction rules are unwise and unlawful we share the port authoritys concerns with the dots slot auction proposal and with its threat to add still more congestion to the region we are carefully reviewing the port authoritys proposed notice
1189577 instead of providing the infrastructure that we all need the dot is trying to hide its failure behind an economics experiment to ration air service sadly this illegal scheme will do nothing to reduce air traffic congestion or to meet the regions and the nations need for air transportation
1189578 i made a mistake im not going to deny it
1189579 although it is a misdemeanor theft is in fact a crime of moral turpitude
1189580 but theft is whether its a misdemeanor or a felony in my opinion
1189581 an act of baseness violence or depravity in the private and social duties which a person shows to a fellow man or to society in general contrary to the accepted and customary rule of right and duty
1189582 that was the original intention before surgery but after surgery he was moved to the regular floor
1189583 basically the implementation will be status quo for the first quarter of the year
1189584 although there is no second reading block there is a lot of work to be done for the program you know that
1189585 i feel that kindergarten and first grade should continue on with the second reading block because if we are trying to reach the goal of all third graders reading at grade level we need to catch them as much as possible
1189586 we are doing an injustice to the kids if they are coming in and we want them to get to benchmark and we dont teach it
1189587 from there you are going to make a selection based on three programs that are going through a request for proposals progress as to what you guys want to use in your school during 2009 to 2010 thats not going to come into play until toward the end of the year
1189588 nancy pelosi and harry reed are the independent oilmans politics and culture

1189590 sign on young man and sail with me the stature of our homeland is no more than the measure of ourselves our job is to keep her free our will is to keep the torch of freedom burning for all to this solemn purpose we call on the young the brave the strong and the free heed my call come to the sea come sail with me

1189593 a kind providence has placed in our breasts a hatred of the unjust and cruel in order that we may preserve ourselves from cruelty and injustice
1189594 ministers need to tell us what they are doing with this 100m a year taken from motorists
1189595 how much is actually put back into practical road safety that does not involve speed cameras ministers failure to answer that question confirms the view that for this government the british motorist is a nice little earner
1189596 the government needs to rethink ways of improving road safety including cracking down on uninsured drivers
1189597 safety cameras are there to save lives not make money
1189598 independent research has shown there are 1 745 fewer deaths and serious injuries at camera sites each year
1189599 the government is clear that the best safety camera is the one which takes no fines at all but succeeds in deterring drivers from speeding

1189605 responsible actions were taken with the proper authorities giving the all clear to return to normal operations
1189606 we will address any deficiencies in our terminal infrastructure to ensure our operations are not affected by the things of this nature in the future

1189610 portraying a victim of domestic violence has been the biggest challenge i have ever faced as an actress
1189611 just playing the role has taken a huge emotional toll on my life but it is nothing compared to the pain fear and torment experienced by the thousands of women refuge supports every day
1189612 i have no doubt this campaign will give strength to many women who may be experiencing abuse now or who may do so in the future to reach out and get help
1189613 its all too easy for women to excuse their partners possessive and jealous behaviour but in so doing they run the risk of the abuse increasing in frequency and severity over time
1189614 by understanding the signs early a woman is forewarned and forearmed

1189632 its a hard won opportunity for chinese businesses to expand their international market through their links to the games
1189633 for four games since 1992 chinese athletes wore li ning to the podium its painful to see adidas in the glory at our doorstep
1189634 we are not as powerful as adidas financially and that means we have to budget our marketing expenditures in a wiser and more economical manner
1189635 im waiting for their annual report to tell whether they are winners or losers in the olympic deal
1189636 the company needs to budget at least three to four times the initial spending in subsequent marketing activities
1189637 it all depends on yourself to maximize the economic returns an olympic logo next to your brand is certainly an advantage but that doesnt immunize anyone from the market competition

1189691 they mentioned a man who they said had carried out the varanasi blasts
1189692 if we had a beat constable system he would have noticed three strangers at the seminary and inquired

1189714 based on the information that we had the packers thought it was appropriate to bring this matter to the leagues attention

1189720 too many people in those states will opt to cut down on their consumption of those foods to save money there are far better ways to control harmful anal emissions such as tax breaks on charcoal tablets
1189721 i believe people in texas or vermont would actually be willing to pay to cut the cheese a little more

1189725 you hunch over just enough with that much weight on your back and i heard and felt a pop pop and a twinge down my leg i immediately started getting sharp pains into my leg
1189726 i felt like i was going to make the team
1189727 the most devastating time in my life up to that point
1189728 i realized that if you compared a child being diagnosed with autism to not making the olympic team all of a sudden that olympic thing doesnt seem so bad
1189729 this is truly an historic day in the fight against tobacco
1189730 regulating tobacco is the single most important thing that we can do right now to protect the public health of all americans especially our children
1189731 the tobacco industry has thrived on the business of addiction for decades by turning children into tobacco users with slick marketing tactics and misleading the public about the harms of its deadly products
1189732 the administration supports efforts to encourage adults who smoke to choose to quit and to prevent children from ever using tobacco products

1189738 no amount of additional u s forces can affect the outcome
1189739 john mccains essential focus has been on the tactical issue of sending more troops
1189740 hes made his entire approach to foreign policy rest on that support of bushs decision to send more troops in
1189741 senator obama doesnt understand he doesnt understand whats at stake here
1189742 he chose to take the political path that would have helped him get the nomination of his party
1189743 if we place 30 000 more troops in there then we would see an improvement in the security situation and a reduction in the violence
1189744 i think it is indisputable that weve seen violence reduced
1189745 and thats a credit to our brave men and women in uniform
1189746 for those of us whove been involved with politics in alaska one of the paradigms that we counted on in terms of funding public policy was the capability of ted stevens
1189747 its not as though we dont have the capability to take care of ourselves
1189748 if he leaves the appropriations committee how long do they leave the stryker brigade here

1189753 then you put misty the best defensive player in the world behind her misty is an absolute playmaker she gets to just about everything
1189754 over the course of an hour with kerri at the net and misty behind its a nightmare for these other teams
1189755 but theyre doing it to everybody theyre beating everybody theyre playing awesome volleyball
1189756 rachel and elaine had broken up so it made it a viable option
1189757 we had a heart to heart about it we said this is about us lets not let anyone get in our way if we decide to separate its going to be because of us
1189758 it wasnt like i hate you were not playing together there was never any of that it wasnt kerri and i saying we should split up it came from the outside but we put the blinders on and we moved past it
1189759 it was nothing against dane but we felt like we had kind of stopped growing
1189760 we thought maybe a new and fresh perspective would help
1189761 i dont know any other players who could hold up to the scrutiny and expectations that have been put on their shoulders
1189762 look at their two big streaks they won 89 straight matches and 15 tournaments in what was their most important year 2004 now theyre at 101 and 18 in what is now their most important year 2008
1189763 as kerri says when they lose people react like the world has come to an end
1189764 mistys very determined but youre not going to get a peep out of her im animated really loud i think thats what it takes she calms me down i pump her up
1189765 i know where shes going to be she knows where im going to be and in tight situations that experience can pull us through
1189766 i cant imagine we could make a better team playing with someone else
1189767 she made her choice and that was up to her
1189768 were here to represent our country we have a nice rivalry with russia with or without her its always been a battle whether shes here or not well always bring our best
1189769 its not an issue anymore were playing against russia now and its 12 people
1189770 anyone who puts that uniform on is our opposition there is no individual that we look at or highlight

1189772 we did a good job of putting 40 minutes together
1189773 we took a step closer to what we are trying to accomplish
1189774 we expect it to be a great game and look forward to it
1189775 they are the no 1 ranked team in the world they have tremendous players on there basketball is a game where anything can happen you want to meet the u s as late as possible
1189776 i have been playing against those players for 10 years i think when the ball goes up its just going to be another basketball game
1189777 there is one little kid there every day with his father

1189780 when i step on the line in beijing dont worry ill be ready to go
1189781 i felt like i would after a five set match when it was 3 all in the first set im not quite in playing shape right now
1189782 i actually walked the bike about three quarters of the way down then i jumped on the bike and hit a rock
1189783 the tire popped and i went over the handlebars and absolutely shredded my shoulder
1189784 couldnt hit a backhand until 14 days ago it was incredibly frustrating
1189785 i was a little rustier than i hoped i would be
1189786 well run out an offense every day that doesnt have many weaknesses
1189787 it sets up a fair test and whether 3 under par wins or 13 under par wins it doesnt care

1189790 op dit moment kost het enkele dagen en honderden gigabytes om een domein over te nemen als het alleen om computable nl gaat is dat een hoop werk maar als het om het hele nl of het com domein gaat is dat voor een crimineel zeker de moeite waard hoewel het op zou moeten vallen wanneer een crimineel probeert de juiste afzenderpoort te raden zijn er genoeg providers aan het slaapwandelen het is dus mogelijk dat een crimineel een gepatchte dns server bij een provider overneemt zonder dat die provider daar iets van merkt
1189791 het vermoeden bestaat dat botnets op dit moment aangepast worden om dit soort overnames uit te voeren via duizenden of honderdduizenden gehackte computers
1189792 over 95 percent of people living with hiv are not transmitting to someone else in a given year

1189795 i used to be somebody until i developed an addiction to drugs alcohol and younger women but i am happy to say i dont do drugs anymore and i am fairly certain that i will be somebody again do you want to join me on the ride
1189796 i was hooked on drugs alcohol and young women but i got off the drugs
1189797 there is also evidence that the ready availability of contraception results in some young people becoming sexually active who would not otherwise have done so

1189809 if senator obama isnt comfortable meeting wounded american troops without his entourage perhaps he does not have the experience necessary to serve as commander in chief
1189810 it is safe to say that according to press reports barack obama avoided skipped canceled the visit because of those reasons
1189811 made time to go to the gym but canceled a visit with wounded troops seems

1189835 the poorest filipino workers are receiving their salaries daily and almost all the time what they get is not enough for their families needs furthermore if the arroyo government is really sincere to provide access to affordable basic commodities why only put up a single venue to sell these every half of the month a worker in novaliches or pasig will not go to lawton manila just to buy discounted instant noodles which will cost him or her higher fare
1189836 we cannot help but suspect that the arroyo government aims to sell to us some products which are not usually consumed by the public we are also apprehensive that the products available in the project are near expiration date so they want to dispose of these immediately

1189843 its like whoa whats that about why would i want to be someone else because i really dont i just want to be me
1189844 i got compared to diana ross the other day which was a real compliment and someone also wrote that i was the female otis redding which made me feel good because hes a hero of mine
1189845 it is a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when million of people are losing their homes and their jobs and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
1189846 i smashed most of the sixes straight over the bowlers head it was a brilliant feeling

1189866 im pretty nervous about being arrested because ive never been to prison it will be bad but the worst thing about being arrested will be that i wont get to go to an event that i have been planning for a long time this is one of the most important issues of our generation and its vital that we are allowed to discuss it its tragic that the police seem to want to stop that
1189867 all the 50 million has bought is a promise in the future of water it has bought air space it will not put any water in the murray river at this time
1189868 they should not be willy nilly trying to buy water at this time there is no plan
1189869 when you speak to those who have been charged with buying the water they concede there was no plan they just bought the cheapest water they could which was buying air space in dams it did not actually buy water at this time
1189870 for the first time and after years of inaction the environment will have an entitlement as governments allocate water
1189871 the use of these weapons causes acute pain constituting a form of torture
1189872 in certain cases they can even cause death as has been shown by reliable studies and recent real life events
1189873 attributable to other factors and not the low energy electrical discharge of the taser

1189877 if all those forests were cleared and all of the carbon in the biomass in the
1189878 it just shows the tragic level of authoritarianism when the police are cracking down on a group of people who simply want to get together to discuss the most important issue facing the world
1189879 we looked at half of australias remaining forests and our estimate is they can store around 33 billion tonnes of co2 these are very big numbers
1189880 if all those forests were cleared and all of the carbon in the biomass in the soil released into the atmosphere that would be the equivalent of about 80 per cent of australias annual emissions every year for 100 years so we really have to protect our natural forests
1189881 its the big old trees that have a very high amount of carbon and also the coarse woody debris the dead standing trees and the dead logs on the ground that are there in the natural undisturbed forests
1189882 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than we imagined
1189883 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction
1189884 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date
1189885 the situation could well have been as bad as this say five years ago we just didnt know but now we have a much better indication of the state of the worlds primates and the news is not good
1189886 the work with lion tamarins shows that conserving forest fragments and reforesting to create corridors that connect them is not only vital for primates but offers the multiple benefits of maintaining healthy ecosystems and water supplies while reducing greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change
1189887 i think what weve got at the moment is drought and i think that we have to recognise that weve got drought
1189888 its just completely unacceptable for any government to throw their hands in the air and say this is all getting a bit hard i think that well call it climate change and well pull back on support
1189889 we used absolutely the minimum force necessary to ensure safe access and entry routes to and from the site
1189890 however the response from protesters including those who have locked on to the vehicles causing the obstruction has required us to increase our presence on the site
1189891 the police are claiming the vehicles were blocking the emergency exit and were abandoned both of which are lies
1189892 the prospect of going to prison is a daunting one but e ons proposed new coal fired power station poses such a threat to the climate that its something were willing to face
1189893 if anyone is found to have breached their bail conditions they will be arrested
1189894 why stop at a top rate of 455 pounds why not go further
1189895 there is perhaps a danger that the proposed changes are large enough to be noticed but not large enough to change behaviour
1189896 if climate change really is as important and urgent as the government frequently and rightly acknowledges then it would suggest there is a strong and defensible case for much more penal taxes on high emissions cars
1189897 a failure to advertise green tax details to the public breeds suspicion about their objectives increasing the perception of them as revenue raising measures with no environmental purpose
1189898 these reforms will take two billion pounds from motorists already struggling with high fuel costs and risk making transport less affordable for any but the rich
1189899 if there are changes in the amount of ice cover in the antarctic then it means there are going to be changes in the amount of habitat that the whales have available to them
1189900 and were not sure how adaptable they are to living in a different kind of habitat
1189901 at some point they wont be able to interbreed even if they wanted to
1189902 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than we imagined
1189903 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction
1189904 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date
1189905 among the african species the great apes such as gorillas and bonobos have always tended to grab the limelight and even though they are deeply threatened it is smaller primates such as the red colobus that could die out first
1189906 the work with lion tamarins shows that conserving forest fragments and reforesting to create corridors that connect them is not only vital for primates but offers the multiple benefits of maintaining healthy ecosystems and water supplies while reducing greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change
1189907 wind energy has become an industrial and commercial sector that is in the global vanguard it is one of spains few examples of technological and business leadership creates employment produces high added value and boasts one of the highest indices of investment in research development and innovation
1189908 thank you environmentalists for making the 2002 fire season all it could be
1189909 we would be cutting the trees we should be leaving
1189910 their best efforts to do right by the law and sound science have been subverted by actions taken by or not taken by johnson our administrator
1189911 a lot of them are certainly hurt by the impact on their professional reputations
1189912 speaks for itself and the administrator is proud of the work the staff completed at his direction
1189913 relatively ineffective at reducing greenhouse gas concentrations given the potentially damaging effect on jobs and the u s economy
1189914 we believe epas hardworking dedicated staff has earned more respect than you are giving
1189915 youve got to say right heres the line in the sand were going to stop it here because its madness to continue
1189916 it doesnt paint a very good picture of the future for carbon emissions but there is no other real choice coal is one of the few fuel sources which has a real capacity to expand
1189917 i dont think in my lifetime i will ever see more than 50 percent of the coal fired plants in china being fitted with ccs
1189918 i think you resign yourself to the fact that youll only be able to stabilize
1189919 i think its great that theyre allowed to fly it
1189920 there is a subculture within the white southern population of which the scv is the most visible voice that feels besieged by modern culture in general and they identify the old south and confederacy as a way of life and a period of time before the siege began to really hit the south
1189921 we have indian hispanic black and white members of our camps and if anyone espouses anything hateful or racewise youre gone from the scv
1189922 i consider myself a southern gentleman but i just feel bringing this up now it represents a painful and a hurtful time and i dont think its necessary to hurt people to make a point
1189923 i think this is very likely to come back to bite them in the behind
1189924 i dont think seeing some gigantic confederate flag convinces anyone that the civil war was not about slavery and that the antebellum south was really a wonderful place where everybody got along
1189925 a flag may be a simple piece of cloth but its much more powerful than that
1189926 and if you start turning people away youre talking about a substantial investment in the local economy thats going to disappear
1189927 the pace of the development of bioenergy markets and the resource requirements to feed them will disrupt the entire southern wood fiber market
1189928 it will be much steeper and more disruptive than that of the osb market over the last 15 years we recommend that forest products companies begin planning for the future by establishing stronger relationships with their suppliers and creating more efficient transportation lines
1189929 we were beginning to see the effects of new energy markets in the delivered prices for pulpwood chips and wood fuel in some areas in the south
1189930 we thought it was time to take a closer look using the breadth and depth of our data to determine what the competitive landscape for wood fiber might look like in 10 or 15 years
1189931 given that the northern spotted owl has been experiencing about a 4 percent annual rate of population decline for the last 15 years any reductions from current levels of habitat protection cannot be justified
1189932 this is the time period every year where we do see porpoises and dolphins washed up ashore it does happen
1189933 we want to take a look and see if thats possible in harbor porpoises is that occurring here

1189948 tippys death was the tragedy of my childhood you never red a book on psychology tippy you didnt need to you knew by some divine instinct that you can make more friends in two months by becoming genuinely interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get others interested in you
1189949 never had i seen such concentrated attention there was none of that piercing soul penetrating gaze business his eyes were mild and genial his voice was low and kind his gestures were few but the attention he gave me his appreciation of what i said was extraordinary youve no idea what it meant to be listened to like that
1189950 no thank you if god didnt make it i dont want it please

1189976 i got to work 1 on 1 this summer with coach helton hes a great quarterback coach and i really like his style of coaching
1189977 i got the chance yesterday to sit down with coach west and just talk about things
1189978 hes a great guy and you can just tell that hes going to help his players all he can he told me i can always come talk to him about anything i really like him a lot
1189979 they took me over and showed me where i would live and all of that i got to see all of the facilities and they just made me feel real comfortable with everything
1189980 they like to throw it a lot and thats good for me
1189981 to be honest the tshirt i am wearing in my facebook pic and the one to which you were referring i think is red rather than orange i dont know if the clothes i wear have much effect on my state of mind other than that stripes often cheer me up and wearing odd socks gives me a sneaky feeling of barely seen rebellion as a type 1 diabetic the number one of my five a day is to ensure i take my insulin injections at the right times of the day ive only been diagnosed for about a year now and am still struggling to come to terms with it all having to do four injections a day depresses the hell out of me but not doing them just makes things worse i had a crippling bout of depression last summer when i was really struggling to cope with my illness and for various complicated reasons too boring to recount here my family was apart from me for 5 out of every 7 days i dont want to go there again thats for sure so being a good diabetic means not being sad which is good being clean helps me feel happy i think lots of showers are good looking at my 6 year old when he is asleep helps put things into perspective it also helps me forget what a sod hes been during the day i like helping people going out of my way to do stuff for them and doing it quickly too i think it probably comes out of some deep rooted desire to be liked i dunno but its nice when folk say thanks taking a break from things always helps i can get wound up about stuff especially when it is things that i care about and that i devote my time to its not always as easy to progress things as it possibly ought to be but getting in a strop generally doesnt help on the other hand sometimes when you ignore a problem it will go away not often but sometimes
