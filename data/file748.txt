7480001 i am delighted that the admirable efforts of our officers have taken a substantial quantity of illegal drugs and a firearm off our streets
7480002 the arrests clearly demonstrate our zero tolerance to illegal substances and firearms we take these cases very seriously and will continue to pursue them vigorously
7480003 i ran it like there was no tomorrow and i live to fight another night
7480004 i am not really sure i just ran i just stayed in my lane and just kept on running 202 metres i got knocked out four years ago i am just so happy and i feel blessed
7480005 and she is going to fight all the way to the end
7480006 i know that i am here for a reason and i believe in myself i just have to go and run a bit harder than i did today
7480007 when you are at this stage you just have to forget about whatever your body is telling you and try to get your mind strong and that is what i did
7480008 i would have liked to have got a medal and i would have liked to at least come out with a personal best but ive had a rough season no one thought i would be in this final so i am happy
7480009 we were hoping for her to get a personal record but last night she told me she was having a hip problem
7480010 but she was going to put that out of her mind and just go into the race and compete and that is what she did
7480011 maybe in 2012 i will be there in my heels i am not sure
7480012 the continued strengthening of the cultural identity of the caymanian people has received a major shot in the arm with the completion of the museum restoration works
7480013 the building adds a modern facility to the islands cultural amenities while at the same time preserving the foremost example of caymanian architecture that the buildings represent
7480014 i am just absolutely delighted that the project has come through in a timely way and that it has been completed within the adjusted budget
7480015 a key way of achieving that was through seconding the ministrys facilities manager tommy ebanks who had oversight of inputs and services towards completion of this project
7480016 the level of support and what we have been able to achieve is a demonstration of what a museum has to be a cultural beacon that serves to ground people and to bring them together things caymanian should be respected and conserved and those who have made this landmark achievement possible show their understanding and commitment to that goal
7480017 the outcome did not come without challenges and we had our private moments of doubts but we are all immensely proud of the outcome it is now a beautiful solid building balancing that critical tension between preservation of an icon and the modernization needed to serve contemporary cayman
7480018 we are moving full steam ahead on all the necessary planning to restart and re engineer a national museum
7480019 it was a pleasure to work with such a cohesive group
7480020 and to have been involved with restoring the building 26 years later it gave me such great pride
7480021 tommy shared the vision of all the players and then matched that vision with what could be achieved on the island
7480022 it is an amazing feeling to see before me today a 200 year old authentic two storey structure completely and accurately restored and ready to embrace another century to have witnessed its transition from a state of disrepair to one of pure regal beauty is truly incredible to say the least
7480023 rich in character utilizing go green efforts and filled with the latest technology to better serve our audience

7480028 a brand new famous five mystery and adventure survival handbook in one
7480029 anything that promotes the original books can only be a good thing
7480030 i have already read one of the books that will be released next year the secret valley and i can say that it is very much in enid blytons original style in fact i defy anyone to know that it is not actually enid blyton writing
7480031 blytons stories have been enjoyed by millions over the years and there is a huge demand for more of her magical storytelling blyton was passionate in her advocacy of child literacy and as the guardians of her estate we see it as our duty to continue that legacy

7480033 it is as if a new and fresh breeze has blown through the afrikaans advertising landscape this years pendoring entries are some of the best that have yet been received in the 14 years of this competitions existence
7480034 i believe that the standard of the finalists work will silence those sceptics who feel that afrikaans advertising and pendoring are struggling to survive
7480035 although radio and television are popular specifically the newspaper magazine poster and design categories excelled this year naturally in the category genuine south african the judges had a difficult time to determine a winner because of the high standard i often say that international advertising professionals can learn from afrikaans and south african advertising creatives
7480036 this is the third time in five years that i have been a pendoring judge and i can therefore confidently say that this years work have topped that of previous years
7480037 the viral and online work is simply not up to the standard that it should be in a fast developing technological world the students have once again bowled over experienced advertising professionals
7480038 a technological tsunami is currently flowing through the industry those that ignore the development explosion will start to suffer to get their message across to their target audience
7480039 a cause for concern is the absence of work from the large south african companies especially the motor manufacturers i am at a loss to understand why people spend less on afrikaans advertising because research has time and again indicated that a third of the purchasing power lies in the hands of afrikaans speakers
7480040 we were responsible for four hospitality marquees the pit and paddock infrastructure the infrastructure to meet the requirements set by the international organisers fim for their offices and the media and press centre
7480041 our electrical business unit oasys electrical supplied the power supply to all these various marquees and the pit boxes
7480042 we provided a glass cassette marquee with flooring air conditioning electrical outlets and furniture providing the riders and their guests with the very best position and surroundings to enhance their enjoyment of the race this also included a stand alone marquee for the kitchen and storage space to accommodate the imported food and supplies this facility was geared towards the international chefs who accompany the top riders who carefully avoid eating any exotic or potentially tainted food before an important event oasys events also supplied the various flagpoles located around the track
7480043 this facility accommodated both local and international media and operated for 18 hours of the day we included access to telephone lines provided by telkom and internet connectivity sponsored by vodacom the fim media officers had their own separate marquee which they utilised as their press office in addition to the comprehensive media centre we supplied 100 televisions and lcd screens were supplied for both the media centre and hospitality marquees these provided all 20 000 spectators with access to all the action on the circuit
7480044 we always go the extra mile to ensure that our customers are absolutely satisfied customer satisfaction has always been number one with us
7480045 i am delighted see patricia join the banks senior management team she is an example of a young caymanian professional realising her goals not only through hard work and perseverance but also by ensuring she has the relevant qualifications in her field
7480046 in addition to patricias extensive career experience she has shown herself to be a dedicated hsbc employee who continually seeks to improve her skills this promotion is well deserved
7480047 we really are amazed at how well received we have been since we opened the studio
7480048 we did a lot of marketing and even before we actually opened for business we had people dropping by and leaving notes asking to book in for a course of treatment even before we were ready for business
7480049 the system uses high and low pressure to increase the blood flow through the fat on specific areas of the body which results in burning 80 percent more fat during a workout that you would normally experience
7480050 we are treating clients in every age group and with every body type from teens to people in their seventies
7480051 this is not just a miracle system we offer our clients a full personal assessment where we discuss exercise and nutritional advice we offer a full food programme and a personal training service as well in an effort to create an all round service we want to encourage people to live a healthier lifestyle eat well and drink much more water with hypoxi our clients can exercise at a comfortable level and providing they are eating the right foods they will see a dramatic change fairly quickly
7480052 the vacunaut targets the fat around your tummy thighs and buttocks and breaks it down while you exercise at a moderate level
7480053 owing to the technology of the system you are always exercising in the fat burning zone
7480054 many people will know what it feels like to work out regularly to eat well but still find that they cant move the stubborn fat
7480055 this really works and makes an incredible difference hypoxi is truly wonderful
7480056 a healthy workforce is a productive workforce and hypoxi treatment covers a myriad of ailments but above all it gets rid of unhealthy body fat which will make even the healthiest people feel better
7480057 we are extremely pleased to take on us distributorship of tortuga rums
7480058 rum is a growth category and we foresee substantial opportunity to grow tortuga building on the success the tortuga brand has achieved in the caribbean islands
7480059 the consumer awareness resulting from the tortuga rum cake business in the us will assist in our development of the tortuga rum brand which in its own right is well known to the more than two million annual visitors to the cayman islands
7480060 this new relationship is an excellent springboard for the tortuga rum brand
7480061 gemini spirits amp wine has a long tradition of building successful brands in the american market we believe that tortuga is an excellent fit into their brand portfolio and look forward to being their next success story

7480196 until recently they had been largely only targeting commercial centres and police stations in fermanagh with large devices but have switched tactics to attempt to murder police officers
7480197 however we are well aware of who is behind this and there is a hardcore of around a dozen members
7480198 we are totally consumed about our clash with wexford who have shown themselves to be a very resilient side obviously the kerry v cork replay adds another dimension to the closing stages of the championship but our focus will be on getting past wexford if we can
7480199 we have developed what we believe to be a unique range with significant export potential
7480200 our business growth strategy is focused on building sales in key european markets such as the netherlands and britain by offering innovative and quality products
7480201 we have a strong base in northern ireland and the republic of ireland and while both markets offer opportunities for further growth our market research indicates there is significant scope to build sales faster in other neighbouring european markets
7480202 invest nis technical support for the development and production of the new shower trays has been immensely important they are much more flexible and aesthetically pleasing than traditional trays due to the reduced side wall profile and smooth base whilst also suitable for installation directly onto joists due to the solid cast structure of the tray
7480203 the tory party is going nowhere fast and is rapidly becoming an irrelevance in british politics i believe the tory party has done little or nothing for northern ireland apart from selling us out at sunningdale and foisting the anglo irish agreement upon us
7480204 the cause of the union in northern ireland is best served by winning friends for the union in all the parties at westminster not aligning our fortunes to any one party
7480205 id suggest you go and take refuge in an orange hall somewhere and console yourself that you have faith and there wont be any catholics in your midst because thats your choice and as a conservative im all for choice although its not a choice id take if on the other hand you want to move beyond the tribal swamp that masquerades as ulster protestant culture wed be happy to welcome you as an active member of the conservative party

7480247 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7480248 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7480249 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7480250 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7480251 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7480252 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7480253 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
7480254 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
7480255 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
7480256 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica

7480263 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras

7480271 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
7480272 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
7480273 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

7480281 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas

7480311 i had a bad few days but i sat down and thought about it after i lost and i realised i was never going to be a winner over here anyway because theres no way i was going to beat shiming zou
7480312 after the fight i said a few things heat of the moment stuff some people back home probably do understand but the papers just jumped at the chance to ridicule me but i just need to grow up
7480313 but at the end of the day its still a bronze as soon as i got out of the ring there were a load of microphones stuck in my face
7480314 but hopefully people will remember me more as an olympic bronze medallist than for what i said

7480325 hopefully its not as bad this time but theyre not going to give any medals out in august or september everybody wishes are that you win every game and it doesnt happen and everybody wishes that you dont get injuries but it happens
7480326 we have got difficult away games and its never easy at fratton park then we have got liverpool and chelsea with the super cup in between it does not give us any respite

7480396 you make the furrow straight by picking a point at the other end of the field and keeping your eye on it then you drive the tractor to that point not taking your eye off of it and when you get there and look back you will have a straight furrow

7480414 we werent at our best but its all about winning and we know we will have to work hard to win games
7480415 everyone has to be committed we took a long time to get into the game and our passing wasnt good enough in the first half tranmere will feel they should have taken something from the game and they probably have a point
7480416 we can take plenty of positives from the game but we have to learn about defending from set plays we gave away too many free kicks and leicester have decent players who can hurt you at set plays
7480417 i probably picked the wrong team so i am to blame and i accept responsibility we had no shape or balance
7480418 weve been mugged the performance wasnt bad but we couldnt get past a goalkeeper who was in inspired form
7480419 e were second best and i asked the players why i thought it was individuals second best and as a group we were second best and in the end we got what we deserved
7480420 we fell miles short of our standards hopefully the players will come back more determined its back to back defeats but everybody will have back to back defeats in this league thats the way this league is its disappointing so to play so poorly
7480421 jag har inget att d lja s f r mig r vervakning inte ett problem
7480422 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
7480423 it has been a pretty tough pre season but its starting to pay off
7480424 the guys are getting through a lot of hard work
7480425 our concentrations levels are much better now because we are not as tired as we were last year theres definitely been a benefit from all the hard work we have been doing
7480426 heyneke has set some goals and the team has really risen to that
7480427 i have been quite surprised how quickly it has come together actually
7480428 there has been a really positive attitude this year it wasnt embarrassing last year but we know we were below par
7480429 its always easier having the more experienced players and the international players back
7480430 there were still a lot of errors but i am happy with where we are
7480431 its important that we keep our feet on the ground because there is still a long way to go
7480432 we will do whatever is possible to bring the car to the u s that i promise
7480433 we need the support of the vw audi group and we need to overcome some legal hurdles regarding licensing but at the end of the day we want to see this vehicle on the streets of america
7480434 unfortunately we suffered with a reliability problem which lost us precious points now we have to find out what happened in yet another engine failure and then decide how to react
7480435 clearly what happened is serious and we will have to do all in our power to make up for the ground we have lost through reliability problems in the coming races
7480436 now we must continue to push to the maximum to develop the car and improve reliability in order to be as well prepared as possible for the forthcoming races
7480437 i dont know about their being the worst but i normally stay away from the french when i travel
7480438 my brother whos a parisian travel agent says avoid the french when traveling because they tend to be negative their inability to maintain open minds make it difficult for them to adapt or accept other cultures they tend to complain and compare everything to france and close their eyes they can take the pleasure away from your travels
7480439 i dont know if the french are the least desirable tourists i do know they tend to complain about the minute details rather than calling attention to something that may not be to their liking as a result the staff may be more accommodating but there is no good or bad tourist we only have guests who expect value for the money theyre spending as professionals we hope guests will respect our staff and our local culture and the french dont tend to be the best when it comes to that whether theyre in france or traveling elsewhere
7480440 i live in a tourist town and the french who come here seem polite in town and excited on the ski slopes i dont hear complaints about the french the stereotypes i do hear russians are rude and entitled and too rich for their own good germans are too loud in voice and dress australians are friendly but dont tip and texans are all of the above
7480441 were all hosts in our own countries if hospitality is welcoming and thoughtful the recipient of that hospitality is going to be grateful and personable whether hes french or american thats a universal truth tourists are travelers hungry for food shelter and recognition theyre in a foreign land its not too much to ask hosts to behave graciously particularly if theyre in the hospitality industry if theyre not in that industry then good manners and human kindness should fill the gaps everything else is just trimmings

7480446 les agriculteurs sont tr s d termin s ils ne peuvent accepter que des industriels fixent les prix sans discussion et ne veulent pas devenir leur variable dajustement

7480448 or tv surplus is a powerful force to be reckoned with
7480449 the amount of concern and urgency from the detroit companies has increased in the last month and significantly ratcheted up what theyre communicating what their funding needs are
7480450 i believe we should fund it and take action that will assist detroit and its suppliers in making it through this difficult time of transition
7480451 its a common sense response to the realities on the ground
7480452 we dont see it as a bailout we see it as government assistance to help retooling tied to the production of these advanced technology vehicles
7480453 government policy can be aligned with consumer demand and the efforts of the industry
7480454 congress created a program for direct loans and were hopeful that they can fund those this year
7480455 you can take the hardest rock band on the earth and they sound like a bunch of girls next to the dubliners
7480456 auch wenn die vp noch hundert mal versucht den eurofighter vergleich schlechtzureden minister darabos ist es gelungen 370 millionen euro f r sterreich einzusparen
7480457 darabos hat es geschafft aus dem irrsinns deal von 2003 das beste f r sterreich herauszuholen es steht jetzt viel geld zur verf gung dass f r bildung soziales und gesundheit verwendet werden kann
7480458 das milit rische einsch tzungsverm gen von herrn amon l sst sich in frage stellen er ist ja nicht einmal mitglied im landesverteidigungsausschuss
7480459 und es w re ihm bewusst dass es keine andere nation gibt die etwas anderes als eurofighter der tranche 1 fliegt
7480460 f r die berwachung des sterreichischen luftraums sind die tranche 1 flugzeuge ausreichend qualififziert f r die nato tr umerereien der vp br uchten die eurofighter nat rlich die gesamte kampfausstattung aber daf r ist die sp nicht zu haben
7480461 zum jetzigen zeitpunkt w ren nur tranche 1 flugzeuge in sterreich
7480462 also warum hat sich die vp f r die eurofighter entschieden wenn sie meint es w ren schrottflugzeuge herr amon m ge bitte auskunft geben
7480463 wir werden das vorgehen der vp im bezirk jedenfalls sehr genau unter die lupe nehmen damit dieses wichtige thema nicht ab dem 28 september wieder in den schwarzen schubladen verschwindet
7480464 mit gro er motivation startet die sp ober sterreich in die wahlbewegung f r die bevorstehenden nationalratswahlen
7480465 die sp ober sterreich verpflichtet sich auch zu einem fairen wahlkampf
7480466 dieses traditionelle treffen der sp o wird die positive stimmung widerspiegeln
7480467 werner faymann steht f r die ziele die wir in ober sterreich seit jahren konsequent verfolgen wir wollen keine zwei klassen medizin wir wollen eine gesicherte pflegevorsorge und eine unbefristete verl ngerung der sogenannten hacklerreglegung genauso muss der unaufh rliche preisanstieg bei lebensmitteln energie und treibstoffen endlich gebremst werden
7480468 wir setzen in ober sterreich im gegensatz zu anderen parteien auf frauenpower
7480469 das zeigt ein blick auf unsere landesliste die mit barbara prammer maria berger und sonja ablinger von einem frauentrio angef hrt wird
7480470 die bisherige erfahrung zeigt n mlich dass die sp wenn es darauf angekommen ist immer zu ungunsten der sterreicher und zu gunsten der vp umgefallen ist warum sollte sich das ge ndert haben
7480471 wir sind bereit an einer umfassenden entlastungsoffensive f r die sterreicher mitzuarbeiten es ist allerdings zu bef rchten dass das chaos nach der nationalratswahl bis zu einer regierungsbildung ein arbeiten und umsetzen von ma nahmen schwierig machen wird
7480472 wir glauben nicht daran dass der nicht angriffspakt zwischen sp und vp den die sp nur geschlossen hat um nach der wahl bei der vp wieder als 1 adresse f r eine koalition anklopfen zu k nnen von der sp aufgeweicht wird das beispiel der studiengeb hren beweist dies ja nun anschaulich
7480473 und das wird dann die endg ltige nagelprobe f r die glaubw rdigkeit der sp sein das interesse der fp liegt darin den leidensdruck von den sterreichern zu nehmen das betrifft nicht nur die teuerungen sondern auch andere schicksalsfragen der zukunft und dazu geh rt auch die fatale weichenstellung der anderen parteien zum eu beitritt der t rkei und dessen unabwendbare folgen
7480474 diese auszeichnung mit den hoftafeln soll die teilnehmenden betriebe einerseits zu berdurchschnittlichen leistungen motivieren und andererseits besondere bem hungen belohnen die tafeln sollen auch ein ansporn f r laufende und weitere verbesserungen sein und nicht zuletzt die hohen leistungen der landwirtschaft f r die gesellschaft kommunizieren jeder landwirt darf stolz auf dieses zeichen seines besonderen erfolges sein diese tafel weist ihn definitiv als top betrieb seiner branche aus
7480475 mit unserer neu gestalteten anzeigenhomepage wollen wir unseren kunden noch mehr facts und infos zu den breit gef cherten werbem glichkeiten der krone bieten und dabei zugleich die nutzung der site vereinfachen
7480476 warum darf in nieder sterreich nicht jeder schulanf nger und taferlklassler gleich viel wert sein warum kann nicht jede familie wo f r einen buben oder m dchen der ernst des lebens beginnt in den genuss der n schulstarthilfe kommen nichts anderes ist schuld als der anhaltende widerstand der vp nieder sterreich die schulstarthilfe f r alle taferlklassler zu erm glichen f r viele familien stellt der schulbeginn auch eine gro e finanzielle belastung dar auch f r familien mit kleinem einkommen oder alleinerzieherinnen mit einem kind k nnen die kosten sehr belastend sein aber die will die vpn ja nicht unterst tzen
7480477 die n sozialdemokraten treten weiterhin f r eine ausweitung der n schulstarthilfe f r alle taferlklassler ein auch f r familien mit nur einem schulpflichtigen kind dies wird sich auch in einer initiative in der kommenden landtagssitzung niederschlagen f r uns sozialdemokraten sind jedes kind und jede familie gleich viel wert auch die alleinerzieherin mit einem kind verdient sich unsere unterst tzung
7480478 we were inconsistent its different when we dont have rj in the squad good thing gutilban stepped up for him
7480479 i have to check the mindset of our team its not a good character for a team that is aspiring something big
7480480 but i like our chances now still our target is the final four were not yet thinking about the twice to beat bonus
7480481 we made some adjustments especially with carl melegrito giving up his offense so he could focus on dysam
7480482 last april we witnessed the signing of the agreements for this project after only four months now we see it take off we welcome kuwaits trust in our economy
7480483 me parece asquerosa indecente y posiblemente ilegal desde muchos puntos de vista
7480484 dia seorang pengatur serangan yang hebat tahu kapan bola akan dilepas atau dengan model apa bola itu akan diarahkan ke depan kami tinggal menunggu dan merasakan sentuhan magisnya apalagi bola itu seperti selalu lengket di kakinya
7480485 lambat memang menjadi kekurangannya namun janga salah ia juga memiliki reaksi cepat terutama di awal sampai menjelang 2 3 pertandingan di saat itulah seorang roman bakal berbahaya dan lawan lawannya kemarin tentu sudah merasakan sengatan kakinya
7480486 karakter yang tumbuh ucapitulah yang justru membuatnya bisa beradaptasi di tim manapun ia bisa bermain lambat dan juga bisa bermain cepat jika daam top form nya sulit bagi siapapun untuk menghadangnya
7480487 aku tak perlu malu aku juga terus belajar setiap kali aku menyelesaikan sebuah pertandingan
7480488 aku benar benar belum merasa lengkap sebagia pemain sepakbola aku ingin sekali mengakhiri karirku saat aku mampu memeluk dan mengangkat tinggi piala itu
7480489 umurku sudah 30 tahun tahun depan 31 jika aku harus menunggu lagi empat tahun kemudian kemungkinan untuk bisa tampil di timnas argentina tidaklah sebesar sekarang dan mungkin saat itu permainanku sudah tak seperti sekarang makin lambat
7480490 aku rela mati untuk saudaraku mereka penculik red hanya memanfaatkan para pesepakbola yang bermain di eropa yang mereka anggap memiliki penghasilan luar biasa mereka harus dilawan
7480491 dia hebat tapi terlalu lambat untuk seorang playmaker yang bertugas sebagai penyerang lubang dia hanya cocok untuk permainan konvensional seperti tim tim italia
7480492 dia pemain hebat lambat karena skema permainan teman temannya seperti itu
7480493 momen kemarin benar benar luar biasa aku tak akan melupakan itu bagiku mengalahkan brasil sebuah perjuangan berat segala kemampuanku jelas hanya untuk mengalahkan brasil aku bisa dan jika aku menggapai emas itu adalah bonus yang lebih penting lagi kami bisa mengalahkan brasil
7480494 satu gol ke gawang brasil di event resmi tentu sangat berharga buatku dan aku tidak akan menyia nyiakan kesempatan jika itu memang ada
7480495 aku sangat sayang padanya aku tak ingin dia tampil sia sia aku ingin selalu berada di belakangnya dan menerima apa adanya dia
7480496 dia sangat perhatian cantik seksi menggairahkan dan sangat memberiku inspirasi dan semangat sepertinya aku tak salah jalan bareng dengannya
7480497 its 3am who do you want to answer the phone call
7480498 the thing that makes them want to rule america is the thing that stops them from thinking of prudent limits
7480499 es lebe der tag an dem wir uns wieder sehen
7480500 he is actually a boy but he lokks like a girl and he is a bishounen
7480501 the word twat was used in context it was meant to be a nasty word on purpose because this is a nasty character
7480502 however jacqueline doesnt want to offend her readers or her readers parents so when the book comes to be reprinted the word will be replaced with twit
7480503 everyone was polite and seemed interested but no one offered to raise money to build her
7480504 with a brilliant smile and the early facial creases of happy dissipation he was known for being cranky curious passive aggressive and most of all persnickety
7480505 but we will see more entrants with quite a few people from outside agriculture getting into the industry because of the world food shortage and the move to biofuels
7480506 the more significant investors will be private companies and im sure there are also super funds out there
7480507 to clarissa stone from herman jejune please see me in the lab at 4 00 thursday
7480508 the grants are not just about publicity the company was set up by its founder to be socially responsible not simply to generate profit but also to give back to the community this is not just charity which is easy it is to give money and allow it to do good in the grassroots so that the social enterprises become ecologically self sustainable and the people gain self respect
7480509 currently our profit sharing is 70 30 in favor of the community but we are studying if this is sustainable
7480510 aku benar benar senang dan aku ingin merayakan semuanya dengan teman teman termasuk siap untuk berpose dengan medali ini di tubuhku
7480511 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7480512 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7480513 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7480514 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7480515 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7480516 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7480517 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7480518 mom what are some of the things i am going to have to do to get girls
7480519 brown eyes what can i say about brown eyes there arent too many nice things that are brown
7480520 or water in an underground river because it would be dark
7480521 but there would be no light if it was underground
7480522 yeah there would if there was a crack in the rock above it
7480523 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7480524 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7480525 they will all tell you its fear and money and they will all be lying
7480526 so what is a mastermind and how can it benefit me
7480527 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7480528 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7480529 mmio range allocation failed rivatuner has been started in reduced low level functionality mode
7480530 the inclusion of forests in carbon markets enables developed countries to avoid real carbon emission reductions at home
7480531 a ploy by developed countries to shy away from their commitments to reduced carbon emissions
7480532 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7480533 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7480534 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7480535 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7480536 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7480537 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7480538 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7480539 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7480540 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7480541 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7480542 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7480543 ein kostenloses angebot des ffentlichen verkehrs w rde weitere milliarden kosten wir k nnen nicht soviel geld verschenken au erdem hat mobilit t ihren wert
7480544 das sind 275 euro pro steuerzahler gleichg ltig ob diese je ein ffentliches verkehrsmittel ben tzen oder nicht
7480545 offenbar geht und ging es der sp lediglich darum den eindruck zu erwecken als h tte sie zumindest eines ihrer wahlversprechen von 2006 gehalten immerhin
7480546 war darabos ja vor der wahl wahlkampfleiter und musste daher in der folge als f r die landesverteidigung zust ndiger minister wenigstens selbst den eindruck von einsparungen erwecken
7480547 nun entsteht der eindruck als h tte darabos dem bundesheer sogar wissentlich schaden zugef gt
7480548 aber das ist nicht das ende der fahnenstange die lteren ger te die darabos nun ausgedealt hat sind technisch schlechter ausgestattet bergen daher ein erh htes sicherheitsrisiko und haben viel h here folgekosten durch ersatzteile instandhaltung etc
7480549 auch ein weiteres ersuchen des nationalrates an den rechnungshof f r eine vertiefende berpr fung w re denkbar und f r eine abschlie ende gesamtbewertung von vorteil
7480550 ich verstehe dass es den wunsch daf r gibt ob ein solcher antrag zwei wochen vor der nationalratswahl allerdings viel sinn macht wo doch die gesamte bundesregierung zwei tage nach der wahl demissioniert ist eine andere frage bundespr sident fischer der ja die dann alte bundesregierung mit der zwischenzeitlichen f hrung der amtsgesch fte beauftragt sollte sich hingegen gut berlegen ob er darabos tats chlich mit der fortf hrung der gesch fte betraut immerhin ist der bundespr sident der oberbefehlshaber des bundesheeres
7480551 dass die w hlerinnern und w hler der sp am wahltag ohnehin die entsprechende antwort auf das dilettantische vorgehen von minister darabos geben werden
7480552 es w re jedenfalls h chst an der zeit dass darabos seine genauen vertragsunterlagen nicht nur dem orf sondern allen zust ndigen gremien des parlaments vorlegt
7480553 es ist richtig und wichtig unseren luftraum effizient berwachen zu k nnen das schafft sicherheit aber auch wirtschaftlichen nutzen und arbeitspl tze allerdings nur wenn man nicht so dilettantisch vorgeht wie noch minister darabos

7480573 why dont you come to work with us we will all work together
7480574 they tried to cheat us by telling us that we hadnt worked hard enough that we only deserved rs
7480575 we are working and when the movement calls us we go there too stopping work
7480576 if the factory closes then we want land if it goes on we want work there but we will never get work there because we do not have the education the skills or the experience needed
7480577 dont know there must be a channel of work somehow
7480578 first let the government ask us what we want then we can think
7480579 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7480580 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7480581 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7480582 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7480583 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7480584 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7480585 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7480586 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7480587 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7480588 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7480589 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7480590 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7480591 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7480592 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7480593 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7480594 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7480595 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7480596 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7480597 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7480598 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7480599 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7480600 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7480601 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7480602 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7480603 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7480604 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7480605 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7480606 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7480607 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7480608 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7480609 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7480610 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7480611 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7480612 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7480613 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7480614 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7480615 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7480616 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7480617 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7480618 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7480619 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

7480632 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7480633 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7480634 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7480635 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7480636 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7480637 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7480638 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7480639 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7480640 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7480641 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

7480809 we saw an increase in their confidence in the direction of the overall economy but that was offset by more owners saying theyre having cash flow issues
7480810 their perceptions of the conditions for their own businesses were flat making this gain harder to pin down there is still a great amount of caution out there
7480811 its not that surprising that small business owners are less apt to get involved in the political process
7480812 they are so fiercely independent and hard working that for one they dont have a lot of leftover time or money to donate and two they dont have the lobbying power in congress that larger corporations do

7480816 too ready criminalisation of children and young people for minor offences
7480817 the increased use of pre court summary justice is one of the most important elements in the governments strategy for modernising the criminal justice system
7480818 the implementation of the strategy has received virtually no research inspectoral or parliamentary scrutiny
7480819 not only are serious offenders escaping real justice due to the reliance on spot fines but as this report shows many people who should be dealt with informally are being criminalised he said
7480820 the public are sick and tired of this government pursuing easy targets instead of going after the real criminals this report also shows how labour went into headfirst into this reform without carrying out proper research
7480821 the best way to avoid a criminal record is not to break the law the law abiding majority want to see crimes dealt with effectively and fixed penalty notices and cautions are part of this process

7480839 the long duration flights possible with the global hawk platform present unique challenges for science instrumentation sigma had the opportunity to apply all its expertise in aerospace instrument engineering in this project we are grateful to be able to contribute to this unique tool for atmospheric research

7480856 vivevano e erano attivi a londra i florio padre e figlio due esiliati autentici due coltissimi e aristocratici umanisti italiani protestanti di origine ebrea la cui passione per la parola per le sacre scritture per le lettere e il sapere e la cui inventivit linguistica erano grandissime e appaiono a uno sguardo non accecato da pregiudizi e da blocchi culturali e ideologici essere esattamente le stesse passioni e inventivit che lautore di hamlet mostra di possedere

7480865 it is increasingly clear that president bush does not have a strategy for victory in iraq rather he hopes to prevent defeat and pass the problem along to his successor
7480866 the idea as in bosnia is to maintain a united iraq by decentralizing it giving each ethno religious group kurd sunni arab and shiite arab room to run its own affairs while leaving the central government in charge of common interests
7480867 fourth the president must direct the military to design a plan for withdrawing and redeploying our troops from iraq by 2008
7480868 this choice of biden is disappointing because he is the creator of the idea of dividing iraq
7480869 we rejected his proposal when he announced it and we still reject it dividing the communities and land in such a way would only lead to new fighting between people over resources and borders iraq cannot survive unless it is unified and dividing it would keep the problems alive for a long time
7480870 such a person if he would assume the vice presidency post would not serve to improve iraq usa relations

7480874 in most capital cities petrol prices crept higher in the latest week after falling sharply over the past month mr james said
7480875 based on trends in the wholesale market the average pump price looks set to consolidate near 1 50 a litre
7480876 the average motorist is now forking out around 209 a month on petrol a saving of around 20 from the highs in mid july but still up 40 a month on a year ago mr james said
7480877 fuelwatch wont work wont give the benefits to consumers that its meant to senator xenophon told abc radio today
7480878 if the wholesale price is determined by the big oil companies and they also control many of the outlets its not a level playing field for those small operators those independent operators in the retail sector
7480879 central to our concerns is the fact that the proposal forces retail prices to be locked in for a 24 hour period association spokesman matthew hanton said
7480880 by banning the intra day price movements of fuel retailers motorists will ultimately pay more at the pump particularly those thousands of motorists that already shop smart and take advantage of the weekly discount cycle

7480901 we respect appreciate and love our turkish cypriot compatriots and we wish to live with them peacefully under a free united and independent democratic country

7480905 i dont think its right that the pictures of the driver and the license plate are shipped off to a contractor who decides whether this stands out as a violation
7480906 the benefit of being pulled over by a trooper if there is any benefit is that there is a law enforcement person who is saying that you sped
7480907 i will tell you that the court has no discretion in setting the amounts of fines and i am required by law to impose them in full

7480910 it seemed to us that since we had finally brought down soviet communism and seen the birth of democracy in russia the most important thing to do was to help russian democracy take root and integrate russia into europe wasnt that why we fought the cold war to give young russians the same chance at freedom and integration with the west as young czechs georgians and poles wasnt consolidating a democratic russia more important than bringing the czech navy into nato

7481057 in his vancouver youth max maynard was close to emily carr and jack shadbolt two excellent artists but how good was his own painting
7481058 the question arises because bitterness over his failed art career dominated his life and the life of his family his wife fredelle and his daughters rona and joyce

7481174 prima di te bella la mia vita era una notte senza luna molto buia ma con qualche stella punti di luce e razionalit poi hai attraversato il cielo come una meteora allimprovviso tutto ha preso fuoco cera luce cera bellezza quando sei sparita la meteora scomparsa dietro lorizzonte e il buio tornato non era cambiato nulla ma i miei occhi erano rimasti accecati non vedevo pi le stelle niente aveva pi senso
7481175 ah e dite al signor hale che sua figlia lo ringrazia tanto per il suo regalo
7481176 salve signor hale questa la ricevuta dellabito da sposa di sua figlia una ragazza di bellezza sublime e mi ha detto di portarle i suoi ringraziamenti per il suo regalo
7481177 hes got some major problems like internal bleeding and hes on dialysis so his kidneys are failing again and they are talking again about suspected pneumonia so they are three bad reports
7481178 everything is down and its not looking good but weve still got hope
7481179 it takes about 10 hours for us to get a result
7481180 its been something of a concern this new problem hes got and we hope this will overcome it for them to at least put the operation off for some time
7481181 hes in such a weak state that theyre reluctant to operate on him

7481197 ystein turned after the bottleneck and descended to c4 the others continued half way up cecilie gave her bottle to rolf who progressed at a slower pace and summited without o2 with lars some time before 5 30 pm they talked to rolf from the summit and later met up with him on the way down on descent they started the tough sections in daylight rolf rappelled first down the bottleneck and went straight into the traverse cecilie was a bit behind lars stood above as cecilie started her traverse it was dark and she did not see what came but that rolfs headlamp went abruptly missing and she was thrown off balance as the rope was torn she knew immediately they had an emergency lightweight rope with them and with that she and lars were able to traverse and bring themselves down to c4 which they reached between 11 00 pm and midnight
7481198 the rest of climbers were hit by serac fall on the traverse and in the couloir section
7481199 recovery wont be short but otherwise i trust i am going to make it
7481200 its not just the physical pain images and memories will stay with me for a long time i refuse to speak about responsibilities neither about blame least of all if referred to others
7481201 i can only reflect about what have i done and being lucky enough to have returned alive learn from it therell be plenty of time for that
7481202 i think its fun and that is why i stay with this job
7481203 its been one year since we attended cecilies and rolfs wedding so it will be a sad farewell to a man who did so much but never had time for books talks or fame best of all he was never sad to miss a summit or a goal as long as a real and good challenge awaited up the road

7481220 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time
7481221 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits
7481222 madonnas apparent swipe at mccain came during a performance of the song
7481223 when i was first offered the job id say people were about 80 20 against the idea
7481224 and ive got to confess that if youd asked me what i thought about the doors going on the road with a new singer id have said it was a ridiculous idea but ive always loved morrison and the doors so i obviously felt flattered and honoured
7481225 i probably first heard them when i was nine or 10 on my parents transistor radio
7481226 at the time i loved david bowie and t rex but i was drawn to the doors they were so different so much darker
7481227 we needed the money so i couldnt afford not to
7481228 my grandmother was in a spiritualist church and i grew up in a kind of pagan household
7481229 id become everything i used to hate if i was 17 years old and id seen myself walking down the street at 27 i probably would have crossed the street and spat on myself
7481230 i love the tribal barbaric element of real raw music when everyone stops looking around and locks into a communal celebration
7481231 the challenge was to win the audiences hearts and minds
7481232 and as soon as people saw i had the right amount of reverence putting the music and the heritage of morrison first they felt more confident about it
7481233 its not a matter of impersonation more a question of recycling a classic body of work it is not about recreating what the doors were then but about robby and ray wanting to play the music for one last hurrah it would be painful for them if it fell on its face because it is their legacy but it was a once in a lifetime opportunity for me and i would rather have a go than wonder what might have happened
7481234 when they play they hit something deep within you and i am sure morrison must have felt that too
7481235 i guess i must have tuned in to some of the things he tuned in to sometimes i come off stage and feel like i need an exorcism

7481237 its a perennial problem that wont be addressed overnight the value that marketers deliver from a business standpoint is not being taken into account
7481238 it has to do with marketing being a whole lot more than communications and branding and about analytics customer integration market dynamics metrics and measures
7481239 the general feeling is that university programmes are not developing young talent there is a paucity of talent
7481240 everyone is competing for talent we can also export some of the best practices here clearly marketing innovation in africa is something we should be shining a light on
7481241 there are competencies that south african companies have developed that can be taken abroad to other emerging markets the idea is to build a training programme that is very hands on here bringing in senior global marketers to help cultivate marketing executives in this country and develop younger echelon folk
7481242 we think we can be a catalyst to help this come together to try activate this dormant repository of knowledge in the marketing industry
7481243 that is not our aim cmo is by invite only for leading marketers we bring a different perspective global best practice we want senior strategic decision makers and to engage them our programme is all about intellectual capacity we want to invite the whole industry to participate we also want to talk to business leaders on their views on marketing and deficiencies and requirements in the industry
7481244 we are a content channel we capture knowledge and insight and work with senior marketing folks to define best practice create models and build advocacy programmes
7481245 they are measuring the wrong things pr people want to measure media exposure number of clippings generated but how does that impact selling cycle product buying my pipeline my deal flow number of enquiries visitors to my website etc
7481246 marketing includes market share revenue gains stock price moves customer affinity customer churn attachment customer acquisition do you have a strategy for penetration what is your strategy for growing customer share
7481247 a lot of what im talking about does not require advertising spend more heavy lifting from the front end is required one doesnt have to spend big bucks today to be more precise and surgical there are a variety of different personalisation programmes with better returns more precise and efficient engagement with the market agencies dont want that their business model wont support that level of drilled down analysis the first thing agencies ask is whats your budget and then craft their campaign around that
7481248 marketers need to understand that the train is leaving the station and they need to get on it or they will be disintermediated agencies are scrambling to get on it as there are a whole new crop of interactive more flexible agencies out there
7481249 internationally we are imploding that structure imploding functional fiefdoms where everyone is competing for a different piece of budget it is all about having a master strategy based on a dose of customer analytics and real time tracking and monitoring of conditions to be constantly agile and adjustable to know where to direct dollars and which platforms to support marketers need to go back to the customer so when you go into a boardroom youre going in there with strategy analysis thinking based and grounded in substance not emotion or creative flash lots of business is based on creative accolades that are not based on converting business to transactions
7481250 wed like to see additional representation from some of the other market sectors over the coming months in particular fmcg financial services retail motor and healthcare in addition to growing sector representation our next phase of growth is going to be expanding our board to include representatives from all african countries and id like to see this happen by year end

7481300 i dont hardly ever water because i know theyre short on water
7481301 we gotta think of the reservoirs and the rest of the population you know
7481302 weve seen up to a 15 percent decrease in water usage compared to this time last year
7481303 weve even put little stickers on certain papers to continue to reinforce the message of conservation and voluntary restrictions to use water efficiently
7481304 weve also had a billboard a few billboards throughout the community and we hope that those messages are taken seriously
7481305 which in effect has given us 2 6 billion gallons more for the spartanburg county water supply
7481306 overall the class of our players is quite high and we could be higher up in the table
7481307 we dont have too many problems game wise yet zenit are suffering from a lack of emotion and from overconfidence towards the opposition which comes from the considerable achievements weve had lately
7481308 in austria and switzerland i did not play a single minute
7481309 if not for this i would count this bronze medal as the biggest prize but for me the most important achievement was the uefa cup while the russian league comes second
7481310 it would be incorrect of me to talk about it
7481311 we must first win and then talk about this subject especially given that we have to face united whose name speaks for itself
7481312 to be honest i have long waited for and thought about the super cup and russian league matches do not distract me from this
7481313 no additional motivation is needed for such a match most of the players get only one chance to win a game like this and we will try to make the most of it
7481314 if they have a good match they play phenomenal football if not they can have problems still the class of their players is so high that even when not on form they can display stability and achieve good results
7481315 this is a man with extraordinary technique and considerable charisma for me personally though edwin van der sar is a fantastic player the man is 37 but he keeps himself in excellent shape and is top class i think many keepers envy this
7481316 i consider him the best midfielder in the russian league and he can become a very useful member of our team i see danny as an attacking midfielder or winger
7481317 no because andrei is still with zenit and i am still not sure if he is going away
7481318 we are doing our best to break their nexus with the locals and we feel that we have been successful to a large extent

7481328 its difficult to know the effect on his psychological well being when he grasps the full truth that his education will be followed by approximately four decades of work bills and taxes during which he will also rear his own children to face the same fate all of which will of course be followed by a brief almost inconsequential retirement and his inevitable death

7481330 this looks like a step backward for obama cnn polling director keating holland says

7481332 the number of clinton democrats who say they would vote for mccain has gone up 11 points since june enough to account for most although not all of the support mccain has gained in that time

7481350 fourth the president must direct the military to design a plan for withdrawing and redeploying our troops from iraq by 2008
7481351 this choice of biden is disappointing because he is the creator of the idea of dividing iraq
7481352 we rejected his proposal when he announced it and we still reject it dividing the communities and land in such a way would only lead to new fighting between people over resources and borders iraq cannot survive unless it is unified and dividing it would keep the problems alive for a long time

7481367 quattro giorni fa sono arrivata a palermo citt culturalmente cos distante dal mio modo di vedere e vivere le cose a palermo limmondizia ovunque il traffico cos pesante da scoraggiare ad uscire di casa in auto e tante tante cose che mi portano a combattere tra amore per il sud e odio per certe cose il mio referente di stage il carismatico francesco p paragona questa citt a napoli e per certi versi la ritiene anche peggio il degrado ovunque ma nonostante case e palazzi fatiscenti allinterno dei miniappartamenti si trovano spesso televisori al plasma e quantaltro di super tecnologico lassociazione per cui sto cercando di portare avanti un progetto mi da la possibilit di gestire come voglio il mio tempo quindi non ho un orario di lavoro e non ho nessuno che propriamente mi corregga nonostante ci sono affascinata da quello che dovrebbe risultare dal mio stage ammesso che io riesca a trovare i contatti giusti con il mio tirocinio dovrei pensare alla promo commercializzazione di un pacchetto turistico in tanzan a partir per supervisionare il tour africano tra dieci giorni circa carica di tante speranze ma anche non lo nego di un po di timore per il viaggio tulime unassociazione che nasce per la cooperazione allo sviluppo e da un anno ha predisposto questo pacchetto che dovrei rivedere e magari modificare ci sono in ballo tante piccole azioni di comunicazione ma soprattutto porr attenzione al mondo della distribuzione perci lancer un sos al mitico calz per una buona causa

7481373 the additional responsibility for shuja emphasises hiltons diligent focus on realising saudi arabias tourism potential within the gcc and internationally
7481374 we are confident in his new role shuja will prove to be the driving force for the hilton brands and to realise our aggressive development objectives in the kingdom
7481375 there is no doubt saudi arabia has the potential to redefine hiltons future growth in the region

7481377 hospitality executives these days are very driven and want to learn how to practically apply theory
7481378 i had a lot of questions when it came to the revenue management control aspect especially the maintenance aspect which we take for granted the course showed me how to analyze the numbers to see how much better we can maximize our opportunities to make money
7481379 we have been testing and i have been enjoying it which is my main goal right now
7481380 i wanted to enjoy racing again and riding a bike and after that when i started to go fast i impressed myself
7481381 i am open to whatever but first of all i want to have fun but after having fun and getting competitive i have to have my way to come back it doesnt mean it is the correct way but it has to be my way and if it does happen my way then maybe i will come back
7481382 there is still a chance maybe but you never know like i said i want to enjoy every day whatever happens is great and i am open to whatever happens
7481383 there are some other options so we will just have to see what happens right now
7481384 tsm improvvisamente si svuotata per mesi i corridoi e le aule erano il regno degli studenti del master e ora tutto tace
7481385 we dont want this to be just one event rather a series of events that come together
7481386 we know that oak ridge is much more than just the last 10 years but this year gives us a reason to celebrate
7481387 its always been about people and what makes oak ridge special and not just the incorporation

7481394 we are extremely pleased to be opening up a route into abu dhabi as the city and emirate represents a key market as we move to extend our international network
7481395 we are certain that the abu dhabi pakistan route will serve a growing number of passengers between our two countries and we are hopeful that demand will see us able to increase our frequencies to and from the uae capital in a short period of time
7481396 we are of course pleased to welcome airblue to abu dhabi on this unique occasion but it is also pleasing to note that their arrival is reason for further celebration in that the airline becomes the 40th airline to operate from abu dhabi international airport in line with the expansion and planning efforts it is clear that an ever increasing number of commercial carriers are seeing the benefits of operating from the uae capital and emirate of abu dhabi
7481397 this in turn provides greater accessibility to key destinations worldwide and importantly greater choice for all our existing and future passengers
7481398 we are glad to be able to revise some of our fares with the recent lowering of fuel prices although fuel prices have fallen gradually in recent weeks it is still some 60 above the average price per barrel in 2007 high fuel prices continue to be a big challenge for emirates and we are monitoring the situation closely
7481399 with the middle easts business aviation sector set to continue its annual double digit growth over the next five years we are gearing up to handle an even higher level of new business
7481400 much of our business is involved with both engineering and technical aspects line maintenance logistics flight management and aircraft acquisition for instance and these two appointments are part of our wider on going programme of recruitment and restructuring that will ensure we are able to continue to deliver the right product and service to customers whilst improving our processes and reducing costs
7481401 if we get the answers from them aqua well work with them 100 percent if not well look for other channels
7481402 with such a positive response we decided to make our garden art available to the public
7481403 we are investigating whether he is operating a business out of a residential property a location not zoned for commercial retail sales
7481404 what it comes down to in this particular case is is it artwork or commercial sales if he wants them to be art as weve currently classified them they cannot be offered for sale
7481405 the town council took the unusual step of requesting a meeting between staff developer and residents of the neighborhood to attempt to negotiate a settlement of the case
7481406 we prefer to present this special facility to the public when there is some grass and landscaping and when it better resembles a park
7481407 i dont know if they were ever that excessive but the perception is there

7481409 my personal experience is that people around here are very conservative with water especially when they have to pay for it
7481410 the ones that do id assume would be the older wells under 50 feet deep that depend on runoff
7481411 with that being said id still encourage people not to waste water
7481412 per fare turismo bisogna avere piedi nel fango e testa nelle stelle
7481413 it doesnt really matter who gets in the new president is in for a very hard time it doesnt take too many more hundreds of billions in bailouts to be more than the taxpayers can handle
7481414 private industry is where the innovations need to come from
7481415 obama is a great talker but can he lead congress into the right moves to salvage the economy
7481416 no matter who wins the november election the economy will not improve overnight
7481417 we must find a way for the national government as well as state and local government to cut out the wasteful spending bring jobs back to america and find alternative energy sources
7481418 i do not like the war stance of mccain but have economic issues with more government programs and other democrat obama economics
7481419 more government in our lives and erode freedoms plus we know what happens to programs run by the government
7481420 it appears that the past eight years have resulted in one of the worst economies in decades the highest deficit severely damaged international reputation and the lowest support for womens rights since the 1970s
7481421 a positive but short lived effect on our countrys economy
7481422 i have been a grocery shopper for 50 years and i am dismayed at how much prices are rising
7481423 something must be done and soon and i am not sure a new president is the answer i keep listening to mccain and obamas plans to help our economy but wonder just how much they can do
7481424 once student enrollment settles often this is not until a week or two into the school year i will examine our needs as a total school facility and make decisions regarding how the mobile units can best accommodate these needs
7481425 durante lrbl research based learning si presentata loccasione di intervistare un motociclista ireneo comparin rider anche in vacanza
7481426 dal parcheggio sicuro per le moto ad una colazione sostanziosa dagli orari della cucina ad una stanza dove poter asciugare i vestiti
7481427 noi motociclisti in vacanza cerchiamo strade che non ci sono
7481428 percorrere in moto chilometri nel silenzio dei propri pensieri viene ripagato dal sorriso di una persona lunica che magari incontri durante tutta la giornata e da un tramonto tra le dune del deserto
7481429 the meeting was an effort to get feedback from neighbors
7481430 it was an effort to get input on our plan in a collaborative manner
7481431 it is important that we try to address the concerns of our neighbors the community and the town of summerfield the meeting on the 31st was the first step in that process
7481432 just how many grocery stores do we need in this area anyway
7481433 we already have a walgreens going up 100 yards from a cvs with a food lion behind it i thought this was summerfield not wendover avenue
7481434 if it were flat i would be much less concerned but that septic field slopes downward and could seep into the water systems it just doesnt stand to reason that that would work
7481435 the developer said they did a traffic study and this development wouldnt impact traffic by more than about two seconds
7481436 we are clearly taking those comments seriously thats really the stage were in now with the planning process
7481437 i understand peoples concerns about the negatives and redundancies associated with the proposed harris teeter in summerfield
7481438 summerfield was incorporated to provide protection from annexation by the city of greensboro and incursion of high density development
7481439 why in the world would we want this mess in summerfield
7481440 remember that the citizens of summerfield have the right under north carolina general statute 160 a 385 and 386 to file a protest petition to the summerfield city council
7481441 here we go again a group of big money investors trying to make summerfield more than just a nice place to raise a family
7481442 i think this development is a wonderful opportunity for the town
7481443 commercial development should include the highest density high impact uses at the major node intersections while lower density low impact uses should be located at the minor nodes and town core areas
7481444 due to its physical constraints it is unlikely that study areas would support large scale industrial or retail development
7481445 please be advised that this property is in fact not located at an intersection
7481446 hmm good ideas summerfield will just keep being known as a bedroom community and we all can benefit from those higher gas prices on those commute times to work in greensboro and we all know what a high water mark food lion is
7481447 why dont we just call this the lake brandt 400 raceway i can see it now bumber to bumper into turn 3
7481448 il xxi secolo appartiene allasia e le olimpiadi di pechino ne sono il simbolo pi appropriato

7481453 come temevamo le olimpiadi di pechino sono state un periodo utile per compiere arresti condanne censure controlli e persecuzioni nei confronti di oltre cento giornalisti blogger e dissidenti

7481462 we wanted an area where the school districts were good based on state ratings
7481463 we found there were too many other people waiting for the same thing
7481464 were trying to offer to folks for multiple kinds of uses a reliable environment that can be used for varying types of purposes so were kind of the wholesalers of space
7481465 this is a little bit like if you build it they will come
7481466 the testing already indicates were definitely on the right track
7481467 our ambition and goal for this new building is to be able to handle the fabrication of two full standards per year and one possibly two propulsion buses and docking nodes per year
7481468 in some ways we would prefer being close to our launch facilities but there could be various ways to make it so attractive that locating away from those launch facilities is advantageous to go ahead and pay for shipping everything else
7481469 were not ready to do this next week but we know that its coming
7481470 the quantity of spacecraft we can produce is hugely a function of how much room we have to work in
7481471 when we start to rock and roll we need to really move out
7481472 if we dont do that were going to be ok
7481473 if were going to put our clients on boosters i want to damn well be sure that theres significant amount of seconds on testing of a motor configuration
7481474 i applaud the efforts of lockheed martin and the efforts of space exploration technologies corp

7481477 triggered star formation continues to be very hard to prove
7481478 but our preliminary analysis shows that the phenomenon can explain the multiple generations of stars seen in the w5 region
7481479 its due to our proactive policing tactics its because of our use of stop and search at points of entry
7481480 you would expect more arrests because were searching more people
7481481 i am grateful for the fact that i have a wonderful life i spent some years without a kitchen table without a chair and i know what its like to be blessed by the opportunities of this great nation cindys father who barely finished high school went off and distinguished himself in world war ii in a b 17 and came back with practically nothing and realized the american dream and i am proud and grateful for that

7481486 it is in this gathering of discontent that my candidacy intends to find its voice

7481505 so it has to be the cd that is faulty have you tried cleaning it
7481506 we have to realise that the palm oil price is also dependent on the drop in the mineral oil price
7481507 so its not surprising that palm oil drops to a level that is more reflective of its intrinsic value
7481508 i think prices will remain around the present level for some time it will find its right level hopefully at this 2 600 ringgit level
7481509 while there is nothing wrong in any nigerian showing or expressing support for any of the candidates for the us presidential election it becomes a different ball game when such a person is a public or quasi public official whose interest could be misconstrued as an indication of the governments thinking it said

7481629 i have a pass to get in but i was told there was no way i could get on to the site
7481630 it seems it was not open to the general public and only people who already had camping wristbands
7481631 it is really quite ridiculous so many people have come out for the show and lots of the people who live nearby turned up but they could not actually get on to the site
7481632 some of the people have been left really angry about it i made a special journey with the family to see the parade and i just dont understand what went on
7481633 it is part of our licensing agreement that the site is closed at 6pm and only people with wristbands and camping passes could stay on the site
7481634 we never let members of the public on to the site at night but people could still watch along the towpaths and bridges

7481640 one of the main things which will be discussed is car parking in wombourne we feel there should be tighter controls on the parking already there and there are some areas of land which we believe can be turned into new long stay car parks because parking can be a problem
7481641 we are also asking for the village to be better maintained its things like trimming back hedges and generally making the best of it
7481642 its things we can all work together to do to make wombourne more attractive

7481683 people are becoming more aware of the negative effects of conventional pesticides at the same time growers are more willing to switch they have more choices and incentive compared to 10 years ago
7481684 i think there has been enough scientific evidence that theres a difference between lets say conventional tomatoes and organic tomatoes in terms of pesticide residues but also improved taste and higher levels of antioxidants

7481686 anticancer research is aimed at understanding the molecular pathways that can be selectively targeted to halt tumor growth
7481687 we know that the mtor pathway is activated in many cancers and therefore is a good target for fighting a wide array of tumors
7481688 we analyzed tissue from human biopsies as well as cancer cell lines and genetically engineered mouse models of cancer
7481689 this study inserts a new piece of information into the puzzle of the effects of mtorc1 inhibitors in cell signaling
7481690 furthermore because there are inhibitors of mapk pathway already approved for the treatment of cancer it provides us with the rationale for using combinations of mtorc1 and mapk inhibitors in attacking tumors thereby offering cancer patients another treatment option with immediate applicability

7481729 it was very frustrating they came on to collect the passports at 5 30am all they had to do was stamp them but they took forever to process them some people couldnt even get off the boat because the authorities wouldnt give their passports back they were just stuck on the boat then they insisted on checking them all again the captain was furious

7481742 obamas stadium address on thursday the 45th anniversary of rev martin luther king jr s i have a dream speech will result in effusive and overwhelming press coverage this coverage will be impenetrable and will undoubtedly impact the polls
7481743 the one returns this time to lead us to the road to denver
7481744 we will encourage voters to look beyond the glamour of barack obamas celebrity status to his inexperience and lack of accomplishment
7481745 even democrats in ohio are calling on senator obama to offer something more than a lofty speech ohioans are beginning to wonder if theres anything more to barack obama than his trusty teleprompter
7481746 hiding out in one of your seven houses while your surrogates launch more low road attacks is not a surprising strategy for john mccain
7481747 but given his shocking disconnect with the struggles of american families john mccain would be better served using this time to rewrite his economic plan that was authored by an adviser who thinks we are a nation of whiners and which offers nothing more than the same failed bush economic policies of the last eight years

7481876 the general idea is an old one that any two cells or systems of cells that are repeatedly active at the same time will tend to become associated so that activity in one facilitates activity in the other
7481877 when one cell repeatedly assists in firing another the axon of the first cell develops synaptic knobs or enlarges them if they already exist in contact with the soma of the second cell
7481878 if the inputs to a system cause the same pattern of activity to occur repeatedly the set of active elements constituting that pattern will become increasingly strongly interassociated that is each element will tend to turn on every other element and with negative weights to turn off the elements that do not form part of the pattern to put it another way the pattern as a whole will become auto associated we may call a learned auto associated pattern an engram

7481890 when i lost ekim i wanted him back i had come to expect him in my life we breathed the same air surfed the same waves watched the same sunsets when he never returned from that sail lost at sea wasnt enough i wanted him back i wanted him back badly

7482325 die entscheidung des olympischen komitees im jahr 2007 die neue sponsorenkategorie
7482326 nachdem man uns diese aufgabe erteilt hatte entschieden wir dass es aufgrund der zeitknappheit dem umfang und der komplexit t des schulungsprogramms am effektivsten sei uns bei der ausbildung der freiwilligen helfer auf diejenigen sprachlichen und anderen kenntnisse zu konzentrieren die sie mit hoher wahrscheinlichkeit w hrend der olympischen und paralympischen spiele ben tigen w rden

7482328 im mai habe ich am sprachtrainingsprogramm f r studenten teilgenommen
7482329 ich war schon sechs mal bei den olympischen spielen mit dabei und ich muss sagen dass die olympischen spiele in peking wesentlich besser verlaufen sind als ich erwartet hatte alle freiwilligen sind sehr zuvorkommend und haben mir immer weiterhelfen k nnen die meisten sprechen fliessend englisch ich hatte nicht erwartet dass sie so gute sprachkenntnisse haben w rden oder dass sie sich derart professionell um die besucher k mmern w rden

7482353 the closed primary system that we have now has been working for us and opening the primary is going to create more problems than its going to solve
7482354 the time and resources of the legislature are already strained by efforts to deal with the critical issues facing oregon such as education public safety and others measure 65 would make it easy for groups or individuals to literally paralyze the legislative process by referring large numbers of administrative rules
7482355 one of the concerns is that the top two primary will reduce participation and washington could be one of many examples of that
7482356 its basically taking a choice away from the voters by pushing out any of the smaller parties
7482357 it will also guarantee there will probably never be another republican on the general ballot in multnomah county ever there will only be two democrats to choose from so much for diversity and choice
7482358 the end of the republican party as we knew it
7482359 this fall in washington for example no republicans are even running for attorney general or the fourth congressional district in the upcoming november election
7482360 thats when people look to see the lawn signs come out and start reading the voters pamphlet
7482361 slowly but surely americans are being denied fair elections as it is the system already favors the two major political parties both of which have been taken over by liberal left politicians and activists

7482366 php is not a new language it doesnt introduce any new concepts this means that training programmers who already know any c c perl or even java to write php code is quite easy i tend to look for people with c or c skills when i go looking for php developers for a project the thinking being that you are much better off hiring experienced programmers than you would be if you hired someone who necessarily knows a lot about php if they can handle those languages php will be trivial for them of course if they have experience with both so much the better
7482367 i dont need devs who doesnt know the creator of his language chances are higher he wont know the name of the man behind his company

7482370 deep tagging allows you to highlight the moment when a certain person or place appears in the video or mark a specific event captured in your video so your viewers can skip right to the stuff they really want to see you can even use deep tags to divide your video into chapters

7482428 it was intended to be partly in jest and partly irony i was trying to suggest that we really have entered a period when things are a lot less private think of the ease with which photos and videos can be taken digitized shipped around on the internet posted on youtube or its equivalent
7482429 nothing you do ever goes away and nothing you do ever escapes notice

7482455 if you listen to the alliances it means consumer benefits out the wazoo
7482456 if you look at what they are saying to wall street it says the ability to coordinate schedules and pricing which means eliminating low fare excess capacity which would seem to be inherently not consumer friendly
7482457 there is something more than just the reduction in driving that has to be brought in as an explanation for the huge drop in fatalities
7482458 there were lots of people like me who slapped their foreheads and said why didnt i think of that
7482459 people knew that for some of these stream ciphers they could express the output as a formula of the key
7482460 the council had decided in 1977 that the hall would be demolished but the people of bilston came together and said no we dont want it ripped down
7482461 everyone came together to fight for what they wanted and this is the reason the hall is still here
7482462 customers who were attending the stadium on their family evening out were alarmed at the violence caused by protesters
7482463 there are regular protests from animal rights activists and there is a history of disruption as they try and stop cars getting in
7482464 this guy was just doing his job trying to keep the traffic flowing in and he was just set upon
7482465 he has worked at monmore green for around 10 years and he is the nicest man you could wish to meet so it came as a big shock what had happened
7482466 there is nothing wrong at all with anybody holding peaceful protests to get their views across but this has crossed the line and shocked a lot of the customers
7482467 we are not expecting him back at work for a couple of weeks but he will definitely be back eventually
7482468 it was really successful and the standard of entries was very impressive considering it has been a bad growing year
7482469 we were pleased with the number of people who came along and everybody seemed impressed especially the judge
7482470 they havent cancelled any appointments but it has been really unsatisfactory in terms of aftercare
7482471 the patients are still coming in but they have been going to a short stay ward the fact is the patients are all being squashed together in the ward
7482472 seven staff have left since march over the last year a lot of staff have had to re apply for jobs a lot of staff felt uncertain about the security of their jobs so they have looked elsewhere
7482473 it was a planned closure and the decision was made in response to this being a peak period for holidays for doctors and nurses
7482474 we have still been able to provide the same service by moving patients to other departments we have a short stay surgery just next door and have managed fine
7482475 the day care surgery will be back open on september 1
7482476 no care has been cancelled as a result of the decision and no services have suffered because we have used other elected wards to take on the patients
7482477 it still hasnt hit me really everyone is just so excited about it
7482478 i never got to meet my granddad but he and my nan were always at the heart of our family
7482479 my brother michael even has the photo tattooed across his back my family have always been very proud of our black country roots my grandfather especially so this is a great tribute to him
7482480 we dont really know much about it we know he was in the army so we think it must have been there that he took it up
7482481 he was a teenager in the 1920s so its likely that he fought in the war but he never talked about that so i dont even know if he was sent anywhere or where he served
7482482 when i sent in the picture i didnt even realise it was a competition i just knew they needed all these pictures so thought id help out and so i emailed it over
7482483 that is the only picture weve got of him when he was a young man so it is really important to us
7482484 i had all the old photographs of our family scanned into the computer as i didnt want to lose any of them
7482485 that photograph is in all the grandchildrens houses and all the family has a copy
7482486 it is an iconic image for all of us and it is like our familys own piece of artwork
7482487 the aim of the big picture was to encourage as many different people to get involved
7482488 we know from the thousands of photographs we received that sport plays a huge part in the lives of people living in this region so i think its particularly fitting that the selection of the final image has enabled us to celebrate our sporting heritage with this amazing transformation

7482492 the whole thing is under this big shroud of secrecy im used to it now though because heroes is the same way
7482493 it was a really rewarding experience you know challenging and exciting and everyday was something new and the scale of it was pretty epic so we had a really good time j j abrams managed to keep it all about what we had in front of us everyday even though we were in the mist of something sort of huge and life changing and hopefully really impatful it felt like we knew what we had to go do everyday at work so that was cool
7482494 you know its funny because actually in the movie in the climax of the movie when spock actually oh

7482499 do you think there should be a gc in leipzig in 2009
7482500 anyone who has experienced the enthusiastic mood in the exhibition halls over the last seven years knows this fair belongs in leipzig
7482501 the fairs and conferences in leipzig are becoming increasingly international and attract more and more visitors were pleased with this development i completely agree with the governor of the free state of saxony stanislaw tillich that we will do everything to help this new cultural sector and the gc games convention to achieve further success
7482502 there was absolutely no noise it was very disturbing we only had time to swerve to the right before being mown down

7482557 obama has picked someone who is going to be very aggressive in going after mccain and who is not going to be recalcitrant about it
7482558 if i was mccain id be thinking about my own attack dog
7482559 hes going to want someone who can go toe to toe with biden
7482560 certainly biden was a big choice for obama and it does therefore force mccain to think about a big choice both in terms of debates and the potential demographic or state by state advantages in who he picks for his running mate

7482569 what i feel is missing from our screens is a channel that encourages adventurism and experimentation backed by money
7482570 a channel that becomes home of the best programme makers the best writers the best directors and most visionary producers and format creators a channel that becomes a brand for what is new and surprising but not compromised by the pressures of advertising or too tightly targeted an audience
7482571 uninhibited by the need to placate advertisers the subscription networks have been given the opportunity to experiment but on a big rather than timid scale

7482573 lets take a wager that the bbc brand is the best tv brand in the world that people will pay for that brand
7482574 let it hold on to all of its free channels and radio stations but let it also build a new subscription service that will provide the very best in what the british television industry the best in the world can do
7482575 theres too much at stake too vital a contribution to our culture to let its critics start to pull it apart now i want it to fight back with all the energy and resources it has more specifically i want it to plug a gap i still see in the british tv market one which once filled can give the individual programme maker the impetus to make the distinctive the surprising the lavish the intimate the experimental unhampered by the constraints the bbc normally has to operate under

7482577 n r man skal certificeres s er det for at undg situationer hvor en dansk underviser kun pr sterer 70 procent af hvad han egentlig kan fordi det foreg r p et fremmedsprog
7482578 derfor mener vi ogs at universiteterne skal udarbejde en forpligtende sprogstrategi hvor man g r rede for hvorfor og hvorn r de bruger engelsk s det ikke bare bliver en automatpilot men man reflekterer over hvorn r man bruger det ene og det andet og samtidig kan man sikre kvaliteten af engelsk de steder hvor man fortsat bruger det
7482579 skal forskerne certificeres af hvem skal vi s oprette et statskontrolleret certificeringsorgan med kommiss rer der g r rundt og tjekker om vi taler godt nok engelsk det lyder som meget gammeldags
7482580 det her bidrager til at g re vores hverdag endnu mere kompliceret de konservative plejer at sige vi skal have mere frihed men det her er stik modsat
7482581 jeg er mere liberalt indstillet p den m de at jeg har tiltro til at universiteterne selv kan klare problemstillingen de ved at der er fokus p omr det og jeg mener i hvert fald at de selv skal have mulighed at vise at de magter opgaven inden vi g r ind og kr ver certifikater og indf rer get kontrol
7482582 det lyder som et voldsomt bureaukrati hvis alle lektorer skal certificeres og selv om det er fornuftigt at t nke over hvorn r og hvordan man bruger hvilke sprog s er jeg ikke tilh nger af at man kr ver forpligtende strategier det tror jeg godt universiteterne selv kan l se
7482583 vi er enige i at der er et problem men den her m de at l se det p er pr get af mistillid til at universiteterne selv kan finde ud af det jeg tror at test og ekstern evaluering vil virke stik modsat det vil bare g re de i forvejen h rdt pressede universitetsansatte endnu mere frustrerede
7482584 s dan er det jo men det er s samfundsm ssigt v sentligt at dansk fortsat er et forskningssprog og at vi ikke s nker niveauet p grund af sprogbarrierer at vi m sige den chance t r vi ikke at tage
7482585 forslaget fra de konservative ligger helt i forl ngelse af mange af de forslag vi er kommet med i vores rapport og de er alle meget n dvendige for der er virkelig et problem p de videreg ende uddannelser
7482586 jeg mener der er brug for en ndring af universitetsloven der er brug for en bindende bestemmelse som sikrer at dansk ogs fremover er et sprog der bruges p universiteterne
7482587 jeg er helt enig med m lene i teksten lige nu k rer der to sprog side om side og der skal vi sikre at det ene sprog ikke bliver marginaliseret og til sidst helt falder ud s dan som vi ser det p eksempelvis dtu og life p k benhavns universitet hvor man bevidst arbejder p at bruge mere og mere engelsk
7482588 jeg synes det er en god id at lave en forpligtende sprogstrategi og at certificere de forskere der skal undervise p engelsk men der er ogs brug for at vi tager skridtet fuldt ud og ndrer universitetsloven
7482589 der st r i regeringens sprogpolitik fra 2004 at dansk skal v re hovedundervisningssproget p universiteterne alligevel ser vi at antallet af engelsksprogede uddannelser stiger og stiger og man skal ikke v re sp mand for at kunne se hvordan det her ender s den frie model er afpr vet og derfor m der en lov ndring til
7482590 prisen er for h j dels i form af fagligt niveautab i formidlingen dels i form af konsekvenser for det danske sprog hvis universitetet bliver et sted hvor man kun taler engelsk s f r vi et opdelt samfund med en elite der kommunikerer p engelsk og en rest som ikke g r

7482601 the agency lacks the budget the statutory authority and the scientific expertise to ensure the hundreds of nanoproducts now on the market are safe
7482602 this problem will only worsen as more sophisticated nanotechnology based products begin to enter the consumer market

7482604 the cpsc the agency primarily responsible for the oversight of these toys was stretched too thin from years of neglect underfunding and the challenges posed by an increasingly global manufacturing system
7482605 it is against this background that we need to ask the question is the cpsc adequately prepared to deal with nanotechnology
7482606 it took decades of research before lawmakers found the political will to keep lead and phthalates out of toys
7482607 it could take a very long time to research and ensure that potentially dangerous nanomaterials are kept out too

7482620 our ambition and goal for this new building is to be able to handle the fabrication of two full standards per year and one possibly two propulsion buses and docking nodes per year
7482621 in some ways we would prefer being close to our launch facilities but there could be various ways to make it so attractive that locating away from those launch facilities is advantageous to go ahead and pay for shipping everything else
7482622 were not ready to do this next week but we know that its coming
7482623 the quantity of spacecraft we can produce is hugely a function of how much room we have to work in

7482661 we just hope that the surgery goes well on tuesday and that it is a full recovery and that he is even better than ever here shortly down the road
7482662 as for the rest of us we received this information sunday morning it was probably around noon i think when i talked to dr russell warren and it was obviously the news i didnt want to hear but after listening to the explanation and dr warrens thoughts on it i am convinced that this is the right procedure the right way to go
7482663 i tried to talk to the coaches about it and i assured the coaches that we will have to be at our best because our team will know before they come in here tomorrow because of the media and we have to do a great job of getting our players refocused and our thoughts on going forward
7482664 it is an extensive injury that takes considerable time i have heard it said four months but again probably each individual is somewhat different the doctors have told me that this will be a four month recovery
7482665 if the giants make a sincere overture its a good chance that strahan would consider coming back
7482666 there are other things he has to take into consideration the money and his contract with fox but if the giants really want him they have a shot its not out of the question
7482667 would i like michael to be a new york giant this season absolutely absolutely will he be i have no idea i dont even want to put a percentage on it but if one of the potential solutions is to reach out to michael worst case its certainly worth a phone call
7482668 im sure michael is happy with fox but he obviously loves the giants too
7482669 if theyre interested in talking to him hed discuss it with them but right now as i see it youll be watching him on fox this year

7482676 this year were ready to go we have only four seniors but the four we have are quality players
7482677 jace has been in the program for four years and hes a thrower
7482678 he has a shot at being one of the best quarterbacks in the league
7482679 it seems like four months since i won a game
7482680 felix had strep throat and two days ago didnt look good at all
7482681 he was tough today he took a big step forward he pitched sick gave us six good innings after the sixth though he was done
7482682 second time it was a good pitch he was just swinging good today
7482683 i was playing third so adrian beltre could dh and rest his shoulder
7482684 i cant try to be beltre i can only be myself i try to be ready
7482685 there are a lot of things id like to work on
7482686 situational football red zone no turnovers getting the ball out of bounds and getting into the tempo after having not played for a year even just getting the formations out of my mouth as the game went on it got a lot smoother for me and those were just a few things that i learned
7482687 you know at some point in time in all of our careers we are going to win our last golf tournament
7482688 when you win it you obviously dont think thats going to be your last one because youre on a high
7482689 not very consistent it was a little frustrating and very trying
7482690 the pace was too fast i had endurance but not speed i have to work on my speed
7482691 i tried to cope with the front runners but they proved too fast it is sad that i could not even qualify for the world championships
7482692 i will make sure i take part in a marathon within the next four months to be able to make it to berlin for the world championships i will also have to compete in more 10km and 15km races
7482693 the olympic spirit lives in the warm embrace of competitive rivals from nations in conflict keep that spirit alive when you return home these were truly exceptional games
7482694 and now i declare the games of the xxix olympiad closed and i call upon the youth of the world to assemble four years from now in london to celebrate the games of the xxx olympiad
7482695 some people may think this is a harsh decision but one thing i do know is the little things if you forget about them they add up to big things and they cause a lot of problems for your team
7482696 i messed up so its best for the team and im here for them
7482697 this is an opportunity for me to prove myself and showcase my skills and showcase my leadership so thats how im looking at it
7482698 robert marve will be the starter we will not have a controversy if a guy like jacory can go in and have a tremendous game robert marve still will be the starter we have to build depth at that position
7482699 i said to myself get in the fairway get on the green and give yourself a chance because putting is what i do best
7482700 i knew if i hit it good enough with the way i putt i knew id have a chance
7482701 that putt was a lot more difficult than the one i had in regulation
7482702 it broke a couple feet its a pretty amazing putt to make in a playoff

7482706 the evidence does establish that the ultra violet devices mark identifies a class of goods
7482707 the fact that the genus is conceptually broader than the identification of goods does not inexorably lead to the conclusion that in re central sprinkler co 49 uspq2d 1194 ttab 1998 attic generic for automatic fire sprinklers
7482708 conspicuous by its absence is any evidence showing the recognition of ultra violet devices as a mark by relevant consumers considering how highly descriptive applicants mark is direct evidence that the use and promotion of the mark has had an impact resulting in consumer recognition of the mark would have been far more probative than a mere declaration of 14 years of use and copies of some advertisements which merely report sales installations

7482714 hes got some major problems like internal bleeding and hes on dialysis so his kidneys are failing again and they are talking again about suspected pneumonia so they are three bad reports
7482715 everything is down and its not looking good but weve still got hope
7482716 it takes about 10 hours for us to get a result
7482717 its been something of a concern this new problem hes got and we hope this will overcome it for them to at least put the operation off for some time
7482718 i think its far too early to be speculating about that and i think it would be wrong of me given the very complex human issues at heart involved in this
7482719 this is about a child and an adoptive family thats gone out of their way and done their best to give a child a new life and to make a family

7482723 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7482724 we are in for a long battle as the floods have come in areas which are not prone to it

7482728 people kept telling me that the door to victory would finally open and today we broke through it
7482729 for me it was really fun pushing and pushing every lap for the entire race thats what its all about and thats what made us win we changed the plans lap by lap and we pitted when we thought we were going to slow down we never let our guard down
7482730 the attitude of those guys in the team is priceless
7482731 everyone has been working so hard since last wednesday taking cars to charlotte and bringing cars back from charlotte converting cars from oval to road course youre talking about two days work in 12 hours when you see guys doing that you just want to do your best
7482732 i dont know why we stayed out when the car in front of us is three seconds slower and we couldnt make up any track position we lost a ton of points this is a race thats very tough unfortunately we got the bad end of the stick hopefully well turn it around next time
7482733 one of the reasons for it was the debris that accumulated on the fence itself
7482734 while the bush administration may claim its taking environmental impacts of the border wall into consideration building wire mesh fences across washes prone to debris laden floods is fundamentally flawed
7482735 it doesnt take an expert hydrologist to anticipate the potential for these walls to become like dams
7482736 especially in flash flood type of storms where a lot of water and debris are generated very quickly and can pile up against the fences very rapidly
7482737 we are still required to follow every environmental rule regulation and policy
7482738 he does not waive us doing what we would have to do without the waiver so it doesnt change anything in the environment
7482739 the monument had suggested that they take into consideration everything that can happen with a weather event
7482740 we had a concern that this was going to happen
7482741 thats how you could quickly get into this darker scenario
7482742 if theres a consensus its probably that prices will fall another 10 percent between now and next summer which would be 25 percent down from peak to trough
7482743 another 10 percent down would put prices back consistent with rents and incomes thats a signal that housing affordability has been restored for most potential home buyers
7482744 in southern california we are still not near the bottom
7482745 you have cul de sacs in the antelope valley where every house is in foreclosure
7482746 the vulture buyers are going to be purchasing for as low as 30 cents on the dollar from the peak

7482749 the tone mr khamenei used to support mr ahmadinejad suggests that his intention was more than defending him against the attacks
7482750 it appears that mr ahmadinejad and mr khamenei share the same views over major policies and ideological values such as resisting the west and the nuclear policy
7482751 some bullying and demanding countries wanted to impose their will on our country
7482752 but our people and the president and his ministers stood up to such demands
7482753 we cant be satisfied with the way the country is being run
7482754 a country with abundant resources should not have gas cuts in winter and power cuts in summer or have people spending hours in line waiting at gas stations
7482755 perplexed by the modest silence on the belarusian side you need to express yourself more clearly on such issues
7482756 i just want the moskaly and khokhly derogatory terms for russians and ukrainians respectively to leave us to get on with our lives
7482757 for the 2010 presidential elections this is highly plausible as moscow will most likely be looking to diversify after its spectacular failure to fix the 2004 elections in favour of one candidate yanukovich
7482758 thats where we got the first indications that iran had acquired centrifuges
7482759 maybe that labyrinth held clues to another client or another rogue state

7482764 we could have respected the treaty by avoiding their publication and putting them under lock and key
7482765 if they had kept the material in federal possession for years why not keep holding it
7482766 the newspapers know more about these things than i do
7482767 no answers to the really interesting questions in this case

7482777 you sense a tougher environment a more restricted environment a more pessimistic environment its a moment of turmoil i think

7482857 the heresy of individualism thinking oneself a completely self sufficient unit and asserting this imaginary

7482859 i will be a better catholic not if i can refute every shade of protestantism but if i can affirm the truth in it and still go further
7482860 so too with the muslims the hindus the buddhists etc this does not mean syncretism indifferentism the vapid and careless friendliness that accepts everything by thinking of nothing there is much that one cannot affirm and accept but first one must say yes where one really can
7482861 if i affirm myself as catholic merely by denying all that is muslim jewish protestant hindu buddhist etc in the end i will find that there is not much left for me to affirm as a catholic and certainly no breath of the spirit with which to affirm it

7482913 i think theres only one dream team in my opinion
7482914 that dream team was something special something unique theres teams that could be close to it but not like that one that team changed a lot of things in basketball and made a lot of young players want to play basketball and want to dedicate themselves to the sport
7482915 i think this team is really very good and played at a very very high level all tournament and theyre close to that team but now i think theres nothing like that
7482916 but in a tight race we cant afford to lose a small number hopefully obama will bring in enough new and first time voters to offset that

7482948 once someone has made millions or billions what is their incentive i must add if money is the only driver then society becomes bagdad outside the green zone or gang controlled parts of the cities we can see how paris hiltons parents wealth has made paris hilton creative and industrious kenneth lay of enron was highly motivated it got him his employees and society what health insurance companies make their money denying coverage to those that pay them for coverage that is a real creative money maker bear sterns ceo walked away from a taxpayer bailed out fiasco the bank was a private for profit and it externalized its costs and debts to the taxpayer not all but too many companies are using the govt to subsidize the or bail them out when in trouble but reap in profit for themselves giving nothing back to the taxpayer govt society that they play pyramid games with to amass their wealth as the share holders and everyone else goes bankrupt the executive walk with millions or in some cases billions anyways mark makes a very good point on wealth creativity and incentive working class trade their labor for pay to an employer that exhanges employees a pay for that labor to make a profit from said labor basically are companies really making that much in profit off the wages of their ceos then as mark points out there is japan and how they deal with this to whom much is given much is expected says august 2nd 2008 at 9 44 am after accumulating so much wealth a point of diminishing returns ensues when that energy must be circulated or it becomes stagnant and morally infective august 4th 2008 at 9 50 pm robt the fed was never under the control of the government it was rushed in patriot act style during a christmas recess after a manufactured economic panic in 1913 the income tax was created at the same time to pay for all the interest we must pay these bankers for creating money out of nothing when did the government actually print its own money they printed the interest free colonial script in pre revolutionary times and a war resulted andrew jackson printed interest free money and was nearly assasinated lincoln printed his greenbacks to finance the civil war and was assasinated there was another president in the late 1800s forgot his name that stood on a stong monetary reform platform and was killed within 6 months of the inaguration then there was a senator who was pushing for similar reforms in the 30s and was poisoned finally kennedy started to print lincolns greenbacks and was assasinated do you see a pattern here there are some very powerfull forces out there that are determined to maintain the status quo banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money

7482957 they thought of it as something they really enjoy and like to do but now they do it in order to get money and they think of the task as an instrument to get money and not an activity that has value in its own right
7482958 human beings both want to and in a deeper way need to feel a sense of being autonomous when someone else begins to seduce you into behaving with an offer of a reward it takes away your sense of being autonomous now you are doing it for someone else

7482966 with speculation heating up that the city council will attempt to vote to extend term limits a 1961 buffalo court case is on its way to the center of the fight after years of scant mention the case in which the state court of appeals ruled that buffalos council could repeal a term limits law passed by referendum is again being talked about around city hall where it is cited as evidence that new yorks council has the authority to extend its term limits even though new yorkers twice voted in favor of a two term limit
7482967 while the buffalo council voted to amend a term limits law that had been approved by referendum decades earlier the new york city council would be attempting to override a decision made by city voters in 1993 and again in 1996
7482968 i think theres a big difference between a 35 year old referendum from an earlier generation and something that has been approved by the voters
7482969 if the mayor and the speaker engage in an unholy alliance to undo the peoples will i think there will be people throughout the city who will be angry about that
7482970 there would be a political backlash for people who went and did it

7483030 en espa a a n se est especulando sobre una base relativamente incierta acerca de las posibles causas de la cat strofe a rea de madrid a n as el accidente del vuelo jk5022 de spanair con sus m s de 150 muertos ha puesto este fin de semana el punto de mira sobre el hecho de que la seguridad de la aviaci n civil espa ola aparentemente no se encuentra en la mejor de las situaciones el pasado mes de mayo se public una encuesta de la universidad rey juan carlos que desvelaba datos preocupantes entre otros aspectos el 87 por ciento de los encuestados hab a respondido con un s ante la pregunta de si en espa a existen compa as a reas que no cumplen las normativas de seguridad lo realmente angustioso es que los encuestados fueron 613 pilotos en activo
7483031 no carece de cierta fatalidad que spanair se encontrase entre las compa as a reas que en aquel momento obtuvieron uno de los mejores resultados entre los problemas mencionados por los pilotos se encontraba la fuerte presi n a la que est n sometidos los comandantes de vuelo el 30 por ciento de los pilotos reconocieron haber dado en alguna ocasi n una cabezada manteniendo la palanca de mando
7483032 el accidente a reo no presenta indicios de fallo humano una nueva v ctima muere a causa de las heridas

7483034 hab a una serie de presagios para la cat strofe de spanair lo que conmociona especialmente a los alemanes es que el modelo volaba bajo un n mero de lufthansa
7483035 lo que causa especial conmoci n entre los familiares de las v ctimas en alemania es que gerd mrotzek el padre de la familia alemana fallecida en el siniestro hab a comprado los billetes para su mujer para sus hijos de cinco y ocho a os y para s mismo en la compa a lufthansa su vuelo llevaba el n mero lh2554 pero en realidad la familia se encontr entonces en un vuelo de spanair socio de la l nea a rea alemana el avi n operaba para todos los pasajeros no alemanes bajo el n mero de vuelo jk5022 en el sector a reo era bien conocido que spanair se encuentra en una crisis debido a penurias econ micas la empresa hab a panificado numerosos despidos la situaci n de plantilla habr a sido tan dram tica que los capitanes de spanair habr an asumido incluso tareas de mec nico seg n informa javier navas que representa a spanair en el sindicato de pilotos espa oles
7483036 sin embargo los miembros de la alianza star alliance est n obligados a cumplir los mismos requisitos de seguridad que lufthansa y a presentar cada dos a os una certificaci n de haber pasado los llamados controles iosa tambi n spanair hab a pasado este amplio control de seguridad el pasado a os bajo la supervisi n de aviation quiality services una filial 100 perteneciente a lufthansa

7483045 abundan las especulaciones sobre las causas del accidente de spanair en madrid las im genes tomadas por las c maras del aeropuerto parecen contradecir ahora las primeras informaciones que apuntaban a que el avi n lleg a desequilibrarse por el incendio declarado en uno de sus motores seg n abc las im genes hacen pensar que el avi n carec a de la potencia necesaria en el momento de proceder al despegue siendo sta una hip tesis corroborada por el testimonio de un piloto que presenci el accidente el mundo evoca otra teor a el tim n habr a resultado da ado por la explosi n del motor izquierdo por otra parte sigue creciendo la pol mica por las supuestas negligencias de la compa spanair que atraviesa graves problemas financieros

7483088 para alemania la pol tica acertada consistir a adem s de una cr tica clara contra el procedimiento en georgia en subrayar una y otra vez los intereses comunes de rusia y occidente aqu es donde hace falta la voz alemana pues es uno de los pocos pa ses que ha vivido la importancia que tiene una relaci n medianamente buena con rusia y lo nefasta que es una mala relaci n

7483134 why is your home learning adventure called st athanasius academy
7483135 todo a su favor tanto por resultado como por el n mero de jugadores
7483136 nos hemos llevado una derrota cuando en principio estaba todo favorable tanto por el resultado como por el n mero de jugadores pero el real madrid ha sabido apelar a la fuerza de su estadio se ha exigido m s con menos jugadores y nosotros no hemos sabido organizarnos para atacar con orden por lo que s lo nos queda felicitar al rival y aprender de cara al futuro
7483137 un palo para los jugadores y para todo el valencia
7483138 en el descanso quer amos mantener la misma l nea tener el bal n y buscar subidas por banda para mantener el resultado pero sali todo lo contrario hay que dar su m rito al rival que ha sabido tener esa fe igual que nosotros la tuvimos en la ida lo que tenemos que hacer es reaccionar para que no vuelva a suceder en el futuro
7483139 hay que quedarse con las sensaciones del equipo en la primera mitad
7483140 nos encontramos con una situaci n favorable en el campo pero esa fuerza para controlar no la tuvimos y en el segundo tiempo tuvimos una p jara importante y no supimos jugarle al real madrid
7483141 ahora hay que levantarnos con rapidez de esto hay que ser optimista crecer y nosotros lo vamos a hacer
7483142 esto le puede suceder a cualquier equipo pasa pocas veces pero hoy nos ha tocado a nosotros y es nuestra labor corregirlas y cicatrizar esta herida
7483143 la mentalidad de ir a por los partidos pase lo que pase
7483144 un equipo tiene que tener mentalidad y el a o pasado el real madrid ya demostr esa casta para ir por los partidos pasara lo que pasara hoy con estas expulsiones la reacci n volvi a ser positiva porque siguieron pensando en que se pod a ir por el partido
7483145 bonito emocionante y justo por la entrega que demostraron todos los jugadores sobre el campo
7483146 tanto como jugador como entrenador pero en el f tbol hay muchas sorpresas y yo s lo confiaba en que el valencia fuera de esos equipos que parecen tener problemas con un jugador m s porque para esto tambi n hay que tener cualidades y hoy el rival no las ha tenido
7483147 es una derrota dura dolorosa pero es un entrenador joven que acaba de empezar en este equipo que tambi n mostr otra cara por lo que hay que contar con ellos en esta temporada
7483148 es el mismo jugador que hace un a o tres meses o uno es un hombre importante para nosotros que deber a ser parte de este proyecto y triunfar en el real madrid es m s creo que l sabe que puede triunfar aqu de sobra porque condiciones no le faltan
7483149 tiene que ser ego sta y para este equipo creo que ser a muy bueno que se quedara

7483158 european affairs minister dick roche raised the prospect of a second lisbon treaty referendum last night saying he believes it is the appropriate response to the countrys continuing political crisis
7483159 the catholic primate of all ireland yesterday voiced fears that some christians had voted against the treaty because the eu was becoming ever more secular in its outlook
7483160 mr roche said if we want to retain our position as a constructive eu member state we cannot simply sit on our hands as some would have us do and keep saying that no means no
7483161 some members of government may be relieved that the unpalatable truth is now being aired
7483162 a government spokesman said last night mr roche is not calling for a second referendum to be put
7483163 the differing views from senior members of church and state will this week reopen the entire lisbon debate but may not bring closer the finding of a solution that would ensure our continued full membership of the eu
7483164 ireland has been given until october to tell our partner states what we intend to do to rectify the situation
7483165 we now need to take a hard look at our situation within the eu mr roche said we have to recognise however that all other member states 26 sovereign democratic parliaments are likely to have ratified the treaty by the end of the year this will leave ireland in an isolated position
7483166 the european affairs minister privately does not see any chance of resolving the problem by trying to put elements of lisbon into irish law by passing bills in the dail if the legislative route was not adopted the first time out it could not be resorted to now he believes

7483172 hay que arrimar el hombro no se trata de hacer oposici n oportunista y destructiva cuando el pa s necesita que su gobierno ponga en marcha un presupuesto como el que la situaci n econ mica reclama

7483175 que la posici n del gobierno catal n condiciona el juego pol tico del psc es una cosa comprensible pero el psc es el psoe tambi n y en el mismo grupo parlamentario la unidad es incuestionable
7483176 no tengo ninguna duda sobre el sentido del voto de todos los compa eros del grupo socialista incluidos los del psc

7483246 a real smart racer explained it to me this way after he wrecked me and i was really mad
7483247 he said i just had to look at your rear bumper and decide would you do this to me and you had before so it was a real simple decision
7483248 earlier this year we had a nationwide race and kyle was a lot faster than me and he went ahead and got to my back bumper of my car and sent me up the racetrack

7483289 die ank ndigung von ryanair ist nicht nur ein unmittelbarer angriff auf die passagiere und damit die kunden der fluglinie sondern umso rgerlicher als dass der zeitpunkt mitten in der haupturlaubszeit liegt und somit tausende reisende direkt betrifft
7483290 ryanair versucht mit dieser aktion in erster linie gegen alle kundeninteressen m glichst alle flugg ste ber die eigene website zu f hren damit diese dort zus tzliche reiseleistungen wie hotels mietwagen oder versicherungen erwerben

7483293 the reselling of tickets at inflated prices doesnt add anything to the cultural life of the country but instead leeches off it and denies access to those least able to afford tickets
7483294 event organisers have been telling me how important it is that tickets get to real fans i now want to see the industry find new ways of making sure that tickets get to the right people
7483295 but there are some sporting and cultural events of such significance to the nation that we may need to prevent people from selling tickets on at a profit we will work with the industry to find a way to achieve this on a voluntary basis

7483312 luczo dragon racing is excited to add another race to its 2008 season with symantec we believe the detroit grand prix at belle isle is one of the great stops on the indycar series schedule tomas loves the track and this will give us more road experience as we continue to prepare for what we hope will be a full season in 2009
7483313 i am really looking forward to belle isle it is a very technical and quick track i love wall to wall driving and this track rewards drivers who are aggressive and willing to take a few risks
7483314 this is great this is a beautiful day im pretty happy and i love this track i won here in 2005 in star mazda so now ive repeated in 2008 i had an awesome car team moore racing gave me a beautiful car i did the job i finished first but its just not me its the team my family my manager this is for all the people who supported me in chile
7483315 we had something for pablo donoso its just every time you go into a braking zone all the air is off the cars and with it being so hot today and a bunch of different rubber on the track we were just locking up tires we had a few moments out there i fell back to pablo donoso but overall it was a good race it was a big improvement from where we started at the open test when we were about 11th or 12th so well take a fifth and a second from a weekend in california
7483316 it was a good race unfortunately during the restart i was a little bit stuck behind pablo donoso it was so hard to pass but when someone made a mistake you could pass and we got another podium its fantastic im really thankful for my healthy choice sam schmidt crew they worked really hard this weekend i dont know what happened behind us but i hope we can still fight for the championship
7483317 it was just tough to pass out there we were running on a little bit less aero than everyone else it was helping us stay up but it was making it so every time i got close id kind of lose the front end and wash back off as you can see weve got guys that were running faster lap times than us yesterday that couldnt get by so thats kind of unfortunate we could have really stood to finish ahead of bia ana beatriz just for the points but were looking pretty good going into chicago weve had good runs on the big tracks so i think we should be looking pretty good
7483318 yesterday was a good race it was a good opportunity to pick out the numbers for the inverted start but i picked the wrong number i think the way they do that is not very good its good for all the drivers especially at this track because theres not much passing so its a very boring race it was good that richard antinucci raphael matos and myself did some fighting out there the car was good again but you cannot overtake here i just tried to be close to them and i knew that i could have the opportunity to pass them and it happened after that i had just one lap and i was catching them the race leaders like crazy i think i was almost the fastest lap so i thought we could win again today for sure
7483319 i feel great thats what we needed coming out of here the inversion of the second race made things very very difficult i was clearly faster than richard antinucci unfortunately he blocked me four or five times he didnt give me any room and thats what happened im very happy that i made the pass and continue leading the championship and well go into chicago competing for the championship
7483320 all of the opposition is very difficult this year to pass everyone was stationary and were all having control gaps there was a
7483321 lucasfilm has been hooked up with agr for a while and now were doing this and its been a great relationship the new movie is an animated feature that is sort of a precursor to a tv series that is coming out in the fall it gets a lot of notoriety for the team especially with the stars wars brand and indiana jones we already have more notoriety than we need if were going to give it to something we might as well give it to racing ive lived through the andretti legends and now marco is carrying that on
7483322 people kept telling me that the door to victory lane would finally open and today we broke through it the door was really stuck but what an incredible effort by team penske i cant thank them enough im really excited about today because the car was extremely fast for me it was really fun pushing and pushing every lap for the entire race thats what its all about and thats what made us win we didnt save any fuel we just kept going and going and it paid off in the end
7483323 we didnt plan it like that but with the traffic we changed the plans lap by lap and we pitted when we thought we were going to slow down we never let our guard down we just kept pushing and we came away with a win
7483324 the attitude of those guys is priceless everyone has been working so hard since last wednesday taking cars to charlotte and bringing cars back from charlotte converting cars from oval to road course youre talking about two days work in 12 hours when you see guys doing that you just want to do your best not that we dont always give our best but you want to make it a special day and today it was
7483325 the fraternity pulled together with us and helped us get back together all these guys they are all racers a great group of guys it is all about people and helio castroneves and ryan briscoe really did the job today we have tough competition out there helio wanted to get that win and wow what a way to do it under the adversity we had this week i want to thank everyone that called us and helped us over the last several days
7483326 once again it shows the determination that this group has it wasnt easy the way that yellow came out it was a bit of a mixed bag fortunately we were able to mix strategies and play it out from there we would not have won this race if helio hadnt driven the wheels off it when he needed to it is a testament to the organization we will keep going and see where we end up at the end of the year
7483327 i think our approach next weekend is the same we go for broke that is the only thing that is going to get us where we need to be
7483328 im not upset with anybody in particular we just did absolutely nothing right i dont know why we stayed out when the car in front of us is three seconds slower and we couldnt make up any track position everything we did was wrong
7483329 we still lost a ton of points this is a race thats very tough unfortunately we got the bad end of the stick hopefully well turn it around next time
7483330 when you lose 30 whatever today it makes it a lot easier to come back
7483331 it was definitely a bad day i guess we just need to shrug it off and come back strong next week
7483332 well those things happen and we have to go into the next couple races i think if helio castroneves wins the next two we just have to place fourth so we should be able to do that we just have to stay behind him were ok we have a long way to go yet
7483333 its unbelievable to start the week off the way we did with the fire and everything and then dominate with a one two qualifying and race result its definitely the strongest weve been all year im so happy for helio castroneves not getting a win all year and getting all of those seconds was killing him so im really happy for him to win the race he was the quickest car out there today its just great for the team big congrats to team penske
7483334 the only thing i could do was risk we were going for the win i have to say what a boring race there was no passing saving fuel from lap 1 i did not have any fun im not taking it for granted but maybe we have to look at the fuel windows so we dont have people pitting on lap 5 we race for the fans and although they are crazy here today it was kind of boring
7483335 they gave me a number above the one i needed to make it and i was making it i was controlling well and on the last lap they said go and i did
7483336 i give chip ganassi a lot of credit he came into the team meeting today and hes got a lot of guests here from target and we wanted to perform well scotts dixon obviously in the championship hunt and he gave us the order that we were going to do something very alternative and we did and it just kind of played out perfectly it was a great job from him and everybody the pit stops were really good it was just one of those races there was a pretty clear track most of the time so it worked out
7483337 we didnt think like that we said that we were going to commit to it and whatever happens happens we started in the back it is so difficult trying to pass tony kanaan was really slow at the end but he was quick enough in the right plac es so it was hard to pass that was a shame it was a good day for target chip ganassi racing its unfortunate for scott dixon he was quick all weekend thats the thing with these tracks its hard to overtake hes one of the best guys out there i think its the strategy that cost him but hell bounce back and he knows hes got a strong teammate in his corner to look after him
7483338 i am very proud of the motorola team today kyle moyer and my crew did a great job we started in the ninth position and to get a top five finish at a course that is very difficult to pass at is great we need to use this momentum going into belle isle next week and hopefully have a repeat finish
7483339 i think we did a great job the car was very competitive and michael cannon gave us great strategy today to lead the race and be up front the team i have to give them a ton of credit also the pit stops were fast and helped us maintain our position we have some room to improve and run against the bigger teams but today proved that we can compete with them
7483340 what a great day for us ive got to thank everybody on the delphi national guard pit stand because it was jb team owner john barnes david cripps and the guys that really made this happen for us they took a risk early and it paid off for us at the end of the race i took one shot at passing e j viso but i was losing rear brakes badly and the back was skating around on me it was a great points day for us too especially after starting 18th i think a few weeks ago we were in 16th position in the championship and now were in 11th weve still got two more races and more positions to make up
7483341 we had a good pit strategy and we had picked it from the very beginning we decided we wanted to go two stops and we saved as much fuel as we could we knew it wasnt going to be easy and we would have to save a lot more fuel than most did but at the end of the day it worked out for us the car was the best i have had it all weekend i was definitely pretty happy with it it certainly gave me something to race with
7483342 the mcdonalds team was running strong but once that yellow happened it really mixed everything up and we had to decide which strategy to go on helio was on our same strategy and he won the race but he was able to get by people a couple of guys between me and him werent able to overtake the backmarkers and it allowed the people on the other strategy to capitalize its disappointing because i thought the mcdonalds car was good and we had a strong day but we couldnt get a result out of it we did everything we could so we just have to move on to the next one

7483385 opening night will be a memorable and historic evening at the us open with the celebration of the open era

7483387 there is always a little buzz even in the middle of the points thats the main difference between this tournament and others its good for the crowd to get into its different to wimbledon which is very quiet here it is the opposite its much louder its good and its a different feeling to play i love coming here

7483410 door particulier onderwijs toe te staan en het publieke onderwijs te verwaarlozen gaan we naar steeds grotere tweedeling in het onderwijs
7483411 de scholen moeten genoeg geld krijgen om al deze zaken goed te regelen de komst van priv scholen geven de overheid de gelegenheid om achterover te leunen we gaan richting een situatie waarin de overheid matig onderwijs levert en wie beter wil gaat daar maar extra voor betalen je kunt toch de markt op
7483412 dit onderzoek moet ook komen omdat kabinetten waar zalm deel van uit maakte geen volledige openheid wilden geven over hoeveel geld er aan het koninklijk huis werd besteed daarmee is hij niet de aangewezen persoon om dit onderzoek uit te voeren
7483413 de inspectie kan wel oordelen dat de instelling zorgvuldig gehandeld heeft maar daarmee is het nog niet gewenst het beleid hoort ja tenzij te zijn iedereen wordt gereanimeerd tenzij men heeft aangegeven het niet te willen in overleg met de bewoner dan wel de familie moet besloten worden of iemand eventueel gereanimeerd wordt mensen collectief afschrijven vanwege hun leeftijd is wat de sp betreft geen optie

7483416 feitelijk tegen het duitse schoonmaakbedrijf menke dat heeft zeven maanden geleden het schoonmaakwerk in de huisjes van center parcs overgenomen sindsdien zijn er al zeven poetsvrouwen zo noemen ze de dames in deze streek ontslagen duitse schoonmakers krijgen minder dan nederlandse en er wordt geen ziekengeld of pensioenpremie mee betaald bovendien intimideert menke mensen die protesteren tegen de gang van zaken het bedrijf dreigt een vrouw 4500 euro boete op te leggen omdat ze geklaagd heeft over misstanden center parcs houdt zich doof voor de klachten en zegt dat het zijn zaken niet zijn het bedrijf wordt immers ingehuurd
7483417 helemaal niks er stonden bij de ingang van het park ruim honderd mensen met borden spandoeken en pamfletten om bezoekers de situatie van de schoonmakers duidelijk te maken de leiding van center parcs wat particuliere beveiligers en vier politieagenten keken van een afstand toe de demonstranten hadden een zaaltje in het park gehuurd om de baas van center parcs een gouden struisvogel te overhandigen omdat hij in hun ogen zijn kop in het zand steekt en de leiding van menke moest een gouden zweep krijgen vanwege de intimidatie toen we het park opliepen werd de directeur van het park zenuwachtig en probeerde hij de demonstraten tegen te houden waarbij hij de agenten om hulp vroeg die lieten de demonstranten echter begaan toen ze hoorden dat er gewoon een zaal was gereserveerd
7483418 gezien het verlies aan koopkracht in de afgelopen jaren de oplopende inflatie de stijgende winsten en de weigering van de top om de lonen te matigen zowel in de publieke als private sector is het volkomen terecht als de vakbonden een groter deel van de welvaart opeisen

7483457 for the same financial years there was no action plan to address the under spending by 24 municipalities which totalled r 87 7 million
7483458 high levels of inequality contribute to undermining self confidence and self respect

7483463 since most of the clauses directly affecting workers rights have been dealt with we will not declare a general strike
7483464 i dont think there is a psychological barrier to tennis
7483465 it is part of a three year strategy to broaden the base of community and school tennis
7483466 anybody from eight to 80 can play tennis it is safe social and a low impact sport
7483467 we want these parks to open up to be a place to hang out and to do homework like some places in america
7483468 overcoming the perception of tennis as a snotty game is an uphill struggle
7483469 they charged 1 for lessons between 10 12am but you cannot apply the disciplined 10am rule maybe down the road when they are into it but not at the beginning instead of enticing people from tougher backgrounds to start playing the middle classes from further afield rocked up in range rovers to take advantage of the scheme
7483470 the lta allows coaches with certain qualifications to teach but pe teachers would be fine so long as they can engage with big groups of people and be a bit of a performer
7483471 brad gilbert was allegedly paid about 800 000 by the lta to coach andy murray we should stop spending on the elite and spend on the rest of society
7483472 i did it just for fun because it was something to do after football i didnt know how to play
7483473 everyone has to sign up to be it the lta the education sector youth sports trust sport england local authorities and coaches without everyone doing so we will not succeed in broadening the base of the game and allowing talent to move up the pathway easily to the high performance level

7483476 but if they had a childrens day like they do in the roland garros french open that would help but in france the majority of the crowd are tennis players at wimbledon the spectators see wimbledon as part of their summer season

7483489 its been a physical twoa days and were out there banging
7483490 the good thing is the games going to be easy compared to these two adays were putting in 16 hour days here
7483491 i would say a lot has been asked out of us not only mentally but physically but weve been pushing through and every day trying to come out and not let the physical part affect us mentally just try and push on and push on and get through camp and get ready for this season
7483492 well practice on monday which normally wont be a practice day for us one of the reasons is to get the bad practice out of the way when you start class because there certainly is a different mindset different distractions that get you before you get back on the field
7483493 but i think we want to continue working hard and not let school really interfere school is on one side and football is on the other so youve really got to be able to balance that as a student athlete
7483494 but i think as a team we needed it we needed all the meetings we had we put long hours up here and every chance we get to learn from these coaches and learn what they expect the better off well be
7483495 thats just something weve got to get used to going to class and still performing out here on the field because i dont think coach petrino has any intention of changing how intense practice is going to be
7483496 thats just something weve got to adjust to and get right
7483497 the list of foreign policy failures this week is breathtaking
7483498 the end of the pax americana the era in which the united states more or less maintained a monopoly on the use of military force

7483504 were way way behind in our infrastructure investment both in the private sector and publicly

7483507 id like to thank you for the warm welcome ive received as the newest member of this campaign what you and barack have accomplished over the past 19 months is incredible and its an honor to be part of it
7483508 were in the seminal stages of this exceptional revolution in information technology how we disseminate it how we receive it around the world and were still working our way through it
7483509 when people look back at this campaign one of the headlines will definitely be that this was one of the first truly internet campaigns both for the press and the candidates
7483510 if you look at what senator obama has done fundraising organizing across the web this is something that weve never seen in the past and the coverage on the web has really driven much of the political conversation for the last year thats the first time its done that
7483511 whisper that the candidate had a girlfriend that lived out on the east side
7483512 the web has changed everything it may be even harder for the politicians just as its put new pressure on the press
7483513 the web is the only conveyor of news on a national and international scale that has no editor
7483514 we have to both learn to live in that universe and report in that universe but also take a step back from it because so much of the way news is made across the web tends to have a more partisan cast
7483515 part of our job is to still maintain a kind of national conversation where all sides can get heard sometimes it can get uncomfortable for us because we hear from each side when theyre not happy

7483524 the surrender of the suicide bomber indicates that the iraqis are continuing to reject al qaeda and its practices
7483525 after the georgian leadership lost their marbles as they say all the problems got worse and a military conflict erupted
7483526 and i believe we should handle other existing conflicts in this context
7483527 we have agreed to meet and discuss the transdniestria settlement
7483528 i think there is a good reason to do this today i see good prospects of reaching a settlement
7483529 thank god during all these years we had enough brains and reserve not to allow a similar deterioration of situation
7483530 frozen conflicts are a real volcano which can blow up anytime
7483531 that is why taking into account what had happened elsewhere it would be useful if we exercised again such wisdom not to allow such things to repeat in our country
7483532 in the process of trading up and down dramatically last week it has become clear that only one factor really matters right now
7483533 big money investors have turned oil into a proxy for the u s dollar
7483534 we continue to see little chance for oil to be used by russia as a bargaining tool
7483535 oil is the weapon of last resort not of first resort and it would make no sense for russia to limit exports of crude or products to european countries
7483536 this law is specifically for legislators in the national assembly and senate

7483540 die glanzlose kugel bewegte sich im u eren bereich leicht indem sie kreiste oder sich nach links und rechts hin und her bewegte doch im inneren der kugel sah man mit aller klarheit und ohne unterbrechung st rkste bewegungen

7483543 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
7483544 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain

7483577 kansas city is honored to be a stage one host during this premier sporting event
7483578 the tour has already proven itself as a major economic driver to kansas city bringing in more than 5 6 million in tourism spending to the area last year we look forward to welcoming visitors to all the fun events that surround tour of missouri in kansas city
7483579 this is the first facelift its had in twenty four years it was due
7483580 avoid letting your political enthusiasm turn you into a verbal bully
7483581 beware of your actions in the face of others discontent too much jubilance too much emphasis on victory may cost you a friend
7483582 choose to discuss subjects that are safe and unlikely to create tension
7483583 that will smooth the transition back into a friends life
7483584 we need to ensure that we learn the lessons of those two events and that we continue to strengthen an integrated process to defend ourselves against these kinds of intrusion
7483585 its critical to our mission that we are comfortable that we have a secure network that its resilient to probes and attacks and that it will be able to sustain good decision making for the nations leaders
7483586 all of those have to come together in a unified effort if we are to maintain adequate defense against those who might intrude to our networks and try to disrupt them its a big challenge
7483587 if you are going to be successful at defending it you have to have strong and close integration among the various agencies
7483588 because this is such a broad area and it touches so many different elements of our society business medical care information certainly military and economic many of those same organizations are struggling with how do you pull them together in a more coherent fashion
7483589 im not as worried that a cold war relationship is returning so much
7483590 those are things we have to pay attention to but i think it is important not to swing the pendulum too much in an alarmist fashion
7483591 i dont see a threat to the nation coming from the arctic
7483592 but i do see security concerns that will arise as you have nations compete for resources as you have nations compete for passage as you have commercial interests competing for passage through the area all of those have a security element and i think we just have to have a good discussion about it
7483593 if we believed we have solved the problem we are almost guaranteeing it will come back you cant take your eye off the ball in this kind of a situation
7483594 we are seeing a team now that is closer knit than maybe ever before
7483595 those days are gone we are working hand in hand
7483596 we are seeing now a synergy that is really strong
7483597 on any given day one of them will be our highest priority
7483598 what keeps me awake is making sure that our team is focused on the many threats out there and not taking any one for granted not leaving any one unobserved

7483602 the historical account is the story of the novel and the fiction is the emotion the motivation the explanation for the historical facts my tudor books are specifically set in a place and a time and that is accurate to the historical record when that is available
7483603 however speaking out against the death penalty was easy as an intellectual argument but far removed from the harsh truth of real cases which speak to the emotions rather than the intellect
7483604 accordingly i am unable to say at this stage when proposals will be available

7483606 ireland owes a lot to europe and to the eu
7483607 its difficult to believe that ireland would enjoy the peace in the north or the economic progress in the south that we have today without the support of the european union
7483608 are becoming uneasy about what is described as the loss of christian values and memory in europe
7483609 despite the fact that so many european citizens have religious faith and convictions
7483610 we need a europe that doesnt confine its debates to politics and history but also takes into account social values social cohesion and the place of the family
7483611 i am asking that these matters be reflected upon especially in light of recent events
7483612 more difficult for committed christians to maintain their instinctive support for europe
7483613 there is no doubt about that it is there in peoples minds and hearts
7483614 we are headed into a time when a confluence of changes are going to lead to a perfect storm making us finally realize that our health care system needs a major overhaul
7483615 as the elderly population doubles between now and about 2030 projections are that we will see at least a doubling of the costs of the federal and state health and retirement programs
7483616 that will likely be when the perfect storm hits but if we miss it then we will likely have missed all the storm clouds for the foreseeable future
7483617 while attention focuses on these two major trends other storm clouds are brewing
7483618 a long term care crisis looms grows and receives little attention despite problems with the affordability quality and access to long term care these problems will only become much worse as the aging population doubles by 2030
7483619 much attention also has been paid to the problems of financing social security but the financial problems of the social security program pale in comparison to the burden of the medicare and medicaid programs on our economy
7483620 there are already shortages of nurses and open nursing positions are sometimes filled by the expensive practice of recruiting migrant nurses into communities
7483621 added to this problem now are reports of shortages of other health professionals including therapists social workers health aides and even some categories of physicians
7483622 overall we continue to worry about the general quality of health care as well as the problems of health disparities as the inequities of our economy and culture flow into the health care system

7483628 it is looking unlikely that we will be able to operate for the rest of the evening
7483629 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

7483634 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7483635 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7483636 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7483637 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7483638 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7483639 we thought the downside was limited the possibilities were reasonable and the amount of fun was limitless
7483640 if there wasnt a curve in it you could see both city limits signs
7483641 the proverbial light bulb went off i thought that might be fun to play with that name a little bit
7483642 i thought lets step out on a limb here and name the bank tightwad
7483643 to be really frank the customer base in reading kansas was not too excited
7483644 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7483645 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7483646 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7483647 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7483648 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7483649 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7483650 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7483651 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7483652 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7483653 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7483654 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7483655 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7483656 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7483657 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

7483661 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7483662 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7483663 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7483664 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7483665 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7483666 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7483667 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7483668 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7483669 as soon as i take 1 or 2 or 3 more bounces on the trampoline make 1 or 2 or 3 more sand sculptures in the sandbox take one more turn on the swing argue with siblings that i never got my turn on the trampoline or swing or whatever they have to take turns with and then when you ask if they put their toys away they will innocently say
7483670 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7483671 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7483672 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7483673 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7483674 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7483675 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7483676 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7483677 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7483678 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7483679 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7483680 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7483681 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7483682 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7483683 who are open to doing something on the production side
7483684 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7483685 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7483686 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7483687 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7483688 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7483689 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7483690 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7483691 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7483692 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7483693 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7483694 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7483695 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7483696 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7483697 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7483698 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7483699 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7483700 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7483701 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7483702 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7483703 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7483704 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7483705 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7483706 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7483707 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7483708 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7483709 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7483710 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7483711 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7483712 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7483713 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7483714 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7483715 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

7483724 we are not ruling out the merger but havent finalized anything
7483725 the company is analyzing many options to break even by december end at any cost as aviation is our core business and we are in the industry to do business

7483727 thats like leaving the tap running and pouring 40 trillion litres of water into the garbage can enough water to meet the household needs of 500 million people
7483728 i was very surprised with the high numbers but it catches everybodys attention
7483729 so there is a distribution problem but this also reflects the maldistribution of water

7483785 it was the first time i was in a race car since i retired in 2003 and it was the first time i was on a road course since 2001
7483786 while it took me a little while to get comfortable i can honestly say today that it feels like i was never out of the cockpit im not as polished as i was but im getting there
7483787 we are a new team and this will be just our fifth race a part of me says i cant strap myself into a car without thinking that i can win but i have to be realistic we need a year or two of competition before we can really expect to challenge some of these guys
7483788 actually difficult is probably a better word to describe how i feel about not being able to compete being the homeboy and all but it is what it is
7483789 when you are playing well you feel comfortable on all courts
7483790 in the past when i was playing well i did well on hard courts too i feel good for sure i won two tournaments in toronto and the olympics and i played semifinals in cincinnati
7483791 i think i need the crowd support a little bit this year
7483792 i still believe its an advantage if you know how to win a u s open its a tough tournament to win
7483793 i had a tough year and ive been struggling quite a lot
7483794 its tough to expect results but i will try my best
7483795 somehow i started to go out there and started to believe im a player and i can compete with the top players

7483818 i had even chided arcot veeraswamy for his remarks against the left and had instructed my partymen not to speak against the left this clearly shows that the dmk has not taken any anti left stand
7483819 i am sorry to say that even karunanidhi has chosen to speak in a certain language to show that he doesnt want us probably he has made up his mind we also dont want to be part of this alliance
7483820 i would have to become a communist if i had not met social reformer e v ramaswamy and c n annadurai as i am in total agreement with the policies of that party i have high regard for all left leaders in the country
7483821 i have brought to the notice of the leaders at delhi and in tamil nadu
7483822 it is the right of political parties to have an alliance with other parties but as far as the dmk is concerned it never severed ties with its alliance partners particularly with the left who has identical policies like ours

7483838 people think that if they take a medication their body absorbs it and it disappears but of course thats not the case
7483839 based on what we now know i would say we find theres little or no risk from pharmaceuticals in the environment to human health
7483840 theres no doubt about it pharmaceuticals are being detected in the environment and there is genuine concern that these compounds in the small concentrations that theyre at could be causing impacts to human health or to aquatic organisms
7483841 it brings a question to peoples minds that if the fish were affected might there be a potential problem for humans
7483842 it could be that the fish are just exquisitely sensitive because of their physiology or something we havent gotten far enough along
7483843 i think its a shame that so much money is going into monitoring to figure out if these things are out there and so little is being spent on human health
7483844 they need to just accept that these things are everywhere every chemical and pharmaceutical could be there its time for the epa to step up to the plate and make a statement about the need to study effects both human and environmental
7483845 we realize that we have a limited amount of data on the concentrations
7483846 were going to be able to learn a lot more
7483847 these are chemicals that are designed to have very specific effects at very low concentrations thats what pharmaceuticals do so when they get out to the environment it should not be a shock to people that they have effects
7483848 we know we are being exposed to other peoples drugs through our drinking water and that cant be good

7483857 unfortunately once again we have suffered with a reliability problem this time on kimis car which lost us precious points
7483858 now we have to find out what happened in yet another engine failure and then decide how to react
7483859 clearly what happened is serious and we will have to do all in our power to make up for the ground we have lost through reliability problems in the coming races
7483860 now we must continue to push to the maximum to develop the car and improve reliability in order to be as well prepared as possible for the forthcoming races
7483861 we still have two test sessions at monza and then jerez and a lot of hard days work in the factory
7483862 unfortunately yet again we were not reliable both from a technical point of view and in how we operated on the track given what happened during raikkonens pit stop and then the failure of his engine
7483863 we have a great potential from both the team and the car capable of putting us in front of everyone else but if not all elements are operating at their optimum then we are throwing away precious points that could cost us dear
7483864 we must work to remedy these problems and thats what we will do starting in the days that follow
7483865 in the last race i also started on the second row but i finished much further behind
7483866 i believe everyone is trying their best but we have to be realistic and i think the true pace of our car is more similar to todays pace than yesterdays in qualifying
7483867 we struggled a bit more than ferrari and mclaren on the long stints
7483868 most probably with new tyres i managed to pull something more the car is behaving better but as soon as the tyres get a bit used then the car starts sliding too much and you cannot do anything
7483869 i still finished half a minute behind hamilton so its quite a big gap to the front
7483870 i think the key point of this weekend was just qualifying managing to put my car in third position second row
7483871 it turned out today that we have even more fuel than the top two cars so it was quite a good achievement later in qualifying managing quite good laps and i think it was the key point

7483994 every time i see obama he mentions something about how that was such a big day for him
7483995 he mentions the tremendous group of victories in maryland d c and virginia he will not forget us
7483996 i think the decisiveness of his victory was a big part in creating the conventional wisdom that we wouldnt be able to catch up with him
7483997 the clinton campaign probably thought feb 5 was going to be the knockout blow and then one week later to have such a clear group of states going obamas way really helped

7484043 the prototype tests up to this point have consistently shown failure
7484044 that doesnt give us a whole lot of comfort when theres a potential of thousands or millions of these devices operating without any protection to ensure that our broadcasters are able to get clear picture to our viewers

7484070 if one wants to recognize effortlessly the essense of politics let one reflect upon the fact that it was a hitler who was able to make the world hold its breath for many years the fact that hitler was a political genius unmasks the nature of politics in general as no other fact can
7484071 political language is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind
7484072 politics is the art of looking for trouble finding it misdiagnosing it and then misapplying the wrong remedies
7484073 there are no political solutions only technological ones the rest is propaganda

7484307 espero que em breve israel liberte mais milhares de prisioneiros
7484308 um ato de fraqueza que vai incentivar ainda mais o terrorismo
7484309 esse discurso contra libertar prisioneiros com as m os manchadas de sangue um absurdo

7484325 escrts are like the recycling units of the cell they oversee the constant intake break down and replenishing of junctions on the cell surface
7484326 in a cancer cell where escrts are damaged the junctions may not be restored properly this can cause cells to separate and migrate to form secondary tumours in other parts of the body
7484327 previous studies have shown a link between escrts and the loss of junctions in cells of fruit flies so we want to see whether this is also true in humans
7484328 this work should tell us more about the role of escrts in cancer and provide possible new targets for therapy in the future
7484329 sooner or later we need to have the laws in place to protect the indian surrogate mothers and also the foreigners who come here for treatment
7484330 to further the cause of requisite laws for it surrogacy we organised the national moot court
7484331 the aim of organising a national moot court competition was to improve the oral advocacy skills of students and to give them a platform to showcase their training for proper and successful acting in court as also for displaying their intellectual flexibility
7484332 we intend to expand our distribution reach to 13 500 villages out of the 15 000 in the state

7484335 ttp has been declared as a terrorist organization and the interior ministry has issued a notification to ban it

7484337 china secured its position as a world power with the olympic games in beijing
7484338 most olympic games so far have been staged in the developed countries but china has shown it can do it as well if not not better
7484339 beijing was the best olympic host of the past century
7484340 first class facilities first class organization that is what is being said about the games in beijing
7484341 but it was also noticeable that china did not do as well when it comes to human rights press freedom and democratization
7484342 the carefully orchestrated facade could not conceal a police state that tramples on human rights
7484343 beijing got what it wanted out of this globally televised spectacular it reaped a huge prestige bonanza that it will surely use to promote its international influence and we fear further tighten its grip at home

7484361 life is an echo it gives back what you have given
7484362 if they think a patient will gain an extra year of life but it will cost more than 20 000 they think it is not cost effective yet if the patient wants to pay for it themselves they are denied nhs treatment its an outrage
7484363 the nhs was built on the foundation of caring for the community it was designed to help those who needed help care for those who needed care and treat those who needed treatment
7484364 those basic principles have been lost as the government takes us down a dangerous path that can only be a catastrophic meltdown of the system
7484365 ten years ago waits of 18 months were not uncommon but by the end of this year no one should wait longer than 18 weeks none of this would have been possible without the hard work and dedication of everyone working into he nhs
7484366 we cant make torchwood toys we cant market to children because its an adult show maybe we could do torchwood sex toys i will suggest it
7484367 burden the original decision of the woman and the physician
7484368 would essentially bar abortions because the equal protection clause does not allow somebody to kill a child and if this is a child then this would be an anti abortion statute
7484369 as i understand it this puts the burden on the attending physician who has determined since they were performing this procedure that in fact this is a nonviable fetus that if that fetus or child however way you want to describe it is now outside the mothers womb and the doctor continues to think that its nonviable but theres lets say movement or some indication that in fact theyre not just coming out limp and dead that in fact they would then have to call a second physician to monitor and check off and make sure that this is not a live child that could be saved
7484370 if this is a child then this would be an antiabortion statute
7484371 obama is a father of two young girls you can bet that attacks like that will get him or any father riled up that language seems to be way over the top his critics can paint him as a pro choice liberal thats fair but to go any further is really beyond the pale is obama really sinister a monster
7484372 the world would be a poorer place without doctor who
7484373 that bore in the pub who delivers the punchline of a joke a second before it is delivered
7484374 for doctor who to turn into an old man youd be pissed off
7484375 even william hartnell had trouble back then he was often ill and he forgot his lines i think the doctor will always be about 40
7484376 i really love wales so its great to have the chance to play at a big festival here instead of taking the motorway we took the road up through the brecon beacons i feel at home here
7484377 bryn has asked me to be involved for a few years but because of filming ive never been able to
7484378 a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show
7484379 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic
7484380 we have provided daleks and components for the tardis in the past and i think a one off move to the screen would be amazing
7484381 it would take dr who to the next level so should be very successful
7484382 i think david tenant is an excellent doctor who is perfect for the part because he is eccentric and a nice guy too
7484383 i still believe its an advantage if you know how to win a u s open
7484384 i think he definitely didnt have his best day against me but playing him nine times i guess hes bound to have one off day out of all of them because there are times when i felt like there was nothing i could do
7484385 the goal is still the same and the pressure is still the same
7484386 the goal is to continue to improve my tennis and to continue playing a very good tournament
7484387 rafa will now feel what i had to feel for a very long time
7484388 so it will be interesting to see how he handles it but so far hes been great and hes played so well on all surfaces now maybe its nice to go into a grand slam for a change not having no 1 next to me and it should be interesting
7484389 i think its tough to play perfect for five years in a row
7484390 i think one big result and its turned around for him i know pretty much every player except for one that would take his bad year so i think you have to use a little bit of perspective hes created a monster for himself
7484391 i like doctor who being scary other kids shows are just funny but doctor who its all about fear death and screaming children
7484392 could donna come back well in science fiction anything is possible
7484393 i knew that there would definitely be an end to donna at the end of the series
7484394 but had that not been the case had it been open ended had there been potential for donna to stay for another series i must confess that id have said yes like a shot
7484395 could donna come back well in science fiction anything is possible

7484413 earlier the casualty ward received between 100 to 150 patients only today the number has increased to 800 the challenge is greater but resources insufficient
7484414 i had always been passionate about giving something back to my society which is why i chose to do medicine when i joined as a medical officer in 1989 and witnessed the poor condition of state run hospitals i decided to work towards a change i wanted to uplift the ward i was given charge of and prove that the government sector can also deliver if provided with the funds and opportunity this i was able to do over the years
7484415 the emergency ward at the jpmc karachi is possibly the only ward in the country where doctors are constantly busy if there is no political clash or bomb blast we are dealing with deaths from epidemics rain and what not
7484416 there were about 250 injured brought to the hospital and the chaos was unimaginable
7484417 in an urban city like karachi where suicide bombings clashes and political killings are common it is difficult to remain stress free but with time we learnt to handle one difficult situation after another
7484418 my official timings are from 8 00 am to 2 00 pm but i never return home on time and am unable to have lunch with my children it would always take me another three hours to wrap up

7484471 de stad is de plaats waar de samenleving op een informele manier met zichzelf experimenteert een stadse filosofie moet er dus op uit zijn om de diversiteit te behouden dat is een paradoxale onderneming want eigenlijk probeer je op die manier te bewaren wat per definitie veranderlijk is er zit niets anders op dan de regeldrift van de bestuurders aan banden te leggen en het initiatief terug te geven aan de burgers
7484472 of course what kind of question is that who isnt
7484473 it is clear this issue is very important locally the matters need to be aired in an open and transparent manner however we do not feel there is sufficient new information to warrant a full inquiry
7484474 we are brought together today by the tragic event of 16 august 2008 an event that claimed the life of a blue spader our brother in arms staff sgt kristopher rodgers
7484475 when a tragedy of this magnitude occurs taking from us such a special individual we are left with feeling the sorrow anger and sometimes guilt in order to find peace we come together and share memories we laugh cry and remember the unique qualities that made staff sgt rodgers a patriot and a guardian of freedom
7484476 staff sgt rodgers watched the events of sept 11 2001 unfold and instead of letting others secure his freedom and the freedoms of our great nation he picked up his weapon and made a difference
7484477 what i remember most about staff sgt rodgers is his professionalism loyalty to his men and his good natured demeanor
7484478 regardless of the situation staff sgt rodgers always maintained a positive attitude
7484479 it wasnt always easy for him in recon platoon but he would always listen and take advice from others in order to make his own sops
7484480 he always took care of soldiers and held them responsible for their actions his standards were high but were not unobtainable he expected everyone in his recon team to meet or surpass them
7484481 in addition to being a professional soldier staff sgt rodgers was a good friend loving husband and dedicated father

7484483 alaskas election security apparatus showed the system to be in good shape
7484484 the university of alaska anchorage released a report that valuated the states election system in detail and recommended ways to strengthen the technology and election procedures
7484485 seals that would reveal tampering should be used on all voting equipment election security information should be added to poll workers training manuals there should be increased vigilance about security procedures at absentee polling places and state owned voting machines should be used in the north slope borough rather than borrowing borough owned machines
7484486 that tamper evident seals have been placed on all equipment
7484487 alaska voters can now go to the polls and cast their ballots knowing that their votes are secure
7484488 better the devil you know than the devil you dont know

7484490 this site was assessed at a very early stage and found to be very suitable past experience has shown that once built residents come to accept the turbines
7484491 the city deserves better than to have to welcome visitors coming along the a500 with a 290ft monstrosity
7484492 we have got to start to embrace this new technology from what i have heard i believe this is the proper place for this wind turbine
7484493 i think it is going to be an icon and people are going to come here and see that this is a progressive city that embraces modern technology and is forward looking
7484494 if we refuse this it will send our city back to the ark

7484500 is it possible for us to witness a world without america and zionism
7484501 barack obamas father was muslim and therefore according to islamic law so is the candidate in spite of the quranic verses explaining that there is no compulsion in religion a muslim child takes the religion of his or her father for muslims around the world non american muslims at any rate they can only ever see barack hussein obama as a muslim
7484502 he has to be good for arabs because he is a muslim
7484503 he cant be a christian his middle name is hussein
7484504 dont really understand obamas family tree but what they do know is that if america despite being attacked by muslim militants on 9 11 were to elect as its president some guy with the middle name hussein it would mark a sea change in america muslim world relations
7484505 exploit his background to argue that an apostate is leading the global war on terror to galvanize sympathizers into action
7484506 if i had known it the wind farm would look like this
7484507 i would never have put in all the work i have done on my place
7484508 it should be postponed for two years so landowners near it can sell their properties
7484509 or a smokestack i would love to look out the window and see nothing but nature but thats unrealistic i still want to turn on the light switch too
7484510 first wind had a job to do to sell this project
7484511 they dont lie but they dont tell the whole truth consider everything you hear very carefully
7484512 my worries are that small towns have no one to help them to understand these projects as a whole
7484513 they dont know what to expect they cannot fathom these things
7484514 with reference to the public inquiry into the proposed windfarm at drone hill near coldingham it has been discovered that the documents for public inspection were mistakenly lodged at duns public library rather than at eyemouth public library as agreed at the pre inquiry procedure meeting and stated in the note of that meeting
7484515 in order to comply with the relevant inquiry rules the inquiry has been adjourned and the documents are now to be lodged at eyemouth public library for public inspection for a period of at least 28 days
7484516 whilst it appears to have been a simple error it has resulted in considerable delay and inconvenience
7484517 nevertheless once this mistake had been identified there was no option but to delay the inquiry as we wanted to ensure that all members of the community have access to the relevant information
7484518 this is very important in terms of fairness to everyone
7484519 it is unavoidable that there will be increased costs for pm renewables and indeed for all the parties concerned
7484520 for our own part there will be considerable cost associated with our teams aborted costs and in regrouping again for the inquiry which still has some time to run in terms of the hearing session
7484521 in terms of this mistake impacting upon the outcome of the case we are confident that this project remains an excellent prospect and it will be for the reporter to decide on the matter once all the relevant facts have been heard
7484522 supporting documents relating to this enquiry were deposited in duns library rather than eyemouth library which had been the location agreed at a pre enquiry meeting
7484523 it is unclear at this stage how the mistake happened but we will be looking into this
7484524 we have received no correspondence from anyone who was looking for that information and was unable to locate it however in order to provide people with the best opportunity to assess this information the inquiry has been adjourned for five weeks
7484525 this episode highlights the burden that these inquiries are putting on local authorities such as scottish borders council
7484526 i understand that it costs the council more than 20 000 each time an applicant appeals against a decision and this is money that could be otherwise spent on front line services that the council provides
7484527 i believe that large industrial scale wind farms should not be forced upon local communities but instead we should be looking at small scale community based wind energy initiatives
7484528 in the case of this particular application there have been too many concerns relating to the scale and location of the project and i know that local campaigners have been very active in making the views of the local community known
7484529 the postponement is frustrating to all but at the same time we still believe we have a strong case
7484530 we are still supportive of the council who we felt made the correct decision in turning down the application last year
7484531 simple moor of large scale capable of absorbing substantial change
7484532 wind farms can be graceful objects in the right locations
7484533 i also admire the angel of the north in its location but put 22 angel of the norths on coldingham moor and i wouldnt
7484534 there is no landscape that can acccomodate this scale of development we have to stop pretending that landscapes can absorb wind farms
7484535 just because it is closed for half of the year does not diminish its case as a sensitive visual receptor
7484536 however with auto makers getting near the end of one model year and getting ready to start the next sales are beginning to show some signs of improving over julys dismal sales performance

7484544 the surveillance system picked up a problem that was occurring and allowed us to respond efficiently and effectively to an emerging public health issue
7484545 this is an example of where our surveillance system worked
7484546 we felt given the new information we had to take the most conservative approach possible and recalled 100 per cent of the production from the entire facility
7484547 we have an unwavering commitment to keeping our food safe with the standards that go well beyond regulatory requirements

7484554 nachdem man uns diese aufgabe erteilt hatte entschieden wir dass es aufgrund der zeitknappheit dem umfang und der komplexit t des schulungsprogramms am effektivsten sei uns bei der ausbildung der freiwilligen helfer auf diejenigen sprachlichen und anderen kenntnisse zu konzentrieren die sie mit hoher wahrscheinlichkeit w hrend der olympischen und paralympischen spiele ben tigen w rden
7484555 wir setzen unterschiedliche schulungsmethoden und inhalte ein je nach den aufgaben und standorten der freiwilligen w hrend der olympischen spiele f r helfer im bereich erste hilfe haben wir uns zum beispiel auf rollenspiele konzentriert und die schulungsgruppen mit 4 bis 10 teilnehmern so klein wie m glich gehalten
7484556 im mai habe ich am sprachtrainingsprogramm f r studenten teilgenommen
7484557 ich war schon sechs mal bei den olympischen spielen mit dabei und ich muss sagen dass die olympischen spiele in peking wesentlich besser verlaufen sind als ich erwartet hatte alle freiwilligen sind sehr zuvorkommend und haben mir immer weiterhelfen k nnen die meisten sprechen fliessend englisch ich hatte nicht erwartet dass sie so gute sprachkenntnisse haben w rden oder dass sie sich derart professionell um die besucher k mmern w rden

7484559 the psi supported nigerias homegrown policies that were first articulated in the nigerian economic empowerment and development strategy needs
7484560 after the expiry of the first two year policy support instrument psi in october 2007 the nigerian authorities indicated that they were considering a successor programme supported by the imf
7484561 i want to seize this opportunity of the commissioning of this all important road by dr emmanuel uduaghan to announce to you niger deltans that in the next few weeks president yaradua a lover of the niger delta will reveal a package of development projects designed for the niger delta and which will make everybody happy
7484562 the president may look slow to you but he has to be systematic in looking for solution to the age long problem of the niger delta
7484563 the fact that president yaradua has given the nddc the go ahead to flag off phase two of the road which covers tuomo tamigbe in burutu local government area shows that the president is committed to the development of the area
7484564 you all went to the field it was indeed peaceful materials arrived on time at polling booths and you can see that results have been declared
7484565 on behalf of my family the entire campaign team the deputy governor elect i thank all our supporters the electorate and those that came out to express their mandate
7484566 plot to eliminate the mujahid and destabilise the niger delta
7484567 after series of harassment which culminated in the physical detention of alhaji dokubo asaris family whilst he was busy hosting an economic conference in honour of isaac adaka boro meant to help bring investments into the niger delta we are forced to the conclusion that the government of the day is bent on destabilizing the niger delta region through a plan to either eliminate mujahid dokubo asari or smear his image here and abroad
7484568 the invading team had all the arms of the security organisations represented and they were armed to the teeth the government has not come out to state any tangible reasons for the raid all those who spoke denied knowledge and thats the issue
7484569 when nothing incriminating was found after laying siege for close to ten hours they pounced on mujahids foreign partners who were assisting in putting together an automobile school mechanic workshop and deported them
7484570 after series of harassment which culminated in the physical detention of alhaji dokubo asaris family during the last raid on his house whilst he was busy hosting an economic conference in honour of isaac adaka boro we are forced to conclude that the government of the day is bent on destabilizing the niger delta region through a plan to either eliminate mujahid dokubo asari or smear his image here and abroad
7484571 i strongly believe that the lives of our people should no longer be used for playing politics in whatever guise of being part of the struggle
7484572 as the president of ijaw youth council worldwide i can say unequivocally perhaps this training the nddc is undertaking in collaboration with the iyc and the foundation for ethnic harmony in nigeria is the first major breakthrough for our struggle to find its feet again
7484573 to put the records straight i may not be a staff of the nddc or fehn and i am not in any of their exclusive list but i do have full knowledge of the kingian modules of studies having been a certified non violence practioner since 2006 the benefits can not be over emphasized
7484574 the program itself is a full package with a triple barrel and was borne out of the desire to rid the region of youths who are not committed to change
7484575 nnpc has carefully reviewed the issues canvassed by nlng on the implication of the proposed amendment and our views are that the tax holiday granted is time bound and is due to expire by 2009 or earlier if it can be established that the lng cumulative average sales price has reached 3 mmbtu

7484578 fosta mea sotie este din romania si am venit aici in 1991 am realizat ca nu erau locuri in care se poate bea in bucuresti asa ca am decis sa am un pub al meu am investit foarte putin in primul pub the dubliner am cheltuit in jur de 20 000 de dolari in 1994
7484579 am facut o intelegere cu proprietarul care a construit pub ul iar eu ma ocup de conducerea business ului investitiile nu acopera si proprietatile respective am incercat sa le cumpar dar proprietarii nu au acceptat
7484580 investitiile trec de 150 000 de euro excluzand achizitia spatiului
7484581 bucataria este o investitie importanta vorbim de aproape 40 000 de euro pentru o aparatura moderna restul sunt decoratiuni si mobila majoritatea locale doar afisele de pe pereti sunt din irlanda
7484582 acum doi ani as fi spus ca un irish pub este o investitie excelenta lucrurile s au schimbat mult de atunci daca vrei sa inchiriezi acum este foarte scump acum caut spatiu pentru o alta locatie si mi s a oferit o chirie la 13 000 15 000 de euro lunar in lipscani au vrut 30 000 de euro lunar pentru o locatie de 100 de metri patrati cumpararea locatiei e o optiune mult mai buna acum
7484583 va trebui sa creez un volum mare de afaceri si voi deschide noi locatii intentionez sa mai deschid doua pub uri in bucuresti si in alte orase din tara voi construi baruri si le voi inchiria celor dispusi sa conduca o astfel de afacere e un fel de francizare noi dam spatiul iar francizatii nu vor taxe ci doar chiria respectiva
7484584 va fi o corectie in urmatorii ani preturile vor scadea pe masura ce vor aparea si mai multe spatii de inchiriat sau cumparat
7484585 primul lucru pe care il observi intr un pub irlandez este galagia toata lumea vorbeste similaritatile exista in special la the harp este chiar un exemplu bun de irish pub romanii iubesc conceptul in fiecare seara pub urile sunt pline
7484586 din acest an avem un al treilea pub mollys deci incasarile vor creste anul trecut am avut o cifra de afaceri de 1 3 milioane de euro si ne asteptam la o crestere de 20 in acest an
7484587 in medie pentru un eveniment rugby world cup incasarile pot creste cu 25 30
7484588 un client cheltuie in jur de 35 lei nivel mai scazut decat in pub urile din irlanda dar in crestere
7484589 marja de profit pentru puburi ajunge la 18 e mai mare decat profiturile pub uilor irlandeze cheltuieli cu salariile sunt mai mici in romania decat in irlanda
7484590 dimineata la 9 ajung de obicei in the dubliner la birou la pranz vizitez the harp pentru pauza de masa apoi revin seara la the dubliner si imi petrec si o jumatate de ora la mollys in fiecare zi
7484591 he goes out tomorrow and ill see what he looks like in a couple of months
7484592 hes only in his first preparation and hes had four jumpouts and six races thats enough for now id rather turn him out now while he still thinks racing is fun and not flattened
7484593 hes so laid back and nothing seems to worry him
7484594 he may get away with a dead track especially when he steps up over a middle distance but i wouldnt run him on top of the ground because of his jarry action
7484595 perhaps next year as he matures he might get away with it but i think theyd run him off his feet on a firm track
7484596 he needs 2000m now but hes just not strong enough at this stage hes a late foal and not four until december hes still a baby really
7484597 i always new he was going to kick once i got him out wide and gave him a couple of taps he lengthened stride
7484598 hes a helluva good horse what is he going to be like next year

7484613 m glicherweise glaubt die russische f hrung augenblicklich sie sei machtpolitisch so stark dass es auf die beziehungen zur eu oder zu deutschland nicht ankommt eine weile kann das gut gehen aber es m ssen doch nur die rohstoffpreise deutlich fallen und russland bek me mit einem solchen kurs erhebliche wirtschaftliche innenpolitische und soziale probleme

7484924 as an example of the team atmosphere he said to me im very sorry im very sorry and it was not his fault it just shows how ferrari people are the passion that they have the way they behave and the professionalism that they put in every day we need to be very proud of the guys who work in this team
7484925 the system works in the following way when the fuel nozzle is connected to the car you see that there is a red light on at a certain moment you see that there is a flashing light that is close to the red light telling the driver that he has to be ready then as soon as the nozzle comes off the light becomes green unless the guy that is controlling the pit stop position overrides it manually because there is a car in the fast lane coming through so he has to delay the car that is how the system works weve used it since last year
7484926 i dont think so to be honest when there is a red flight its a red light its like the lollypop is down i dont think that we need to go towards that depth of course we need to make sure that the system is always working that is something that we have to make sure but this is another story
7484927 we are doing pit stop practice at home trying to do more simulation or some rehearsals at home but the fact that we cant do it at a race i dont think is a problem
7484928 weve received a fine for the team and not for the driver to be honest we didnt consider that as an unsafe move as you could see there was no obstruction there was no braking felipe was on the right hand side he stopped and the force india let him through but that was the view of the fia and we have to respect it
7484929 unfortunately like the last time in hungary for felipe there was no indication at all we saw the smoke on the main straight once again and we are now disassembling the engine to understand what is the real problem so i cannot give you an answer straight away as to what the problem was because the guys are still working on the engine but there was no warning at all

7484938 i certainly would that is for sure i would love to be in newfoundland and especially being able to be home more often i do think it is great for newfoundland to have this deal happen
7484939 as everyone knows out here in the oil field workers make darn good money it would be a lot to ask a man trying to make a living to go to work for wages that is a lot lower
7484940 we have great facilities here were in a port if we need to move things in and out were in the right location hopefully we can use some of that to our benefit

7484956 the stakes of this election will be made very clear
7484957 back in june and july i truly thought he was going to blow mccain out of the water and carry 30 or 40 states
7484958 what has happened is that republicans mccain specifically have really twisted his great charisma this electric personality to discredit his ability his experience his capacity his judgment i fear they are about to do to him what they did to gore
7484959 obama has got to do some things that will shore up his ability to lead not just to charm but to lead theyve got to give credibility to his understanding of foreign policy his ability to deal with tough people and tough questions and his ability to be more explicit and convincing on his health care policies and energy policies

7484963 viscerally my feeling is theyve got to come back at him hard and theyve got to do more to complete the task of definition both definition of him as well as definition of john mccain
7484964 he has still got to get to the meat and potato blue collar workers this is a big opportunity for him
7484965 if hes up to it in the 11th hour and can get the green light from doctors he might be able to pull it off

7485117 this new credit line provides gengsheng with additional financial flexibility
7485118 we improved our cash flow to generate more working capital and future sales in the first half of this year and this new credit line is another step towards expanding our ability to deliver a wider range of high growth and high margin products in the industrial material space
7485119 its not easy for israel to release prisoners some of the individuals being released today are guilty of direct involvement in the murder of innocent civilians
7485120 but we understand the importance of the prisoner issue for palestinian society we believe this action can support the negotiation process and create goodwill
7485121 we had lost hope that my brother would be released because hes been in prison for 32 years
7485122 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will be part of the georgian state
7485123 everything you say is looked at and in many cases misconstrued
7485124 theres a reason why people like her its because she doesnt sort of you know fuel the fire
7485125 i wake up every morning wondering how on the earth im going to pull off that next minor miracle to get through the day
7485126 with the exception of the campaign trail and life in the public eye i have to say that my life now is really not that much different from many of yours
7485127 patterns in our life and in our work often develop and repeat in a regular manner and then something unexpected happens something shifts slightly and the pattern and rhythm become radically new it is in those moments of unexpected change that great possibility exists we shift we transform we go off the grid aesthetically conceptually or environmentally in this conference we will concentrate on how we can seek those points of departure and together go off the grid
7485128 no tenemos planes de construir una segunda planta de smart
7485129 in the past two weeks we had largely secured the zone but you have to be frank we were guilty of overconfidence
7485130 i am sure that the military strategy which has been indispensable initially will not be enough
7485131 i remember having a conversation with a friend several years ago about how when a tv show starts losing its ratings they will almost always bring in a celebrity to try and revive it
7485132 i think someone at microsoft marketing must be from the tv industry
7485133 somehow i doubt that was the kind of comparison microsoft was hoping to make
7485134 what could be more appropriate than using professional comedians as vista pitchmen
7485135 i wish theyd use judy tenuta now that would be ads that bite
7485136 and they blew it and then they blew the second impression too
7485137 i cant imagine what they think seinfeld can do to help my customers wont go near vista at this point and i doubt anything other than a new os release would fix that
7485138 if thats what they are planning it will backfire big time i can see random insults moving things from the average person hating vista to the average person hating microsoft no one likes being told theyre an idiot
7485139 the perfect spokesman for windows built on technology developed before the internet well known but not very relevant and even though you really cant avoid windows nobody is fanatical about it
7485140 that really has a synergy with seinfeld you can turn on any broadcast channel in any city in america and be sure theyre playing episodes of seinfeld but nobody is actually a regular viewer of those episodes
7485141 as much as seinfeld was great during its heyday watching it today very clearly dates it and exposes that its not as timeless as theyd like you to believe
7485142 i fear that by drawing on this star of the 90s microsoft may be showing its longing to return to a time when buying a computer meant buying windows
7485143 short of every linux distro calling home which i hope will never happen there may never be a way to know how many linux users there are
7485144 perhaps the downloads of some cross platform application would give a rough idea but that application would have to be something that a linux user a mac user and a windows user would want equally if anyone has a better idea i would love to hear it
7485145 although its difficult to tell how many people are using linux microsoft must have a very good idea of how many people are not using vista
7485146 its a bit though not entirely like trying to calculate the market value of food from a home kitchen compared to that of restaurant meals
7485147 measurement of prices paid is not the only difficult task
7485148 you also have to consider the cost of sampling dont like ubuntu try fedora quickly and free opportunity costs for the software itself a low price now even for what is perceived as lower quality goods in some contexts means money available for other things and freedom to experiment and recombine perhaps windows makes sense for some people in a given organization but the data entry might taste just as good if done on linux based thin terminals
7485149 makes less sense as a concept when the market is as fluid as the free software world
7485150 machines dual boot are repurposed are used as vm hosts or serve apps to dozens of other machines which may or may not be running the same os in the first place and not just for free software sure you can count certificate or license sales for various versions of windows but does anyone even pretend that represents the total number of windows installs
7485151 the best metric to measure the success or failure of an open source project is the number of users moved enough to contribute their vision to the project which enables more people to benefit
7485152 that number not the number of users will measure how much momentum any push for change will get
7485153 it has occurred to me that flash on linux is the one major entry barrier controlling acceptance of linux as a viable desktop operating system
7485154 no matter how stably smoothly efficiently and correctly linux runs on a machine the public will continue to view it as second rate if flash keeps crashing i really do have to suspect adobes motivation for keeping flash on linux in such a deplorable state
7485155 once everybody is using it they dont put any effort into making it work better thats not to say that open source software is always better but at least with open source the more popular your software is the more effort is being put into improving it
7485156 it crashes a lot on windows and linux its annoying on windows and linux the only question i have is why do people still care about flash
7485157 silverlights only chance for survival is adobe screwing flash up and boy do they seem to be going out of their way to do that
7485158 we feel that the forced conversion of these notes is a very positive step for both the note holders and the company we will add 558 000 to our equity following the conversion at the same time without expending any cash to retire the notes we will add an equivalent amount to our working capital by eliminating this current maturity and will reduce our future interest expense the former holders of the notes will benefit significantly since the shares they will receive are worth more than twice what they paid for them and are in a stronger company due to the improvement that will be reflected in our balance sheet and financial ratios

7485165 the united states is one of the most internet reliant countries in the world everything from banking to media to government materials are housed online
7485166 although the source of the attacks on georgia cant be confirmed it is evident that we have entered an age where any individual or organization including governments can easily organize and execute cyberwarfare campaigns at the forefront of this threat is the issue of web application security which has become the weakest link against hackers
7485167 we are now using rocket stream to accelerate our media delivery between abtv in thailand and our partner company asia broadcasting international inc in the usa

7485170 weve been gratified to be able to assist them in their mission of providing global television content to the thai population in a timely and reliable fashion by supplying abtv with the powerful rocketstream data transfer acceleration solution

7485247 i think we make a mistake when we fail to acknowledge the power of faith in the lives of the american people and so avoid joining a serious debate about how to reconcile faith with our modern pluralistic democracy
7485248 to truly be successful this initiative must utilize the unique resources and identity of the faith community while at the same time recognizing the indispensable role that government and public policy must play in tackling the root causes of poverty

7485306 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time
7485307 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits
7485308 do i think its a mans world in television that is the most ridiculous question i have been asked all week
7485309 the worst thing you can be in this industry is a middle class white male
7485310 if any middle class white male i come across says he wants to enter television i say give up all hope theyve no chance
7485311 is this evidence of some male conspiracy keeping women down
7485312 he lists five women because he couldnt possibly name all the men in positions of power in tv because he would be there all bloody day
7485313 thats what youre up against its that sort of assumption
7485314 he talks about middle class white men being a beleaguered species on television well excuse me but jonathan ross jeremy on newsnight

7485333 there are safety and security issues in just about every country in the world that we play with the exception of new zealand
7485334 professional risk assessment says the risk is acceptable in some of those places unfortunately at the moment its not acceptable in pakistan
7485335 what were all desperately hoping now is the situation in pakistan settle down and allows us to go back there next year we havent had a senior australian team in pakistan for a long time
7485336 we really hope the situation in pakistan improves to the extent where they can tour
7485337 i do not believe that despite this negative result i am now out of the running for the title

7485400 if everything morales says is true was she sexually harassed
7485401 no because the harasser did not clearly state that reason for his harassment was her transsexuality
7485402 that is the reason why nabil was a key player for us at the weekend i was saying to him stay wide stay wide and he offered the wide areas
7485403 andrea dossena was going forward in the first half and alvaro arbeloa in the second half but really our wingers are not players who play on the lines we have to try through our full backs and keep the other team back
7485404 we had a lot of offensive players on the pitch but if you had said to me we would draw then maybe i would have said yes because we had conceded late
7485405 it is always difficult to score two goals in that length of time
7485406 it is impossible to play well all the time so you need to keep going you have to give credit to middlesbrough they were pretty good and well organised
7485407 they had good players in front and could play good football they had players in the wide areas who were good they worked really hard in defence
7485408 but if you play badly and win it shows you have the mentality to be contenders and to win trophies that is a very positive thing
7485409 i believe we should fund it and take action that will assist detroit and its suppliers in making it through this difficult time of transition
7485410 its a common sense response to the realities on the ground
7485411 government policy can be aligned with consumer demand and the efforts of the industry
7485412 congress created a program for direct loans and were hopeful that they can fund those this year
7485413 he says his life was in danger but wont reveal those who wanted to kill him what is more urgent to reveal a person who intends to kill you or to expose corruption

7485430 after the georgian leadership lost their marbles as they say all the problems got worse and a military conflict erupted
7485431 and i believe we should handle other existing conflicts in this context
7485432 we have agreed to meet and discuss the transdniestria settlement
7485433 i think there is a good reason to do this today i see good prospects of reaching a settlement
7485434 thank god during all these years we had enough brains and reserve not to allow a similar deterioration of situation
7485435 frozen conflicts are a real volcano which can blow up anytime
7485436 that is why taking into account what had happened elsewhere it would be useful if we exercised again such wisdom not to allow such things to repeat in our country
7485437 the zone is very exposed to serac ice block falls there is no question of risking the life of rescuers to recover bodies were not in an emergency situation any more
7485438 it looks like it will drag on for some considerable time further yet
7485439 weve got our fingers crossed that things will improve but there is the recognition that there is still a long way to go yet
7485440 bill komt al maandenlang continu met nieuwe song ideetjes naar mij toe
7485441 elke vrije minuut gebruiken ze om nieuwe liedjes te schrijver
7485442 wederom nemen we het album in het duits en in het engels op
7485443 op dat album zullen ook een aantal duitse nummers staan
7485444 waarschijnlijk gaan ze weer naar een of ander klein eilandje
7485445 i still believe its an advantage if you know how to win a u s open
7485446 i think he definitely didnt have his best day against me but playing him nine times i guess hes bound to have one off day out of all of them because there are times when i felt like there was nothing i could do
7485447 the goal is still the same and the pressure is still the same
7485448 the goal is to continue to improve my tennis and to continue playing a very good tournament
7485449 rafa will now feel what i had to feel for a very long time
7485450 so it will be interesting to see how he handles it but so far hes been great and hes played so well on all surfaces now maybe its nice to go into a grand slam for a change not having no 1 next to me and it should be interesting
7485451 i think its tough to play perfect for five years in a row
7485452 i think one big result and its turned around for him i know pretty much every player except for one that would take his bad year so i think you have to use a little bit of perspective hes created a monster for himself
7485453 thats the plan but i dont think either one of us is aiming for two
7485454 non c nessuno pi puerile del cinico perch il cinico crede ancora con tutte le sue forze che il mondo abbia un senso e non riesce a rinunciare alle sciocchezze dellinfanzia tanto che assume latteggiamento opposto
7485455 do i think its a mans world in television that is the most ridiculous question i have been asked all week
7485456 the worst thing you can be in this industry is a middle class white male
7485457 if any middle class white male i come across says he wants to enter television i say give up all hope theyve no chance
7485458 is this evidence of some male conspiracy keeping women down
7485459 he lists five women because he couldnt possibly name all the men in positions of power in tv because he would be there all bloody day
7485460 thats what youre up against its that sort of assumption
7485461 he talks about middle class white men being a beleaguered species on television well excuse me but jonathan ross jeremy on newsnight
7485462 look at the today programme have i got news for you newsnight
7485463 they are very much judged to be the people imbued with a sort of gravitas that women are still struggling to achieve
7485464 i dont think there is a psychological barrier to tennis
7485465 it is part of a three year strategy to broaden the base of community and school tennis
7485466 anybody from eight to 80 can play tennis it is safe social and a low impact sport
7485467 we want these parks to open up to be a place to hang out and to do homework like some places in america
7485468 overcoming the perception of tennis as a snotty game is an uphill struggle
7485469 they charged 1 for lessons between 10 12am but you cannot apply the disciplined 10am rule maybe down the road when they are into it but not at the beginning instead of enticing people from tougher backgrounds to start playing the middle classes from further afield rocked up in range rovers to take advantage of the scheme
7485470 the lta allows coaches with certain qualifications to teach but pe teachers would be fine so long as they can engage with big groups of people and be a bit of a performer
7485471 brad gilbert was allegedly paid about 800 000 by the lta to coach andy murray we should stop spending on the elite and spend on the rest of society
7485472 i did it just for fun because it was something to do after football i didnt know how to play
7485473 everyone has to sign up to be it the lta the education sector youth sports trust sport england local authorities and coaches without everyone doing so we will not succeed in broadening the base of the game and allowing talent to move up the pathway easily to the high performance level
7485474 years ago hardly anyone sang then simon cowell did pop idol
7485475 it is very successful and it would take an awful lot to change
7485476 but if they had a childrens day like they do in the roland garros french open that would help but in france the majority of the crowd are tennis players at wimbledon the spectators see wimbledon as part of their summer season

7485480 the rehabilitation of pri should not extend to the consequential grant of any concession area to pri in whatever form of tenurial instruments from its expired timber license agreement tla no 43 pulp and timber license agreement ptla no 47 and integrated forest management agreement ifma no 35
7485481 pri will be assured of sustainable of wood and other forest products to feed its mills and plants even without timberland concessions there are similar sawmills veneer plywood and paper factories in cities gainfully operating without timber concession areas
7485482 the development protection and utilization of forest products for the sustained wood supply to pri will be less expensive to the company as the people themselves side by side with the lgus and the denr can be harnessed in developing and protecting the timberland while a big segment of the population will have the opportunity of earning livelihood without necessarily being employed by the company

7485491 ulteo application system is a gnu linux distribution based on kubuntu and designed to work with the ulteo online desktop service to provide you with an automatic offsite backup and file synchronization between live cd instances
7485492 as the debian gnu linux project marks 15 years of existence how much has it diverged from the intentions with which it set sail as times 4 linux distros which look like mac os x
7485493 heres an interesting compilation of linux distribution which resemble apples mac os 10
7485494 despite all its advances gnu linux remains weak in its support for proprietary audio and video codecs because these codecs are often musix 1 0 r2r5 released
7485495 2008 is the first year when production has reached the level prior to that of saddam hussein s fall
7485496 the increase in the generation of electricity has been achieved by repairing some old plants and installing some new ones
7485497 distribution is now much improved as sabotage has been eliminated to a very high extent because the security situation is much better this has affected our network now most of the network is in operation
7485498 there are still some lines which were sabotaged two or three years ago and now we are trying to rebuild them
7485499 the capacity of iraqi power stations is actually far higher but plants are so outdated and in bad shape that they frequently shut slashing generation to less than half of the 13 000 mw of nominal capacity
7485500 we may face a very serious problem if we do not put in place new power generation
7485501 the need for energy will be much more we have millions of iraqis out if these people return to iraq this means that new projects would be needed this is a pressing need

7485509 china was eager to present something that shows it is a new power that has its own might
7485510 it has problems but it is able to manage them it has weaknesses in its institutions but also strengths in those same institutions
7485511 the world has learned about china and china has learned about the world
7485512 i believe this is something that will have positive effects for the long term
7485513 they have earned a tremendous amount of face because of the olympics
7485514 they are going to ride on that for a while we dont have a culture that is pro change china by nature has got to be provoked to make changes the economic reforms came about because we were desperately poor
7485515 for the chinese authorities to sentence them at all shows the governments insecurity and intolerance of even the most peaceful challenges to its authoritarian control
7485516 i would hope that we would look back at this as a major threshold of when china ditched all its baggage of the historical narrative of aggrieved nationalism
7485517 and just rewrote that narrative and began to act with more confidence about itself and its role in the world
7485518 i think that would make china and chinese become more tolerant and open
7485519 beijing will return to being well cloudy full of smog
7485520 with its increase of wealth china is entering a stage where it needs to have better transparency good governance and more accountability
7485521 this olympics is a good start for us to think about how china is strong and where we are weak
7485522 this alerts individuals to the possibility that they may be at risk of identity theft and may assist them to prevent the theft of their personal information

7485528 we have set ourselves a target for this month out of five games we would like ten points if we do that each month like we did last year we will be in a very good position i feel good with start we have made but we have got to keep our feet on the ground

7485531 it has been a great success especially as there have been no major casualties
7485532 the global attention has been fantastic television ratings around the world at record levels and the athletes made history
7485533 but longer term we are looking at growing our position in china which is our fourth largest market and this means increasing brand awareness
7485534 i would definitely say the beijing games were a success for sponsors as there is a tremendous amount of recognition around the companies involved
7485535 we have a very clear target for our presence at the beijing olympics and we want to see a 10 percent improvement for brand enhancement in china
7485536 so far from interim reports and our sales figures the beijing olympics has been a great success

7485564 distribution is now much improved as sabotage has been eliminated to a very high extent because the security situation is much better this has affected our network now most of the network is in operation
7485565 there are still some lines which were sabotaged two or three years ago and now we are trying to rebuild them power stations is actually far higher but plants are so outdated and in bad shape that they frequently shut slashing generation to less than half of the 13 000 mw of nominal capacity
7485566 we may face a very serious problem if we do not put in place

7485571 this was chinas last gold medal of the beijing 2008 olympic games but perhaps the most important one because after seven years of intense preparations bocog and china has offered to the world 16 days of exciting olympic sports competitions supported by smooth operations a success which has permitted the athletes to achieve their best in optimal conditions
7485572 my colleagues and i are extremely honoured to be awarded the olympic order
7485573 its not only a honour for the entire team of bocog but also a recognition of the hard work that the chinese people have done to host a successful games
7485574 the best place to be a mother in the world
7485575 we are very pleased that the index confirms the core values of a small democratic society which has never had a military and has effectively practised peace for hundreds of years

7485582 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 percent to 44 percent advantage last month

7485601 hes even criticized senator obama so its a tribute to senator obama that hes not just choosing a yes man but a person who will speak what he believes

7485610 to get long term release we think these multi component systems are the way to go
7485611 we can control the release by combining the materials in different ways and were confident that we can extend the release time further even to 90 days
7485612 our previous studies showed that soft landing can be used to prepare ultrapure peptide layers on substrates the question we faced was in addition to controlling purity can we also control the structure of the molecules we showed we could
7485613 because we were starting from something that wasnt a helical in solution we were a little pessimistic whether it would work at all
7485614 we found an interesting pathway to conduct different types of chemical reactions between complex molecules and substrates that will potentially enable us to prepare materials that cannot be made by standard methods
7485615 we hope to conduct lots of chemistry on the thin films

7485619 for centuries people appreciated only the beautiful works of art and long life of the colours but little did they realise that these works of art are also in modern language photocatalytic air purifier with nanostructured gold catalyst
7485620 these vocs create that new smell as they are slowly released from walls and furniture but they along with methanol and carbon monoxide are not good for your health even in small amounts
7485621 gold when in very small particles becomes very active under sunlight
7485622 the electromagnetic field of the sunlight can couple with the oscillations of the electrons in the gold particles and creates a resonance
7485623 the magnetic field on the surface of the gold nanoparticles can be enhanced by up to hundred times which breaks apart the pollutant molecules in the air
7485624 this technology is solar powered and is very energy efficient because only the particles of gold heat up
7485625 in conventional chemical reactions you heat up everything which is a waste of energy
7485626 for all of these nifty applications to work someones got to sit down and do the dirty work of understanding the surface
7485627 people have dreamed up all of these cool applications for nanorods but one of the biggest bottlenecks to making this a reality is this interface
7485628 dna chips have revolutionised biological and medical science for many years scientists have tried to develop similar protein chips but technical difficulties associated with attaching large numbers of proteins to surfaces have prevented their widespread application
7485629 the method we have developed could have profound applications in the diagnosis of disease screening of new drugs and in the detection of bacteria pollutants toxins and other molecules
7485630 the longer a serious disease goes undiagnosed the harder it is to treat and the further it can spread
7485631 this new test will eliminate a lot of the guesswork
7485632 being able to get such quick results for so many pathogens at once will become critical in case of bioterrorism
7485633 under that scenario every minute counts in providing treatment or preventing disease spread
7485634 electrical energy storage is very important for all electrical and electronic systems
7485635 even renewable energy systems like solar cells need somewhere to store excess energy to be used at night
7485636 traditional materials are ceramic materials which have high weight and are very fragile
7485637 matching the permittivity and uniformly dispersing the ceramic nanoparticles is not easy
7485638 both problems have to be tackled and solved at the same time for the material to have the desired characteristics

7485664 big money investors have turned oil into a proxy for the u s dollar
7485665 we cant underestimate the relief among consumers to see gasoline prices come down but there is concern that this could be temporary
7485666 households still have to deal with a weak labor market deteriorating real income falling wealth and obviously the drop in home prices
7485667 any permanent upturn consumer confidence will be bouncing around at these low levels and thats not good for the economy

7485671 it was thanks to him that the fire did not spread any further

7485699 to keep things as flexible as possible the book was going to require translation thereby allowing us to write things that we could then contradict later on if we didnt like it we could simply say it was a bad translation first time around
7485700 we think we can prevent a problem that could have as much impact as the s amp l crisis
7485701 i think it was a game where our defending helped us to get our rewards i said at half time that we needed to be more composed and not to give the ball away too cheaply
7485702 i said before the game that aldershot would give us our toughest game of the season so far and i think they definitely did whether they keep that momentum over the season remains to be seen
7485703 im delighted with the three points as its not always going to be pretty but we had to dig in and work hard to get the result we know that we are going to create chances and with our forwards we know we are going to score and we got our rewards
7485704 it was a great header from grant holt their keeper has made some great saves today but with that header he could only watch the ball go in thats because we persevered and wanted to win the game we got behind them and we got crosses in and in the end we got our reward the goal was probably against the run on play in every game you play the opposition will have a spell where they put you under pressure and today that spell lasted longer than i would have liked in the second half
7485705 they looked a threat there are plenty of goals in them this season
7485706 this year our front two have been working very hard on their movement they will cause teams problems and the start of our season has been fantastic
7485707 i believe we did more than enough in the second half to deserve a draw
7485708 but there is a distinct lack of confidence here at the moment and when youve got fear its like a handbrake and when you doubt yourself it manifests itself as an indifferent performance at half time i told them to let the handbrake off and we had a glimmer of hope
7485709 we immediately put chester on the back foot by scoring early which gave us a huge lift i was particularly pleased to see that it came from a set piece
7485710 we arent looking at the table at the moment we will just take each game as it comes we have made a good start and are happy with the way things are progressing but there is a long way to go
7485711 this is a sensitive and difficult case but you need to know that we are engaged at every level on this
7485712 we are committed to obtaining maximum value of our assets and to doing what is right for all of our constituents

7485724 obviously the referees do bottle it because they keep making the same mistakes all the time

7485726 there wasnt a lot in the game at that point and wed had chances but they seem to get luck like that all the time
7485727 it was definitely not the weekend i was hoping for
7485728 but i do not believe despite this negative result i am now out of the running for the title there are still six races to go and 60 points up for grabs
7485729 we have seen that the situation can change really quickly even if i realise things are now more complicated

7485760 the advertising programme is part of the nsw governments 1 3 million cannabis mis information campaign it will also include cinema advertising and posters at bus stops as well as being displayed in magazines such as dolly girlfriend and x box magazine the questions remain though 1 will they do the cinema advertisement like they did with the last apartheid campaign by putting a highly discriminatory anti cannabis ad in the middle of two buzzword legal highly attractive drug ads one for ethanol and one for caffeine and just to be more discriminatory they followed it up with an anti smoking ad all displayed in an m15 movie that regularly pushes r18 drugs as for posters at bus stops why dont they just show what they really mean by sticking an anti cannabis poster side by side with a massive double up
7485761 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7485762 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7485763 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7485764 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7485765 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7485766 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7485767 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7485768 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7485769 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7485770 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7485771 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7485772 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7485773 on a scale of one to ten how bad does it hurt
7485774 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7485775 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7485776 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7485777 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7485778 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7485779 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7485780 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7485781 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7485782 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7485783 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7485784 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7485785 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7485786 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7485787 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7485788 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7485789 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7485790 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans

7485797 es necesareo que toda la gente conocca este tipo de bombillas poner mas
7485798 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7485799 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7485800 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7485801 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7485802 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7485803 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7485804 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7485805 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7485806 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7485807 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7485808 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7485809 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7485810 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7485811 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7485812 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7485813 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7485814 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7485815 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7485816 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7485817 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7485818 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7485819 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7485820 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

7485828 the first thing that happened was that the russian tanks came in
7485829 from our point of view the georgian military was only responding to a russian invasion
7485830 we need cash but in the long run we need some kind of insurance for the companies coming here
7485831 we were the fastest growing non oil economy in the world
7485832 the last thing georgia needed was this kind of military confrontation
7485833 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7485834 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7485835 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7485836 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7485837 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7485838 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7485839 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7485840 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

7485849 wir d rfen nicht warten was 2011 ist sondern wir m ssen jetzt und heute etwas unternehmen um die konjunktur anzukurbeln und die kaufkraft zu st rken
7485850 die vp hat den sessel vor die t r gestellt und neuwahlen ausgerufen und die vp ist mit uns seither nicht bereit bei der teuerung mehr taten zu setzen als bei den punkten pflegegeld und familienbeihilfe wir haben uns engagiert bem ht und wir sind in erster linie der bev lkerung verantwortlich
7485851 ich halte es nicht f r m glich dass die vp als reaktion auf ma nahmen der sp f r die bev lkerung sagt da schie en wir irgendeinen minister ab da muss ich ganz ehrlich sagen das w rde ich der vp zum heutigen zeitpunkt nicht unterstellen
7485852 mir gef llt nicht dass man in so einer diskussion die fakten so beiseite schiebt eine fl chendeckende lkw maut bedeutet f r viele betriebe die weiter weg von der autobahn liegen eine zus tzliche belastung
7485853 teile des gr nen verkehrskonzepts sind realistisch f r die setze ich mich ein aber ich werde auch rede und antwort zu jenen punkten stehen die ich f r absolut unrealistisch halte eine fl chendeckende lkw maut muss von den sozialpartnern so vorgeschlagen werden dass sie die kleinen betriebe nicht zerst rt das ist mir ein wesentliches anliegen

7485857 everyone was polite and seemed interested but no one offered to raise money to build her
7485858 were getting all the interested parties together around the table to see what we can do
7485859 we did a similar thing in copenhagen a couple of years ago for the cable itself and that proved to be quite productive bt have leased capacity but theyre not actually using it and theres capacity that could be used by other telecoms companies as well so were basically looking to sit around the table find out what everybody has got once they start speaking together thats when things start to happen

7485866 zuerst wird eine wahre hexenjagd gestartet und direktor koperna von kabeg vorstand professor mandl mit der begr ndung er habe jedes vertrauen zu diesem verloren vor die t r gesetzt und dann wird der gleiche direktor koperna von mandl als dessen rechte hand ins kabeg management gehievt
7485867 zum einen muss professor mandl dessen gef hrlichen zick zack kurs niemand mehr folgen kann als kabeg vorstand schnellstens abgel st werden au erdem muss aufsichtsratsvorsitzender martin strutz der keine gelegenheit ausl sst zu betonen dass er nicht verantwortlich ist farbe bekennen entweder er nimmt endlich seine verantwortung wahr oder er gibt seine position als aufsichtsratsvorsitzender auf

7485870 sie sollte sich daher auch diesmal nicht vom apparatschik denken der sp burgenland beeindrucken lassen das einzig und allein auf kosten einer region ihrer bewohner und ihrer kinder geht
7485871 fairness und gerechtigkeit haben bei ihnen keinen platz ich hoffe dass ministerin schmied trotz wahlkampfes anders denkt und damit die rechtswidrige verz gerungstaktik des burgenl ndischen landesschulrats aufhebt
7485872 alles andere als eine rechtzeitige positive entscheidung w rde auch das gesamte konfessionelle schulsystem in sterreich in frage stellen wenn man schon nicht von niessl und landesschulratspr sident resch verlangen kann dass sie sich dieser tragweite bewusst sind so ist sich hoffentlich die ministerin im klaren dar ber dass damit ungeahnte folgewirkungen verbunden sein k nnten

7485876 j rg haider ist f r visionen bekannt und hat schon in der vergangenheit damit immer recht gehabt
7485877 die n chste bundsregierung wird sich gleich mit einem volksbegehren gegen die teuerung zu besch ftigen haben
7485878 davon profitieren besonders pensionisten und gruppen die armutsgef hrdet sind
7485879 jede ma nahme die den menschen im kampf gegen die teuerung hilft wird vom bz unterst tzt
7485880 recent further price increases in raw materials have been larger than tmcs cost reduction efforts are able to offset

7485882 die zus tzlichen containerklassen und wanderklassen f r dieses schuljahr w ren vermeidbar gewesen
7485883 katastrophale unterrichtsumst nde sind die folge es handelt sich hierbei um eines der gr ten bel in der wiener schulgeschichte
7485884 ein teil der kinder muss in kellerr umlichkeiten unterrichtet werden ein anderer sitzt in aular umlichkeiten auf flexibler bestuhlung und ein weiterer in containern
7485885 in wien sitzen auch dieses schuljahr wieder in mehr als 2 3 der ahs klassen mehr als 25 sch ler innen das ist nicht akzeptabel
7485886 von schmieds versprechen merken die wiener sch ler innen und lehrer innen nichts au er das es sich um hei e luft im sommer handeln muss
7485887 da lachen ja die h hner wenn jetzt die vp und ihre mehrfach regierungssprengmeister molterer und sch ssel pl tzlich als hort der politischen sicherheit gelten sollen
7485888 und nicht zu vergessen herr khol hat all diese grauslichkeiten damals mitbeschlossen
7485889 die menschen brauchen jetzt dringend entlastungsma nahmen die sp will die halbierung der mehrwertsteuer auf grundnahrungsmittel will die steuersenkung bereits ab 1 1 2009 will den mietzinsstopp und die vp sieht tatenlos zu wie ganz sterreich unter der teuerung st hnt
7485890 einmal mehr ist bewiesen dass die sp auf der seite der bev lkerung steht und die vp eine abgehobene unsoziale politik betreibt
7485891 es ist offensichtlich dass die vp sich f r den tag nach der wahl absichert der schwarze wahlkampf ist ma geschneidert f r eine koalition mit strache
7485892 hier unterstellt die vp dass sterreichs richterinnen und richter augenzwinkernde toleranz bei kindesmissbrauch ben das ist strikt zur ckzuweisen
7485893 auch hier wird der justiz subtil unterstellt bei ehrenmorden genitalverst mmelung und zwangsverheiratung milde zu sein
7485894 anstatt etwa integrationsma nahmen zu setzen baut die vp br cken zur fp verhetzung damit ist jedem klar die lieblingsvariante der vp nach der wahl ist schwarzblau
7485895 sp und vp wollen offenbar noch schnell ihren einfluss im milliardenschweren f rderbereich ber den wahltag hin berretten anders ist nicht zu erkl ren warum sie in gro koalition rer eintracht postenbesetzungen miteinander ausmachen die eigentlich erst 2009 zur debatte stehen w rden
7485896 es geht hier um das wie bei der vorgangsweise der ausschreibung es kann auch nicht im sinne der derzeitigen gesch ftsf hrerinnen sein nun wieder intensiver in den verdacht einer gro koalition ren proporzbesetzung zu kommen ein bewerbungsschluss am 25 9 erzeugt vor dem hintergrund des wahltermins am 28 9 eine schiefe optik wenn die arbeit der gesch ftsf hrerinnen so gut ist wie von der regierung stets kolportiert dann w ren sie auch beim ffentlichen hearing n chsten sommer als gewinnerinnen hervorgegangen
7485897 ich begr e die sp te einsicht von faymann nun nach mehrmaliger ablehnung seitens der sp die studiengeb hren doch noch vor der wahl abzuschaffen die sp schwenkt damit endlich auf eine zentrale forderung der gr nen ein das ist ein sch ner erfolg
7485898 ich bin schon sehr gespannt ob die sp nach aufk ndigung des stillhalteabkommens bereit sein wird noch vor der wahl auch bei anderen wichtigen fragen dem parlament endlich den n tigen freiraum einzur umen

7485902 ipswich have made us a written offer that was not bad but we will not sell novakovic
7485903 from the start i wanted to push my best but i had to save myself for the later stages of the race
7485904 in the heat it was difficult and the humidity made it harder but i was determined to finish strongly
7485905 in kenya we have many medals but im so happy to be the first kenyan to win an olympic marathon gold medal my next goal is to get the world record maybe next year
7485906 this was the greatest performance ever by kenya at the olympics and it surpasses the record of nine medals that was achieved at the seoul olympics in 1988
7485907 i would like to thank the athletes and officials for making the positive contribution to the performance and to the government and sponsors for their increased incentives
7485908 i wish i could have had the luxury like you of growing up and living and spending my entire life in a nice place like the first district of arizona but i was doing other things as a matter of fact when i think about it now the place i lived longest in my life was hanoi
7485909 sp t aber doch kann jetzt endlich f r die menschen etwas erreicht werden und langj hrige bz forderungenhaben eine echte chance auf umsetzung das bz steht f r das freie spiel der kr fte neben der sp ist auch die vp herzlich eingeladen vern nftige forderungen gemeinsam mit dem bz umzusetzen
7485910 bz spitzenkandidat lh j rg haider hat in einem freien spiel der kr fte erfolge wie die k rntner mindestsicherung den teuerungsausgleich oder den gratiskindergarten verwirklicht wir haben hier erfahrung und sind ein partner das ziel des bz ist es unsere langj hrigen forderungen zu realisieren mit wem ist uns egal denn dem bz mit j rg haider geht es um die probleme der menschen und nicht um die parteien
7485911 wenn die sp jetzt f r die verl ngerung der vom bz eingef hrten hacklerregelung eintritt dann ist diese sp te bekehrung zwar zu begr en zeigt aber deutlich dass das bz in der regierung richtig gehandelt hat w hrend die sp immer einige jahre braucht um auf den richtigen weg j rg haiders einzuschwenken
7485912 darabos hat sterreich echten schaden zugef gt deshalb ist es gerechtfertigt ihm das misstrauen auszusprechen
7485913 it would save the system a lot of money because i wouldnt have to redo things
7485914 this allows real time investigation of medications patients are taking right at the bedside
7485915 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7485916 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7485917 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7485918 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7485919 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7485920 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7485921 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7485922 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

7485959 by soul i mean first of all a perspective rather than a substance a viewpoint toward things rather than a thing itself this perspective is reflective it mediates events and makes differences between ourselves and everything that happens between us and events between the doer and the deed there is a reflective moment and soul making means differentiating this middle ground it is as if consciousness rests upon a self sustaining and imagining substrate an inner place or deeper person or ongoing presence that is simply there even when all our subjectivity ego and consciousness go into eclipse soul appears as a factor independent of the events in which we are immersed though i cannot identify soul with anything else i also can never grasp it apart from other things perhaps because it is like a reflection in a flowing mirror or like the moon which mediates only borrowed light but just this peculiar and paradoxical intervening variable gives on the sense of having or being soul however intangible and indefinable it is soul carries highest importance in hierarchies of human values frequently being identified with the principle of life and even of divinity in another attempt upon the idea of soul i suggest that the word refers to that unknown component which makes meaning possible turns events into experiences is communicated in love and has a religious concern these four qualifications i had already put forth some years ago i had begun to use the term freely usually interchangeably with psyche from greek and anima from latin now i am adding three necessary modifications first soul refers to the deepening of events into experiences second the significance of soul makes possible whether in love or in religious concern derives from its special relation with death and third by soul i mean the imaginative possibility in our natures the experiencing through reflective speculation dream image fantasy that mode which recognizes all realities as primarily symbolic or metaphorical

7486008 el freno del consumo es psicol gico en un 50 las familias han dejado de consumir por el efecto psicol gico por o r y o r hablar de crisis no porque los precios hayan subido o porque hayan perdido poder adquisitivo
7486009 la banca ha restringido el cr dito al consumo y la capacidad de endeudamiento de las tarjetas de cr dito

7486021 eine noch bessere vorbereitung auf die berufliche ausbildung ist eines der wichtigsten ziele das in der neuen realschule plus verfolgt werden soll bew hrte inhalte wie beispielsweise der praxistag und das fach arbeitslehre aus den hauptschulen das fach praxis in der schule aus den dualen oberschulen werden k nftig mit den in den regionalen schulen und realschulen erfolgreich angebotenen wahlpflichtbereichen ab der klassenstufe 6 kombiniert und in drei verpflichtenden wahlbereichen angeboten mit den bereichen technik und naturwissenschaften sowie hauswirtschaft und sozialwesen und wirtschaft und verwaltung wird dabei ein breites spektrum abgedeckt mit diesen ma nahmen und dem neuen projekt keine r ohne abschluss soll der anteil der schulabg ngerinnen und schulabg nger ohne einen abschluss in form der berufsreife deutlich weiter gesenkt werden
7486022 damit liegt der aktuelle wert im land um mehr als zwei ganze prozentpunkte unter dem landeswert von 1998 und mit der jetzigen quote liegt rheinland pfalz klar unter dem bundesdurchschnitt von 7 9 prozent aber damit k nnen wir uns nicht zufriedengeben wir wollen den anteil noch deutlich weiter senken
7486023 mit dem neuen projekt keine r ohne abschluss wollen wir nun in der realschule plus sch lerinnen und sch lern die nach der 9 klasse nicht die berufsreife erreicht haben eine neue zweite chance geben im bereits gewohnten schulischen und sozialen umfeld und mit zus tzlichen angeboten zur vorbereitung auf die berufsausbildung sollen diese sch lerinnen und sch ler mit speziellen lernarrangements doch noch zu einem abschluss im allgemeinbildenden schulsystem gef hrt werden
7486024 im rahmen der ganztagsschule soll dann die an den st rken der sch lerinnen und sch ler orientierte individuelle f rderung ansetzen die verpflichtende ganztagsschulstruktur bietet auch zus tzliche chancen soziale kompetenzen die im arbeitsleben erwartet werden zu betonen und f cherspezifische schw chen aufzuarbeiten
7486025 die mitarbeit der eltern ist wichtig damit die zus tzlich angebotene f rderung in der schule auch dauerhafte wirkung entfaltet wenn beispielsweise im rahmen von erweiterten elternabenden mit sch lerinnen sch lern lehrkr ften vertreterinnen oder vertretern der agentur f r arbeit die berufsorientierung in den blick genommen wird kann dies dem bereits im schulalltag durchgef hrten berufswahlunterricht zus tzliche impulse geben und zugleich die unterst tzung f r die m dchen und jungen in den elternh usern verbessern
7486026 als hochentwickelte industrie und dienstleistungsgesellschaft brauchen wir gut ausgebildete fachkr fte
7486027 diesen bedarf f r die zukunft zu sichern ist eine begr ndung f r die schulstrukturreform und f r die einf hrung der realschule plus wir wollen und m ssen jetzt vorsorge treffen deshalb ist es mir besonders wichtig dass wir nicht nur strukturen schaffen die mehr junge menschen zur hochschulreife f hren sondern wir m ssen auch die chancen vergr ern dass alle sch lerinnen und sch lern einen abschluss erwerben k nnen ich bin berzeugt das projekt keine r ohne abschluss wird einen beitrag dazu leisten und damit auch mehr chancengleichheit schaffen
7486028 es sind nicht die kinder welche probleme bereiten es sind die alten welche nie gelernt haben was freude am lernen und lebenslanges lernen bedeutet

7486035 we started by building a structure in the pepsi center which is essentially a main office and went underground to feed to customers
7486036 we essentially had to duplicate a lot of the infrastructure
7486037 as an example dnccs staff will be able to move among venue locations like invesco field and the hyatt hotel at the convention center with their cisco ip phones as they relocate depending on their changing functions

7486046 it would have been better if the labor party had read the detail in the greens policy because we apply a similar feed in tariff scheme to industrial and business rooftops as well
7486047 what this does is limit the solar uptake to just households
7486048 i think its far too early to be speculating about that and i think it would be wrong of me given the very complex human issues at heart involved in this
7486049 this is about a child and an adoptive family thats gone out of their way and done their best to give a child a new life and to make a family
7486050 it wont i think only come down to a matter of law

7486069 shocking pictures of a number of foreign women inmates in what you could describe as very compromising positions
7486070 the place is still for sale and nothing has happened since
7486071 i dont think the show has made a whole lot of difference to our bookings although there have been more families up here taking photographs of the hotel and grounds
7486072 we were absolutely delighted with failte towers it was a very good show we feel it came across very well and it was a gentleman john creedon who won it in the end
7486073 ive heard people saying that they must have had help cleaning the rooms or cooking but they didnt they did it all on their own there wasnt much work needed to be done by us to get the hotel back open it was fine
7486074 the dormitory was the only place that needed to be fixed up but the production team looked after that and outside was cleaned we really could have opened back up on the tuesday
7486075 brian and michelle were fantastic i think michelle came across quite well with the guests and was very friendly in general they were all very good and all did their best but brian and michelle really stood out
7486076 all our parents were ringing us telling us we were being called scum in the sun they kept bringing up a d4 thing
7486077 it has no relevance where im from people were saying if we were poor kids this wouldnt have happened most of us worked all summer to pay for this holiday it was because of this thing about fee paying schools
7486078 it was only a bit of noise on the first night adults were clenching fists at us and tensions were getting really high one threw an ashtray
7486079 fair enough we were noisy the first night but we just went for a really good holiday nobody broke glass in the pool there were only some families who were upset it has been blown out of the water there was one family with lots of kids who had no problem
7486080 there was no vomiting in the pool or people breaking glass there wasnt one window broken
7486081 my husband is being held in a basement cell and questioned over a photo he did not take
7486082 he was pulled from his place in shelton abbey where he was due to be released very shortly and dragged back to mountjoy over this photograph he didnt take it he wasnt even there
7486083 he came back from working on thursday night to find prison wardens waiting to handcuff him and transfer him immediately to mountjoy he didnt know what was going on and it wasnt until the next day that they told him they think he took that picture he told them he had nothing to do with it he might not have even been in the prison when it was taken because hes gone from there eight months but they arent listening
7486084 they think he took that picture and then sold it on to the papers they wont listen to him they have him locked in a basement cell with just a mattress and a pot to go to the toilet in he was due to be released soon and now all this at the last minute has thrown all that out the window
7486085 he had a clean slate he was a model prisoner he knows nothing about this picture or who took it we dont even know when it was taken he might have been in shelton abbey by then he has offered to take a lie detector test anything to prove he has nothing to do with this
7486086 that would target advanced hardware and modern mobile operating systems not even available at the time
7486087 as you flow further up the stream you may encounter a heavenly being if you do just take its hand
7486088 now feel yourself float upward into the heart of the christ the heart of the buddha all you need to do is accept the love and peace that is offered to you here
7486089 and now its time to come back gently come down the stream again to the top of your head flow down into your head come right back behind your own eyes while we still have so much light if you would like think of someone who you would like to hold in the light someone who is sick or just in need of a loving touch hold their image in front of you in the light suspend your own wishes for this person just imagine them being filled with the light and ask that their highest need be met
7486090 and now if you like hold your own image in this light suspend your wishes for yourself
7486091 imagine that you are being filled with beautiful golden light and now ask that your own highest need be met today
7486092 begin to come back out into the room rub your eyes stretch
7486093 i guess it was kind of strange but you know it felt really good

7486120 you cant change your whole philosophy on how you run and expect it to just click overnight
7486121 the good thing for us is we have our bye week early this year sept 28 and thats typically when you start to see the running game take off when you have a new scheme in
7486122 certainly were not going to just accept that but i think thats what ive seen during my years in the league
7486123 when you dont play a 3 4 defense a lot
7486124 it can be a little more difficult because it presents different blocking angles and a basis for how they attack you
7486125 its got to get better its got to be more consistent
7486126 we had a couple that broke in addition to smiths touchdown calhoun had a run of 40 yards which is good
7486127 but what i want is punishment i want to punish the defense
7486128 i want to take their legs out of them so they cant rush
7486129 we have to keep punishing the ball up inside and then theyll defend it and then we have a chance to use the big guys receivers outside

7486151 it was a situation this neighborhood has original sidewalks in it

7486153 i would think that when the projects are done in this area that everybody is going to be happy again

7486156 they are going to have to live in a society that is going to have to be more conservative with the use of fuel
7486157 as people drive less they are actually hurting the highways
7486158 people are consuming less motor fuel and not contributing as much back to the highway fund we want to keep everyone happy and healthy and to do that we need the funding
7486159 we have great transportation infrastructure however that infrastructure is aging and is almost 50 years old
7486160 unless there is some funding put into place we may go into simple maintenance mode
7486161 its cyclical it may drop 20 cents here and there but it will just continue to go higher

7486187 ill pop out and do a couple of questions on it for you all the other journalists have got this number so you might as well use it
7486188 im going to invite onto the programme everyone who hates me
7486189 i said ill do a deal first half hour you can ask me anything you want and the second half hour i can ask you anything i want he wouldnt do it
7486190 i would question him about his role in the death of dr david kelly i remember hearinghis controversial piece on the today programme it was quite early but my kids had woken up i heard him mention a senior intelligence source and i immediately thought one of the top ten people in mi6 has grassed up the government it turns out to be poor old david kelly basically what gilligan did was what has destroyed so many otherwise good coppers theyve caught a criminal but they havent got the evidence so they falsify the evidence if gilligan hadnt distorted what kelly had said grossly exaggerated it kelly would be alive today
7486191 i told him to his face youve been responsible for one persons death stay away from my family get off my doorstep
7486192 i knew because i was mayor that the met were not investigating this
7486193 and so farewell to happy days theres no more cash for londons gays
7486194 broadly its a right of centre industry i know this because i was once a sony radio awards judge and they gave me 24 hours of tapes to listen to the pattern seemed to be that you got an old journalist and they would do an opening rant about myra hindley too many immigrants and put all homosexuals on a small island and drop a bomb then every bigot in the land would phone in an absolutely pointless exercise
7486195 london is 10 years younger than the national average theres a huge concentration of young people and theyre all having sex its the most fecund place in britain
7486196 its about how to run a campaign about saving water ive got to advise and then judge which team is the best which i will hate
7486197 the mayor of shanghai is flying me out for a conference in november aboutcity economics im doing the keynote speech about what i think the future is for shanghai and the government of hong kong has got me going out to discuss the environment
7486198 oh yes kens junket to shanghai to have exotic discussions about the growth of international financial centres
7486199 i just think boris is mad not to havegone that opening ceremony i suspect was the most extravagant spectacle in human history it was stunning to watch and im glad i went
7486200 youd got headlines saying suicide bomb backer runs kens campaign followed by kens adviser is linked to terror group which came as news to him the adviser as he had the second highest clearance for mi5 because he is the auditor for the ministry of defence then they said boris was the new messiah people came to the conclusion that it wasnt balanced reporting
7486201 every black person who worked for me was acrook and every asian was a terrorist was the broad theme
7486202 somebody inside the building broke into lee jaspers computer and downloaded eight years of letters and emails
7486203 how are you going to prove it by the time we knew there was no chance of finding anyones fingerprints it had most probably happened weeks if not months before the standard started using it
7486204 i particularly like the londonpaper because they set out to have a paper thats positive about london whereas if the only thing you knew about london was from the evening standard you wouldnt come here for fear of being mugged raped or ripped off its all doom like the daily mail
7486205 lord rothermere came to see me and i told him that i aimed to get the maximum amount for it and that if somebody else bids more than you do theyll get it i suspect a lot of the venom was because of their paranoid fear that i would try and rig the thing the reality is that its no great shakes to me whether its run by rothermere or rupert murdoch neither are going to be particularly progressive i was going to have an auction on the internet for the rights
7486206 we got three times what we expected we got so much more than we expected that we didnt need a bus fare increase this year
7486207 when i first got really interested in politics in the sixties all the quality papers had an entire page reporting mps speeches there would be the single salient point that was most important in a speech in the paper the next morning
7486208 when the media followed murdoch down the electronic route we were promised that the savings would mean more extensive foreign coverage and everywhere there is less than there was
7486209 there are people who never did anything and im not terribly interested in their opinions i dont want to pick out anybody but catherine bennett of the observer would be a good start why is anyone interested in her opinions has she written great literature produced great art work run a major corporation been elected to office or is she just paid to produce bile
7486210 you might as well pop into the local pub and say whats your opinion its equally valid
7486211 over the last three months the only place you could get really good coverage of city hall was on the blogs
7486212 they havent got off their backsides and logged on to answer all this right wing drivel
7486213 its a 24 7 job if boris had told londoners what he proposed to do which was to appoint tim parker to do the job i was doing whilst he went back to writing his quarter of a million pound column for the telegraph he wouldnt have been elected
7486214 you are worse off than you were four years ago
7486215 are you better off now than you were four years ago
7486216 nee natwoordde ik doe maar niet heb je weer een paar dagen last van je benen misschien ik liep dus rustig richting satation week zelfs
7486217 dacht ik met de glimlach rond mijn lippen ze hebben vast een lesje klantvriendelijkheid gehad naar aanleiding van mijn belletje van vorige week
7486218 er zijn vertraagde treinen hij zal vast wel eens komen
7486219 wij vertrekken vijf minuten later dan gepland excuses voor de vertraging
7486220 ik had het kunnen weten denk ik nog de trein zag inderdaad wat bleekjes en lag uitgeteld op haar zij
7486221 en dan manlief laten strooien met de zwarte handschoen aan
7486222 je krijgt dan direct wat beweging dan is snoepen verantwoord en kom je niet zoveel aan
7486223 wees flexibel in het leven want dan kun je je draaien bij wind dan kun je zelfs bij tegenwind nog werken en kan het je nog energie opleveren ook
7486224 dat is weer een kostenpostje op de rekening van n
7486225 tussen meppel en steenwijk rijden geen treinen u wordt per bus vervoerd
7486226 er is een storing met de deuren ze willen niet meer dicht we roepen de monterur op en weten niet hoelang het gaat duren excuses
7486227 but why would you call a band that i dont get it
7486228 no girls hardly ever got to play and anyway i had an ongoing fear of flying objects near my head because i didnt know my eyes were crap until i was nineteen
7486229 well you know when someone tried to get you and you were safe from them youd say
7486230 that my dad told me when he was little they used to say fayknights
7486231 u moet ze dopen dat heeft u ook met mijn kinderen gedaan en sindsdien hebben ze geen stap meer in de kerk gezet
7486232 zo zaten we een hele poos totdat de mensen om ons heen vertokken tot de zon onderging en het licht veranderde totdat we het gevoel hadden dat we elkaar weer konden aankijken zonder tranen
7486233 is een fiets die op slot staat in de tuin en gestolen wordt verzekerd via de inboedelverzekering
7486234 nee zei hij ik moet er toch een halte eerder uit dan zij
7486235 toen hij uitstapte en we bij vertrek hem passerden stak ik bemoedigend mijn duim op succes jongen
7486236 als het leven dat je leiden moet anders is dan voorheen
7486237 ik hou enorm van sport en ik heb zelf ook op judo gezeten
7486238 als het leven dat je leiden moet anders is dan voor heen
7486239 i still believe its an advantage if you know how to win a u s open
7486240 i think he definitely didnt have his best day against me but playing him nine times i guess hes bound to have one off day out of all of them because there are times when i felt like there was nothing i could do
7486241 the goal is still the same and the pressure is still the same
7486242 the goal is to continue to improve my tennis and to continue playing a very good tournament
7486243 rafa will now feel what i had to feel for a very long time
7486244 so it will be interesting to see how he handles it but so far hes been great and hes played so well on all surfaces now maybe its nice to go into a grand slam for a change not having no 1 next to me and it should be interesting
7486245 i think its tough to play perfect for five years in a row
7486246 i think one big result and its turned around for him i know pretty much every player except for one that would take his bad year so i think you have to use a little bit of perspective hes created a monster for himself

7486256 i was probably the most visible hillary supporter there was
7486257 she didnt win i can accept that and i think most people are accepting that
7486258 bottom line we as a party cant afford another bush kind of term
7486259 i liked hillary i saw what she went through with the republicans and she didnt cave in
7486260 but i am not about to vote republican because she isnt the nominee
7486261 the council has said they didnt want to have layoffs but personnel is 83 percent of the police departments budget
7486262 if the departments can cut their budgets a minimum of 5 percent maybe we can use reserves to stem the tide a while until we get a handle of whats going on
7486263 the council has eliminated some items and added others that werent included in the budget

7486279 tilt the balance of numbers in their favour during the voting for the speaker of parliament
7486280 to tell you the truth i had no idea how it is supposed to be spelled
7486281 she said lets sit down and think it through analytically
7486282 lets talk about the downsides and risks and lets have a plan for how well manage that
7486283 first time in my adult life that ive been really proud of my country
7486284 since she is so public and so willing to express her views and be blunt it draws attention
7486285 but i think the more the public gets to know her in more intimate settings the more theyll appreciate what an asset shell be in the white house
7486286 the way our family worked you kind of naturally did the best you could
7486287 i think a lot of it has to do with the fact that we saw our father get up every day and go to work with an affliction like ms and never complain or feel sorry for himself and always be supportive of what we were doing
7486288 my experience at princeton has made me far more aware of my blackness than ever before
7486289 unlike most college kids looking for themselves she was not unsure of who she was
7486290 she was going to prove to him that she was going to keep her commitment to be like her brother a college graduate and a professional school graduate and someone who gave something back to the community
7486291 michelle was extraordinary at figuring out what the problem was how many different departments were involved and pulling people together
7486292 shes totally analytical practical and insightful add to that these extraordinary people skills
7486293 she will talk about difficult issues openly and its very disarming because she is direct
7486294 but shes also kind and approachable so people are more likely to talk about whats really going on
7486295 almost every time the candidates wife speaks extemporaneously she seems to offer some bon mot consistent with that bleak assessment
7486296 theyve been focused on trying to create a michelle obama who doesnt exist
7486297 she was the one who really challenged me to think about that in terms of the change i wanted to make and how that would translate not just to my community but on a broader scale
7486298 if suzanne or i picked up the phone and needed or wanted anything she was here in a heartbeat
7486299 suzannes death was the first time i really got to see the depth of her love for her friends how loyal she is

7486305 hay cansancio eso lo hemos evidenciado hay p rdida del sentido de lucha y por eso creemos que hay una situaci n madura para las desmovilizaciones colectivas el reto es convencerlos de que tambi n con ellos podemos pactar procesos dignos
7486306 es indudable que la capacidad militar del erg se disminuy por la ofensiva militar si no es as ellos no habr an recapacitado pero tambi n se les ofreci una negociaci n digna queremos enviar ese mensaje que el gobierno sabe tender la mano
7486307 the new temple will not play quite the same part in the life of the people as did the previous structures because sin having been abolished there will be no need for expiatory sacrifices
7486308 in the meantime i will oversee and be responsible for all financial operations of the company while the completion of our year end audit and getting our financial reporting up to date is of paramount importance business operations continue at both our shanghai and tengzhou manufacturing facilities and we remain optimistic about our future once our regulatory filings are up to date we will apply for a revocation of the cease trade order which we fully expect to obtain

7486310 det f rh llandet att avtalen med investmentbanker medgav att bankerna anlitade kommunikationskonsulter som underleverant rer och att dessa skulle godk nnas av regeringskansliet kan enligt utskottets mening inte ses som ett kringg ende av upphandlingslagens regler eftersom kommunikationskonsulternas uppdrag kan antas utg ra ett inslag i de aktuella finansiella tj nsterna

7486329 we have recently commenced proceedings against parties involved in the production and distribution of a movie entitled hari puttar
7486330 warner bros values and protects intellectual property rights however it is our policy not to discuss publicly the details of any ongoing litigation

7486352 the population of georgia will feel more safe from today from the russian aggression
7486353 they will feel safe not because the destroyer is here but because they will feel they are not alone facing the russian aggression

7486363 it takes you through a valley of pleasure and sexual grace
7486364 we are trying to raise the profile but we are finding it very difficult to get recognition they see women as always being the victims never the perpetrator
7486365 it is totally unreported we are trying to flag this up and say please see there is a need for services we need to do a pilot project and get statistics
7486366 there should be an equivalent agency to help men as there is for women and children i wrote to the minister and got a reply back on 7 may saying there is no need for such a service and it is covered by things like victim support i dont think thats correct and i want to continue to press him and the scottish government and get a credible response to this to make sure there is a proper dedicated facility
7486367 lewis and nicole are getting pretty serious theyre almost living in each others pockets as it is but were hearing that they may be about to buy a place together
7486368 it would only be a part time base because lewis is based in switzerland
7486369 the fact they are planning to get a place shows how serious theyve become
7486370 orangina is a drink which is mainly aimed at children and young people but this new advert places the product in a very sexualised and provocative context
7486371 the almost sinister portrayal of animals in an animation style filled with sexual innuendo leads to very mixed and confused messages

7486373 we are human beings we hold jobs and we are productive hiv aids is not about people who go to prostitutes or drug addicts its also about housewives and children it is in households people say im a victim because i contracted it from my husband but to a prostitute they say oh she deserves it its not about blame any more

7486379 i felt really bad for her now i know why i couldnt recognise her when i met her life has put her through so much she had changed
7486380 believe me it was really sad when jade was slammed
7486381 i never wanted to become a champion of the third world at her cost
7486382 i only had a chance to speak to her before she left i will meet her when i go to london for the unforgettables tour with the bachchan
7486383 despite what they thought i honestly felt there was more mileage for her
7486384 but seeing as they havent killed her off i guess there is still a chance she could wander back one day
7486385 those scenes were some of my last on the show and i can honestly say that the tears are real
7486386 i was so upset to be leaving i have had an amazing time and the thought of not working with perry any more is heartbreaking
7486387 this is all just complete nonsense i am horrified that someone could do this to us its hurtful and upsetting first of all i have never heard of this man jack and he is not any friend of ours
7486388 rex and gazza certainly didnt sneak off to the toilet to take drugs i never saw anything like that happening
7486389 the more rubbish that gets said about me and rex the more it makes me think that these girls who say they slept with rex are lying too
7486390 sometimes i sit at the office reading your blog and looking at all the pictures and im a little jealous im glad that i stopped over today and get to see that nobody can do it all
7486391 im sure thats not anything thats new to him tomlin said of peterson facing stacked lines im sure he saw quite a few eight nine man fronts in oklahoma and in high school and in every level of competition hes been in he sees it because hes a special player hes a special runner hes found ways to be successful in the past im sure hell find ways to be successful in the future

7486395 spaeth has been rock solid for us as a tight end we use quite a few two tight end sets hes the 12th starter on our offense if you will a very reliable guy an emerging second year guy

7486398 i just know a little bit about the kids i have been around them for two years and recruited a bunch of them
7486399 i dont think it gives us an advantage hammock said they have a new scheme a new philosophy

7486413 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will ever again live in one state with georgia
7486414 right after the conflict with georgia russia would look very indecent if it immediately annexed south ossetia and abkhazia

7486424 zimbabweans believe that the only person who is capable of removing mugabe from power is tsvangirai hence they are prepared to forgive him for all the blunders he is making
7486425 however people are getting impatient over the delayed resolution of the political and economic problems facing the country and he needs to be careful
7486426 as far as we are concerned we dont see anything wrong with that it will have no effect
7486427 parliament is an expression of the will of the people but cabinet is another thing
7486428 this programme provides llb graduates with an opportunity to serve their articles through university law clinics ulcs as well as giving legal services to disadvantaged communities
7486429 we have taken note of everything said here today people want practical answers and we will make sure we do that
7486430 the people sitting in the front here are elected by you this is your government and it is expected that they will address your grievances
7486431 i think all of us know what the problems are the question is what to do about it
7486432 roads need to be tarred there are problems of stock theft people without water and housing lack of employment and those with qualifications not being able to find a job
7486433 our roads are bad and need to be tarred we also dont have a clinic community hall or a high school in our area
7486434 i am an assistant foreman at a chrome mine in swartklip i have two children who are both attending a primary school
7486435 i would however like to tell the president that we need our roads tarred we need a high school and the facilities at the local george stegman hospital need to improve
7486436 i come from mooinooi in brits which is under the madibeng local municipality and there are three mines which operate around our community
7486437 the mining companies go to rustenburg to get their labour though and dont employ the unemployed people from our village
7486438 the key to breaking the sound barrier is simply being friendly and talkative when were out and about
7486439 it will be a similar situation to what ruby walsh does wednesdays fridays and saturdays will be the three main days and some tuesdays there will be plenty of travelling but i live close enough to dublin airport
7486440 ive been travelling over plenty over the past few years so im well used to it
7486441 i was thrilled to get the offer its a big yard with plenty of good horses and a nice man to deal with nicky is brilliant hes very easy to work for
7486442 it was definitely a help it was probably good timing hes only five and seemed to improve from cheltenham to punchestown so id be hoping he can keep improving
7486443 hes definitely a contender for the champion hurdle in march as he only has a few lengths to find from last year
7486444 theres jack the giant as well he looks progressive and barbers shop who was second in the jewson chase to look forward to
7486445 the quality racing here is on sundays anyway jessica harrington is very happy with everything and shes a good pal of nickys so theres no conflict there
7486446 shola is back with us and he will be in full training on monday hes fit and i am quite happy to have him back
7486447 for 2 4m where am i going to get a player like shola
7486448 he knows the premier league and the club and he understands the area i dont look at it as a minus at all
7486449 who knows he might be our top scorer this season i wouldnt put it past him
7486450 all this stuff terry has been getting at home all this bulls t is not nice
7486451 hes like a dad to all the team and he doesnt need all this in his life
7486452 hes produced three medals in these olympics and we havent had that for years whats happening is pathetic because he must be doing something right
7486453 weve all got respect for him if they brought in somebody else we would probably take the p ss out of him
7486454 its hard to say no to a million pounds but if they come to me with a sensible offer and terry is ok well that could be me signing for four years and going into the next olympics
7486455 i could be a little superstar in amateur boxing and i could earn some decent dough winning another gold medal in 2012 in my home city imagine that and to be the face of the london olympics would be unbelievable
7486456 deep in my heart i think london 2012 thats me if terry stays thats me i think he could keep four or five of us from the beijing team
7486457 earlier this month i said that beijing would be me finished but now im thinking right ok im going to 2012
7486458 if they want to sack me then they will have to sack me i shall face the music when i go back and answer all the allegations
7486459 but one things for certain if i were to go forward for the next four years i wouldnt put up with the crap that ive suffered in the last four years thats for sure
7486460 there was a time when i said i dont need this and that maybe i should spend more time at home which is something my wife deserves
7486461 but the way i feel now having seen the team exceed its targets and with a record of three olympic finals in three olympics and two gold medals i do have this urge to carry on
7486462 you can see he is so full of confidence i thought if i got to twelve under par then darren would have to shoot under par to win which is never easy in the fourth round
7486463 but then he had a wonderful run of birdies in the middle of his round and now nick faldo has got a lot of options for the wild cards
7486464 patients tend to want to help so we tie them down nothing to worry about
7486465 ok were going to numb the area now you may feel a pinprick
7486466 oh thats the 4 clamps used to keep you scrotum open
7486467 i was adjusting one of the clamps and accidentally clamped the shaft of your penis
7486468 im going to lunch now but brian will be taking over for an hour dont worry ill be back

7486483 we are working day and night and well but since the process started it has become more difficult than we expected due to the bad state of some of the dna samples said rubalcaba
7486484 if the sample can be matched to someone close like a brother or father it is easy but when there are only distant family members available it becomes much more complicated he added
7486485 will anybody remain unidentified i cant say at this moment but the possibility exists he said during an interview with news radio cadena ser
7486486 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7486487 this is a planning took where all things are going
7486488 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7486489 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7486490 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7486491 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7486492 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7486493 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7486494 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7486495 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7486496 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7486497 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7486498 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7486499 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7486500 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7486501 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7486502 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7486503 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7486504 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7486505 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7486506 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7486507 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7486508 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7486509 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7486510 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7486511 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7486512 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7486513 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7486514 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7486515 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7486516 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7486517 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7486518 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7486519 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7486520 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7486521 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7486522 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7486523 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7486524 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7486525 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7486526 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7486527 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7486528 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7486529 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7486530 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7486531 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7486532 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7486533 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7486534 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7486535 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7486536 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7486537 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7486538 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7486539 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7486540 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7486541 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7486542 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7486543 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7486544 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7486545 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7486546 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7486547 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7486548 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7486549 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7486550 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7486551 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7486552 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7486553 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7486554 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7486555 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7486556 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7486557 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7486558 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7486559 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7486560 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7486561 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7486562 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7486563 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7486564 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7486565 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7486566 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7486567 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7486568 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7486569 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7486570 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7486571 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7486572 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7486573 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7486574 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7486575 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7486576 cest l tude l ventuelle interdiction ndlr nous regardons ce que nous pouvons faire l galement
7486577 go where the facts and evidence take you and do whats right
7486578 you might not think its stupid at the time either
7486579 maybe theres no curtain though and no intermissions but all the worlds a stage right
7486580 i suppose but you and the others are about to hit act ii and thats where the drama really starts
7486581 i care about christina too much to do anything to hurt her
7486582 you have a lot of self control that i didnt have at your age
7486583 its like trying to draw when your hands are shaking you cant make it come out right
7486584 i told her its too soon were both really not old enough
7486585 she doesnt get it she said something like being ready whenever i am
7486586 they probably think im a total snake anyway the way they look at me
7486587 at least guillermo doesnt he knows whos pushing who i dont know about maria theyre just really worried and so are we but i dont think they blame you
7486588 ive tried to explain their own daughter to them and ill try explaining your girlfriend to you christina is probably a genius shes as bright as anyone ive known and ive known some seriously intelligent people the thing about geniuses is they like to make their own rules look at it this way though any painting even a masterpiece needs a canvas to give it structure right now youre the canvas shes painting herself on its a huge responsibility and its not fair to you but at least youve got us to help you
7486589 huh i didnt think about that but yeah we give the painting and the canvas some boundaries and a lot of support
7486590 you sure you want to do this give me some pointers
7486591 well guess what reading about something and experiencing it are two different things
7486592 yeah the changes start before you start having periods mood swings intense feelings its your own personal biochemistry experiment and you dont have a choice about being the subject of it
7486593 some would say so but i dont agree its the easy way out sure thats part of it but were more than just our hormones we might not be able to control what they do to us but we can control what we do to other people or with them
7486594 mama and papa said it was a phase or a crush something id get over i thought that was an easy answer too what you say gives me a better overview
7486595 i understand a little better now but it doesnt help how i feel about kim or explain it
7486596 well like i told kim geniuses like to make their own rules if one of the rules you make is to not let hormones override your good sense what you know is right and wrong youll be ok

7486652 our best intelligence estimate is that pandemic avian flu has already been created through genetic engineering in the united states fusing the deadly genome of the 1918 pandemic misnamed the spanish flu with the dna of the innocuous h5n1 virus in a growth medium of human kidney cells according to the national institutes of health and the vaccines manufacturer some virologists believe that this would insure that the man made mutant virus recognizes human cells and knows how to invade them
7486653 a basic virological fact that the public has not been told is that it is impossible to make a vaccine against a virus that does not yet exist
7486654 given the shockingly obvious lack of any threat from an un weaponized h5n1 virus how can we explain the bush administration spending billions of dollars preparing each of the 50 states for what it calls the inevitable bird flu pandemic which they say could kill half or more of all americans and similar numbers of people around the globe
7486655 tyson foods inc has begun killing and burying the carcasses of 15 000 hens from a flock that tested positive for exposure to a strain of the bird flu in northwest arkansas state officials said tuesday
7486656 one of the highest rates of injury and illness of any industry
7486657 dangerous chemicals blood faecal matter exacerbated by poor ventilation and often extreme temperatures workers typically faced hazardous conditions loud noise must work in narrow confines with sharp tools and dangerous machinery
7486658 an experiment mating h5n1 avian flu viruses and a strain of human flu in a laboratory produced a surprising number of hybrid viruses that were biologically fit a new study reveals and while none of the offspring viruses was as virulent as the original h5n1 about one in five were lethal to mice at low doses showing they retained at least a portion of the power of their dangerous parent
7486659 the work suggests that under the right circumstances and no one is clear what all of those are the two types of flu viruses could swap genes in a way that might allow the h5n1 virus to acquire the capacity to trigger a pandemic that process is called reassortment this study is just showing exactly that there is a risk this virus can successfully reassort with a human virus said richard webby director of the world health organizations collaborating centre for influenza research at st jude hospital in memphis tennessee
7486660 terrifying biological weapons capable of killing only people of specific ethnic groups
7486661 the u s government is taking steps to minimize the need to make vaccine allocation decisions by supporting efforts to increase domestic influenza vaccine production capacity significant funding is being provided to develop new vaccine technologies that allow production of enough pandemic influenza vaccine for any person in the united states who wants to be vaccinated within six months of a pandemic declaration
7486662 two injections given 28 days apart may provide limited protection if a pandemic occurs
7486663 if h5n1 does mutate it is unclear if vaccines developed now would still work against a pandemic strain
7486664 three polish doctors and six nurses are facing criminal prosecution after a number of homeless people died following medical trials for a vaccine to the h5n1 bird flu virus
7486665 the spanish flu influenza virus that killed 20 40 million people in 1918 is currently under reconstruction several genes of the extraordinarily lethal 1918 flu virus have been isolated and introduced into contemporary flu strains these proved to be lethal for mice while virus constructs with genes from a current flu virus types had hardly any effect these experiments may easily be abused for military purposes but provide little benefit from a medical or public health point of view
7486666 the 1918 spanish flu was highly infectious and in comparison to contemporary flu viruses killed a very high percentage of those infected including many younger people the spanish flu alone caused the medium life expectancy in the us in 1918 to drop by 10 years hence flu viruses are perceived today as a serious biological warfare threat just two weeks ago a 15 million dollar research grant was awarded in the us to develop protective measures especially against a bioterrorist attack with flu viruses
7486667 despite the very dangerous nature of the 1918 virus efforts to reconstruct it started in the mid 1990s when dr jeffrey taubenberger from the us armed forces institute of pathology in washington dc succeeded in recovering and sequencing fragments of the viral rna from preserved tissues of 1918 victims in the current issue of the scientific journal emerging infectious diseases new genetic details of the 1918 flu virus will be published
7486668 but after partially unravelling the genetic sequence of the virus the scientists went a step further and began bringing the spanish flu back to life unnoticed by the public they succeeded in creating a live virus containing two 1918 genes that proved to be very lethal in animal experiments this experiment is only one genetic step away from taking the 1918 demon entirely out of the bottle
7486669 a resuscitation of the spanish flu is neither necessary nor warranted from a public health point of view
7486670 were tempted to say that nobody in their right mind would ever use these things
7486671 sanofi pasteur the vaccines division of sanofi aventis group announced today that the us department of health and human services hhs has accepted h5n1 bulk vaccine antigen to produce approximately 38
7486672 donate 60 million doses of h5n1 vaccine to the world health organization who over 3 years for the establishment of an h5n1 vaccine global stockpile
7486673 the h5n1 virus is currently circulating in some of the poorest regions of the world and an outbreak of pandemic influenza would most likely hit populations living in areas with limited access to vaccines this donation of h5n1 vaccine aims to address the needs of those most vulnerable populations in addition to supporting the efforts of governments
7486674 it is essential that industry collaborates with international organizations such as who the bill and melinda gates foundation and other global health players
7486675 a disease that turned people the color of wet ashes and drowned them in the fluids of their own bodies and inspired names like the purple death
7486676 the transformation of poultry production in asia in recent decades is staggering in the southeast asian countries where most of the bird flu outbreaks are concentrated thailand indonesia and viet nam production jumped eightfold in just 30 years from around 300 000 metric tonnes mt of chicken meat in 1971 to 2 440 000 mt in 2001 chinas production of chicken tripled during the 1990s to over 9 million metric tons per year

7486710 the law enforcement agencies have been directed to monitor the activities and movements of those people who are somehow linked with it and take action against them as per the law
7486711 we encourage the government of china to demonstrate respect for human rights including freedom of expression and freedom of religion of all people during the olympic games and beyond
7486712 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7486713 it was about two or three months ago all the taxis in our company had this fitted
7486714 for the first time foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china there will be no censorship on the internet
7486715 compared to similar efforts in other states chinas filtering regime is pervasive sophisticated and effective it comprises multiple levels of legal regulation and technical control it involves numerous state agencies and thousands of public and private personnel it censors content transmitted through multiple methods including web pages web logs on line discussion forums university bulletin board systems and e mail messages
7486716 propaganda harmful to national security and social stability of the peoples republic
7486717 after the olympic games are over the chinese authorities will probably come down very heavily on the tibetans they will also bring more armed forces inside tibet and increase the transfer of han population the post olympics is therefore more dangerous than the present moment
7486718 need to maintain pressure on china for human rights reform after the beijing olympics
7486719 abuses including the torture and ill treatment of prisoners use of the death penalty censorship restrictions on assembly and repression of minorities are still commonplace in china
7486720 we must learn lessons from this issue march april demonstrations and organise our masses to build up an impregnable fortress against the tide of encirclement to beat our enemy so you the leaders of work units must guard your gates and manage your people well let leaders of street committees be vigilant and keep watch on all outsiders
7486721 propaganda and education are our partys greatest advantages these are the most useful weapons with which to defend ourselves against the dalai lama group
7486722 china will find that controlling the internet is easier than taming price pressures officials in beijing have compliant executives at google and yahoo helping them censor cyberspace even after employing all of the conventional tools of economic policy cooling inflation is easier said than done

7486729 shola is back with us and he will be in full training on monday hes fit and i am quite happy to have him back
7486730 for 2 4m where am i going to get a player like shola
7486731 he knows the premier league and the club and he understands the area i dont look at it as a minus at all
7486732 who knows he might be our top scorer this season i wouldnt put it past him
7486733 it will be a similar situation to what ruby walsh does wednesdays fridays and saturdays will be the three main days and some tuesdays there will be plenty of travelling but i live close enough to dublin airport
7486734 ive been travelling over plenty over the past few years so im well used to it
7486735 i was thrilled to get the offer its a big yard with plenty of good horses and a nice man to deal with nicky is brilliant hes very easy to work for
7486736 it was definitely a help it was probably good timing hes only five and seemed to improve from cheltenham to punchestown so id be hoping he can keep improving
7486737 hes definitely a contender for the champion hurdle in march as he only has a few lengths to find from last year
7486738 theres jack the giant as well he looks progressive and barbers shop who was second in the jewson chase to look forward to
7486739 the quality racing here is on sundays anyway jessica harrington is very happy with everything and shes a good pal of nickys so theres no conflict there
7486740 you can see he is so full of confidence i thought if i got to twelve under par then darren would have to shoot under par to win which is never easy in the fourth round
7486741 but then he had a wonderful run of birdies in the middle of his round and now nick faldo has got a lot of options for the wild cards
7486742 the combination of incremental weakness in the european economy and the lower oil prices should keep the pressure on euro dollar in our view
7486743 the easing of tropical storm fay and the pullout of russian troops from georgia has taken some risk premium out of the market
7486744 but there will be some degree of geopolitical tensions as long as russia still has troops stationed in georgia
7486745 even with oil prices down the global liquidity crunch remains very much with us
7486746 u s and european portfolio managers continue to reduce risk in their portfolios emerging markets are the higher risk asset class hence we are suffering disproportionately
7486747 i felt bad it was tough but we were aiming to finish second and i did it
7486748 it was not easy for lewis but he did the job
7486749 again we suffered with a reliability problem this time on kimis car which lost us precious points
7486750 now we have to find out what happened in yet another engine failure and then decide how to react
7486751 clearly what happened is serious and we will have to do all in our power to make up for the ground we have lost through reliability problems in the coming races
7486752 the most positive element for us was that the boxes containing our spare parts were kept closed all weekend
7486753 we didnt need to fit a single replacement part throughout a race weekend that everyone thought would be full of crashes
7486754 now we can work hard for the final third of the season which begins with the back to back races at spa and monza two particularly challenging circuits that will put maximum stress on the engines
7486755 all this stuff terry has been getting at home all this bulls t is not nice
7486756 hes like a dad to all the team and he doesnt need all this in his life
7486757 hes produced three medals in these olympics and we havent had that for years whats happening is pathetic because he must be doing something right
7486758 weve all got respect for him if they brought in somebody else we would probably take the p ss out of him
7486759 its hard to say no to a million pounds but if they come to me with a sensible offer and terry is ok well that could be me signing for four years and going into the next olympics
7486760 i could be a little superstar in amateur boxing and i could earn some decent dough winning another gold medal in 2012 in my home city imagine that and to be the face of the london olympics would be unbelievable
7486761 deep in my heart i think london 2012 thats me if terry stays thats me i think he could keep four or five of us from the beijing team
7486762 earlier this month i said that beijing would be me finished but now im thinking right ok im going to 2012
7486763 if they want to sack me then they will have to sack me i shall face the music when i go back and answer all the allegations
7486764 but one things for certain if i were to go forward for the next four years i wouldnt put up with the crap that ive suffered in the last four years thats for sure
7486765 there was a time when i said i dont need this and that maybe i should spend more time at home which is something my wife deserves
7486766 but the way i feel now having seen the team exceed its targets and with a record of three olympic finals in three olympics and two gold medals i do have this urge to carry on
7486767 we propose continuing negotiations within the framework of the working group on wto accession but informing our partners of the need to exit some agreements which currently oppose the interests of the russian federation

7486826 this is a great joy for our mothers and our people but it remains a small step because we left behind us thousands of prisoners
7486827 its not easy to release prisoners especially prisoners that were involved directly in terrorist acts against innocent civilians
7486828 there is no doubt that we seek peace and we are trying to seek our goals and there wont be peace without the release of all prisoners
7486829 ill pop out and do a couple of questions on it for you all the other journalists have got this number so you might as well use it
7486830 im going to invite onto the programme everyone who hates me
7486831 i said ill do a deal first half hour you can ask me anything you want and the second half hour i can ask you anything i want he wouldnt do it
7486832 i would question him about his role in the death of dr david kelly i remember hearinghis controversial piece on the today programme it was quite early but my kids had woken up i heard him mention a senior intelligence source and i immediately thought one of the top ten people in mi6 has grassed up the government it turns out to be poor old david kelly basically what gilligan did was what has destroyed so many otherwise good coppers theyve caught a criminal but they havent got the evidence so they falsify the evidence if gilligan hadnt distorted what kelly had said grossly exaggerated it kelly would be alive today
7486833 i told him to his face youve been responsible for one persons death stay away from my family get off my doorstep
7486834 i knew because i was mayor that the met were not investigating this
7486835 and so farewell to happy days theres no more cash for londons gays
7486836 broadly its a right of centre industry i know this because i was once a sony radio awards judge and they gave me 24 hours of tapes to listen to the pattern seemed to be that you got an old journalist and they would do an opening rant about myra hindley too many immigrants and put all homosexuals on a small island and drop a bomb then every bigot in the land would phone in an absolutely pointless exercise
7486837 london is 10 years younger than the national average theres a huge concentration of young people and theyre all having sex its the most fecund place in britain
7486838 its about how to run a campaign about saving water ive got to advise and then judge which team is the best which i will hate
7486839 the mayor of shanghai is flying me out for a conference in november aboutcity economics im doing the keynote speech about what i think the future is for shanghai and the government of hong kong has got me going out to discuss the environment
7486840 oh yes kens junket to shanghai to have exotic discussions about the growth of international financial centres
7486841 i just think boris is mad not to havegone that opening ceremony i suspect was the most extravagant spectacle in human history it was stunning to watch and im glad i went
7486842 youd got headlines saying suicide bomb backer runs kens campaign followed by kens adviser is linked to terror group which came as news to him the adviser as he had the second highest clearance for mi5 because he is the auditor for the ministry of defence then they said boris was the new messiah people came to the conclusion that it wasnt balanced reporting
7486843 every black person who worked for me was acrook and every asian was a terrorist was the broad theme
7486844 somebody inside the building broke into lee jaspers computer and downloaded eight years of letters and emails
7486845 how are you going to prove it by the time we knew there was no chance of finding anyones fingerprints it had most probably happened weeks if not months before the standard started using it
7486846 i particularly like the londonpaper because they set out to have a paper thats positive about london whereas if the only thing you knew about london was from the evening standard you wouldnt come here for fear of being mugged raped or ripped off its all doom like the daily mail
7486847 lord rothermere came to see me and i told him that i aimed to get the maximum amount for it and that if somebody else bids more than you do theyll get it i suspect a lot of the venom was because of their paranoid fear that i would try and rig the thing the reality is that its no great shakes to me whether its run by rothermere or rupert murdoch neither are going to be particularly progressive i was going to have an auction on the internet for the rights
7486848 we got three times what we expected we got so much more than we expected that we didnt need a bus fare increase this year
7486849 when i first got really interested in politics in the sixties all the quality papers had an entire page reporting mps speeches there would be the single salient point that was most important in a speech in the paper the next morning
7486850 when the media followed murdoch down the electronic route we were promised that the savings would mean more extensive foreign coverage and everywhere there is less than there was
7486851 there are people who never did anything and im not terribly interested in their opinions i dont want to pick out anybody but catherine bennett of the observer would be a good start why is anyone interested in her opinions has she written great literature produced great art work run a major corporation been elected to office or is she just paid to produce bile
7486852 you might as well pop into the local pub and say whats your opinion its equally valid
7486853 over the last three months the only place you could get really good coverage of city hall was on the blogs
7486854 they havent got off their backsides and logged on to answer all this right wing drivel
7486855 its a 24 7 job if boris had told londoners what he proposed to do which was to appoint tim parker to do the job i was doing whilst he went back to writing his quarter of a million pound column for the telegraph he wouldnt have been elected
7486856 we made up about 30 seconds in the last part of the race
7486857 if thats what it takes to win then we do it its always really tough with traffic they are racing and we are racing i saw two or three gt cars racing while i was trying to catch the leader i cant waste time or tires and its not easy to find the right way we didnt touch anyone today so we did ok
7486858 we were passing backward and forward it was a joy to be a part of it

7486901 definitely worlds definitely commonwealth games if i go two years its like you may as well go another two years but to actually think of the four year concept its too hard to commit to that
7486902 for me right now to digest four years is very difficult and i think if i was thinking only about four years time i probably wouldnt keep swimming i will give myself two years and then another two years hopefully
7486903 its been an amazing rollercoaster ride thats for sure she said
7486904 i think thats just reflective of it being the olympics i guess i dont think anything has really fully sunk in yet i dont think that will really happen till we get home and i can see my family and my friends and just see the effect that the olympics has on the australian public
7486905 being a competitive spirit there is always going to be thoughts of how can i do things better next time thats been the case with this
7486906 in all of my races there is something that i can do better and learn for next time i think if i lose that if i dont think i can do any better that is the time when i should give the sport away because there is nothing else to do

7486974 that puts him in a terrible bind because you cant give a ringing endorsement when youre talking about foreign policy
7486975 obviously the hard thing to talk about with obama is commander in chief of all his many talents
7486976 japanese soldiers in the south pacific still fighting after the war is over
7486977 the delegates have spoken it is obvious that they want a candidate other than barack obama at the top of the ticket and i am humbled and grateful that they voted for me but if i accept the nomination i realize it will further divide the party and i will not be a party to that
7486978 so i am releasing my delegates to vote as they wish but it is my wish that my supporters vote to nominate a unity candidate whose nomination will be welcomed by all democrats and that candidate is al gore
7486979 it is true what you said once a player always a player
7486980 this is a great joy for our mothers and our people but it remains a small step because we left behind us thousands of prisoners
7486981 its not easy to release prisoners especially prisoners that were involved directly in terrorist acts against innocent civilians
7486982 running against john mccains policies in 2008 is like running against bourbon at a temperance convention
7486983 sometimes your friends are dead wrong and on the big issues this november john mccain is as dead wrong as you can be joe biden thinks the war in iraq has been a huge mistake while john mccain would do it all over again
7486984 to his credit john repudiates some of the bush administrations approach to the world
7486985 he recognizes that the power of our example is as important as the example of our power that allies we respect not disdain can advance our interests he is especially eloquent about his abhorrence for war as john is uniquely placed to be
7486986 john mccain and joe biden said send more troops we need more troops
7486987 was going to start to listen to john mccain instead of the secretary of defense because they have totally different no i shouldnt say totally many have very different views of how to proceed
7486988 i believe that there is no separation between george bush and john mccain when it comes to our middle east policy and i think their policy has failed
7486989 i dont care what john mccain says he is not going to push that agenda hard
7486990 would not be happening without leadership from both parties over the years senator mccain joined senator lieberman in introducing the first senate cap and trade legislation
7486991 i believe if neither he nor i were senators and i picked up a phone and called him and said i need you to show up at such and such a place i cant tell you why he would be there
7486992 would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off be well off no matter who
7486993 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7486994 let he who is without sin cast the first stone
7486995 its been well chronicled a thousand times john kerry asked if i would consider being his running mate
7486996 left her 4 inches shorter and on crutches and she had gained a good deal of weight
7486997 this election year the choice is clear one man stands ready to deliver change we desperately need a man im proud to call my friend a man who will be the next president of the united states barack amer ica
7486998 will count the hours minutes and seconds until bidens next slip up on the campaign trail
7486999 so let me introduce to you the next president the next vice president of the u s of america joe biden
7487000 you know how to make yoghurt but you dont know anything about football
7487001 to offset the tax increases that otherwise occur inexorably each year as incomes rise with inflation lifting people into higher tax brackets
7487002 to limit personal income tax relief to one round of rate cuts and to tilt the relief toward those who earn less than 50 000 a year
7487003 raised the top income tax rate from 28 to 33 percent for married couples earning more than 78 400 a year and individuals earning more than 47 050 increased the minimum tax from 21 to 25 percent and imposed a 10 percent surcharge on taxable income for one person exceeding 1 million a year
7487004 significantly affects taxes spending debt and regulatory burdens on consumers and taxpayers
7487005 2008 is the first year when production has reached the level prior to that of s fall
7487006 distribution is now much improved as sabotage has been eliminated to a very high extent because the security situation is much better this has affected our network now most of the network is in operation
7487007 there are still some lines which were sabotaged two or three years ago and now we are trying to rebuild them power stations is actually far higher but plants are so outdated and in bad shape that they frequently shut slashing generation to less than half of the 13 000 mw of nominal capacity
7487008 we may face a very serious problem if we do not put in place
7487009 the need for energy will be much more we have millions of iraqis out if these people return to iraq this means that new projects would be needed this is a pressing need
7487010 he has authorised us to negotiate directly with companies of international standing
7487011 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7487012 ive known john for 35 years he served our country with extraordinary courage
7487013 have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7487014 joe and i have been friends for many many years and we know each other very well
7487015 like president bush sen mccain is presenting the american people with a false choice national security or civil liberties we need a president who understands that we can have both
7487016 help carry out obamas agenda of change in a broken washington
7487017 he wanted to see how the decision sat with him
7487018 after having a president for eight years who cant go beyond talking points its a good thing that biden can dig into the issues even if he occasionally goes overboard
7487019 obamas stadium address on thursday the 45th anniversary of rev martin luther king jr s i have a dream speech will result in effusive and overwhelming press coverage this coverage will be impenetrable and will undoubtedly impact the polls
7487020 the one returns this time to lead us to the road to denver
7487021 we will encourage voters to look beyond the glamour of barack obamas celebrity status to his inexperience and lack of accomplishment
7487022 even democrats in ohio are calling on senator obama to offer something more than a lofty speech ohioans are beginning to wonder if theres anything more to barack obama than his trusty teleprompter
7487023 hiding out in one of your seven houses while your surrogates launch more low road attacks is not a surprising strategy for john mccain
7487024 but given his shocking disconnect with the struggles of american families john mccain would be better served using this time to rewrite his economic plan that was authored by an adviser who thinks we are a nation of whiners and which offers nothing more than the same failed bush economic policies of the last eight years
7487025 i would not appoint anyone who did not understand that section 5 of the 14th amendment and the liberty clause of the 14th amendment provided a right to privacy
7487026 thats the question id ask them if that is answered correctly that that is the case then it answers the question which means they would support roe v wade
7487027 as a freshman democrat he was approached by all sides
7487028 he told them that while he personally opposes abortion he would not vote to overthrow the us supreme courts 1973 roe v wade decision that gave women the right to terminate a pregnancy
7487029 i dont think i have the right to impose my view on something i accept as a matter of faith on the rest of society
7487030 in my view the mexico city policy is anti democratic because it attempts to silence foreign recipients of u s funds
7487031 it is the policy of the united states to advance the cause of democracy by promoting the values which we hold dear such as freedom of speech freedom of association and freedom of the press
7487032 the mexico city policy flies in the face of these fundamental values by attempting to restrict the speech of recipients of u s funds
7487033 this is a gag rule pure and simple it restricts speech and for the life of me i cannot understand why anyone republican or democrat would support a provision that would violate the first amendment if applied to u s based organizations
7487034 of course foreign citizens and organizations do not have constitutional rights
7487035 but just because we can legally apply this restriction does not mean that it is good policy and i do not believe that it is
7487036 no one today would accept this statement from any public servant i am personally opposed to human slavery and racism but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena
7487037 likewise none of us should accept this statement from any public servant i am personally opposed to abortion but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena
7487038 our catholic institutions will not honor catholic politicians who take pro abortion legislative positions or invite them to speak at our functions or schools
7487039 while they are to be treated civilly respectfully and with gospel charity they should never be put forward as a model of a catholic in public life
7487040 in naming my colleague and friend sen joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee sen obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant
7487041 sen biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help sen obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7487042 we now have the ticket thats going to bring the change weve all been hoping for i join all of the members of the senate democratic caucus in congratulating joe biden a great friend a great democrat and now our partys nominee for vice president this campaign is going to make history
7487043 in choosing joe biden to join him on the ticket barack has struck olympic gold
7487044 i competed against biden in the 88 campaign he is a bona fide expert on the judiciary and foreign policy he is always extremely well prepared is very smart a top level debater gutsy strong and has great personal integrity
7487045 joe biden is the right partner for barack obama his many years of distinguished service to america his seasoned judgment and his vast experience in foreign policy and national security will match up well with the unique challenges of the 21st century
7487046 an obama biden ticket is a very impressive and strong team bidens selection is good news for obama and america the following comments are posted by our readers and are not necessarily the opinions of either cnsnews com or the storys author to be considered for publication comments must adhere to the at 10 21 pm august 23 2008 calling joe biden roman catholic is like calling the pope protestant there is no correlation between the two we must stop killing our babies in their mothers womb if you are catholic or christan
7487047 the new israeli threat is not the air force but rather what israeli defense minister ehud barak says about a land based operation he will carry out in lebanese territory in a few days while discussing five brigades ready to carry out this mission these brigades will be destroyed as will the plundering israel in any future war
7487048 the israeli enemys army will witness things it has never seen since the plundering entity was established from our warriors in the field
7487049 the threats and intimidations are an inner israeli necessity because as you know there are currently kadima elections and competition between transportation minister shaul mofaz foreign minister tzipi livni and the other candidates is natural
7487050 there is a leadership crisis over there in the israeli entity and everyone is trying to present himself as though he is the commander the expert and the savior
7487051 with this atmosphere the threat campaign against lebanon will increase despite this we do not take these threats lightly and regard them truthfully and determinedly any future war with lebanon will lead to repercussions different from those of the past war its outcome will be clear
7487052 most customers wont want rainforest destruction and climate change in every mouthful of cookies or crackers so our plan is to start with the most prominent brands once we get some of the top brands on our side well use the power of the pocketbook to convince the a b cs adm bunge and cargill that destroying rainforests and increasing climate change isnt smart for business or the planet
7487053 we are currently working towards having all of our company owned plantations officially rspo certified as quickly as possible in 2008
7487054 theres currently no palm oil in the world that can be proven to be sustainable
7487055 its really important for the market to step up and create demand
7487056 global production could be doubled by planting palm trees on degraded areas of borneo
7487057 the advantage is that not a tree would have to be cut
7487058 there are points in the agreement that are still pending and they cant be approved without changes in order to preserve the complete sovereignty of iraq
7487059 the leaders of the uia focussed on the security agreement between the united states and iraq in order to ensure that the deal safeguards and national interests
7487060 saya benar benar menikmatinya 100 persen pertandingan yang banyak menguras energi

7487062 the no 1 thing is frustration anxiety knots in your stomach
7487063 you know all the things that go along with the injury to the players which do not allow your team to function as it was presented on paper any of those types of things are very difficult for a coach no matter what age you are
7487064 it was a brilliant goal but i wish we would of won the game
7487065 brazil has a lot of differences because its more technical
7487066 here its more physical and theres more running but we have to adapt here and do our job
7487067 hes a player that i was after for a while
7487068 once we get everybody healthy and get a set lineup hes going to show everybody what he can do
7487069 i definitely get some butterflies going out here and playing with upperclassmen
7487070 i got to the nba finals and i thought it was pretty big for me but winning an nba championship never would compare to winning a gold medal for my country
7487071 the usa is back on top where its supposed to be
7487072 we havent won in eight years and weve been doubted
7487073 i did talk to him on the phone a short while ago and told him that he is in everyones thoughts and prayers
7487074 it was obviously the news that i did not want to hear
7487075 but after listening to the explanation and dr warrens thoughts on it i am convinced that this is the right procedure and the right way to go
7487076 the only thing i talked with michael about was his new challenge moving forward in his new assignment and he was very excited about that
7487077 obviously he loves the giants and obviously he is working for fox
7487078 right now he is relaxing and getting ready for his fox gig
7487079 i havent talked to any of the players or to kiwi or anyone this afternoon and until i do that i will just refrain from any thoughts about what might happen within our team
7487080 i think its the number one thing that brings frustration anxiety and knots in your stomach all the things that go along with the injury to the players which do not allow your team to function as it is presented on paper
7487081 those types of things are very difficult for coaches no matter what age you are
7487082 we essentially had to duplicate a lot of the infrastructure
7487083 we wanted to reach out to the best folks in the business on what wed like to see as a forward looking technology strategy on everything from how to get more people engaged to information and data security
7487084 the tac has been a way for us to pull best practices from the private and public sectors
7487085 we built a brand new network because the network in place at the pepsi center could not handle the demand
7487086 we started by building a structure in the pepsi center which is essentially a main office and went underground to feed to customers
7487087 we essentially had to duplicate a lot of the infrastructure
7487088 as an example dnccs staff will be able to move among venue locations like invesco field and the hyatt hotel at the convention center with their cisco ip phones as they relocate depending on their changing functions
7487089 we are taking all of the steps that people would expect us to take
7487090 but were not going to talk a lot about them
7487091 weve added firewalls in place and weve got equipment in place to capture any kind of attacks
7487092 the world is losing the war i think at the moment they the taliban definitely have the upper hand
7487093 the issue which is not just a bad case scenario as far as pakistan is concerned or as afghanistan is concerned but it is going to be spreading further the whole world is going to be affected by it
7487094 eighteen million democratic primary voters donated money volunteered their time and energy worked very hard and then not only supported senator clinton but voted for her
7487095 all the efforts of supporters of legitimate citizens were for nothing because obama lied and cheated his way into a fraudulent candidacy and cheated legitimately eligible natural born citizens from competing in a fair process
7487096 to avoid the obvious problems that will occur when the republican party raises these issues after obama is nominated
7487097 obamas grandmother on his fathers side half brother and half sister claim obama was born in kenya
7487098 reports reflect obamas mother went to kenya during her pregnancy however she was prevented from boarding a flight from kenya to hawaii at her late stage of pregnancy which apparently was a normal restriction to avoid births during a flight stanley ann dunham obama gave birth to obama in kenya after which she flew to hawaii and registered obamas birth
7487099 obamas mother failed to take the oath in order to regain her u s citizenship therefore obama would not have been able to regain his u s citizenship until he turned 18 years and after he took the oath of allegiance
7487100 since the oath of allegiance would have been entered in the records of the appropriate embassy legation consulate court or the attorney general if plaintiff is incorrect then obama should be able to produce in court a certified copy of the proceedings including a copy of the oath administered
7487101 obama traveled to pakistan using his indonesian passport at the time of travels to indonesia obama was 20 years old he was well aware he maintained his indonesia citizenship and failed to regain his united states citizenship even if obama maintained his united states citizenship which he failed to do he also carries citizenships in kenya and indonesia obama has divided loyalties with foreign countries thus obama carries multiple citizenships and is ineligible to run for president of the united states
7487102 if the dnc officers and or leaders had performed one ounce of due diligence we would not find ourselves in this emergency predicament one week away from making a person the nominee who has lost their citizenship
7487103 the injunctive relief must be granted because failing to do so the dncs inaction defrauds everyone who voted in the democratic primary
7487104 a certification of birth also known as a short form birth certificate the long form is drawn up by the hospital and includes additional information such as birth weight and parents hometowns
7487105 the hawaii department of healths birth record request form does not give the option to request a photocopy of your long form birth certificate but their short form has enough information to be acceptable to the state department we tried to ask the hawaii doh why they only offer the short form among other questions but they have not given a response
7487106 recently factcheck representatives got a chance to spend some time with the birth certificate and we can attest to the fact that it is real and three dimensional and resides at the obama headquarters in chicago
7487107 we couldnt get someone on the phone in hawaii to tell us whether the number represented some secret information and we erred on the side of blacking it out since then weve found out its pretty irrelevant for the outside world
7487108 potentially if you have that number you could break into the system
7487109 they responded and apparently it isnt good enough that he posted his birth certificate
7487110 they say they want it because they claim he is not a citizen of the united states its pretty ridiculous
7487111 it was like it snowed during and after the tornado
7487112 it was a strand and then it just widened and broadened at the bottom
7487113 it seemed like it was hitting right on top of a house but it may have come to the south of the house it was incredible to see

7487118 so are the opportunities for electronics makers content providers and consumers to get connected
7487119 consumers really arent driving the trend toward networked devices the device makers are
7487120 the companies are pushing this to try to build a new business to offer new services it is really a matter of getting the infrastructure in place
7487121 what this means for consumers is that some people may bring products home and discover that they cant communicate with others on their networks
7487122 we are just starting to see the first networked products roll out and a shakeout in standards is inevitable

7487128 as we turn to this weeks trading the 1 300 level remains a concern in the absence of an event on monday that pushes the spx through this century mark i would not be surprised to see additional weakness in the market due to this resistance meanwhile the 1 285 1 290 area will become an important area of support as this region is the site of former resistance and is also home to a trendline connecting the recent low one concern is that should this trendline break selling could hit the market quickly
7487129 the coupling of still too high interest rates and tight credit restrictions will continue to hamstring first time buyers but the news will smooth some investor fears particularly adventurers in the lower end of the market in areas close to cbds where rental demand remains firm
7487130 given the almost non delivery of new rental stock current scarcity of existing stock and lack of incentives to create new stock this is a lucrative almost recession proof market of the future
7487131 in spite of the downturn this market segment is still very strong by comparison the middle income rental market is showing signs of stress which is also confirmed by national property manager trafalgar which reports a growth in flat vacancies in the r4 000 to r7 000 a month range
7487132 it is unfortunate that those who have over extended have lost money but the market correction brought on by the nca and higher interest rates may just have been very necessary
7487133 renewed buyer confidence will create a calmer environment and we can expect a slow but assured upturn in the residential and commercial sectors earlier this year there was an increase in stress sales but the stabilisation of interest rates is likely to start the recovery process
7487134 aside from financial factors like interest rates and consumer prices sentiment plays a huge part in the residential property market we may be nearing the bottom of the cycle
7487135 sales during june and july were dismal to say the least
7487136 we are seeing much stricter credit granting guidelines from banks 100 percent bonds are mainly a thing of the past banks now demand deposits and transfer fees are no longer financed
7487137 this will underpin the rental market as first time home buyers will be the worst affected and will need to rent they are now required to pay a deposit of 5 10 percent and to pay the transfer and related fees and costs themselves
7487138 saving up a r50 000 to r75 000 deposit to fund these expenses can take years they will be forced to rent and will add to the buoyant rental market we believe this market still has a long way to go before it is saturated
7487139 banks mortgage finance practices are now reverting to the 1980s and 1990s where prospective buyers were required to pay substantial deposits or even to provide collateral
7487140 the market has also been badly hit by fnbs decision to reassess bond applications older than 12 months
7487141 also the access bond type business from absa is under review affecting clients and small business owners that used these facilities to store surplus funds the credit party is over and we are back to business as usual with a hangover
7487142 the south african property market is fundamentally sound the current blip will be short lived and we will be seeing a return to substantial growth in the last quarter of next year or first quarter of 2010 we also believe the 2010 soccer world cup must have some positive effect on sentiment and add to financial prosperity in the property sector especially in tourism
7487143 we really need to change the way we do business
7487144 the demand that were seeing has far exceeded even our wildest expectations
7487145 people want to catch up on events that they miss
7487146 is that they want to resee and revisit the major events they had seen on tv earlier

7487166 all my life ive been searching for a way to heal myself
7487167 i was raised to go to church to talk to god
7487168 it takes a portion of your life to overcome one thirty days is not enough
7487169 it was almost offensive to have someone say put your trust in god
7487170 i used to think do it yourself that asking god for help was like admitting vulnerability
7487171 i am learning how to rebuild my life on his time
7487172 it was life controlling issues that brought me here i deal with them differently now i deal with god rather than alcohol
7487173 i know what it feels like for your child to want something and not being able to get it
7487174 people automatically assume that if it weakens the hazards go down with it but in the case of rainfall its not a function of wind speed
7487175 when you get a storm that comes in it pushes the sand around and kind of mixes stuff up unearthing it
7487176 i wanted the wind and maybe a little rain but no one wants a hurricane today turned out just right
7487177 ive been in another place where i found some civil war relics i was hoping for more of that but this is good too
7487178 it may be a little more in other parts of the county
7487179 weve just come from church and thought wed have to rush home and get prepared instead we came for a walk were just enjoying the lovely wind the lord provided
7487180 no one wants to be stuck at home with a generator
7487181 we need something like this to recharge the soil it probably wont be a total drought buster
7487182 the water is very deep its already at everybodys door
7487183 the college fears that appropriate people may not be given it inappropriate people may be given it and the side effects may not be managed appropriately
7487184 and overall far more people will be given it which increases the risk of pregnancies especially if this is not properly screened for and then theres more abortions

7487237 we zijn nu in afwachting van de terugkoppeling van loncin en zullen verdere actie ondernemen op de ontvangen interesse van chinese autofabrikanten
7487238 ik heb daar wat betreft een tijdsverwachting geen prognose over maar een terugkoppeling zal geen maanden op zich laten wachten
7487239 loncin is een producent van motoren en auto onderdelen geely en great wall zijn beiden autobouwers het zijn dus potenti le klanten in beginsel kan dat natuurlijk
7487240 dat is niet het model dat voor de hand ligt

7487245 the players do get what i want them to do but i just wish we were more accurate in our finishing
7487246 we are just too late here and there in what we are doing and with the odd pass going astray
7487247 we are talking about getting players to change the way they play after a style they have grown used to over the last four years the players are with me on this i believe that
7487248 some of the guys are flat and probably need to be rested this week but we cant give them that luxury just yet because injuries could force us into unenforced changes
7487249 yes we believe in what the coach wants us to do
7487250 we worked hard during the week on what we wanted to do but our execution was not there i can safely say that we gave everything we are a proud team and were determined not to lose two consecutive home games
7487251 there was an improvement from the new zealand game and that allowed us to play better there were occasions when our body positions could have been better but on the whole it went better
7487252 the nation has a right to be unhappy we are a proud rugby country and we want to be winners every week the message i want to give is that no springbok team will go out to lose on purpose
7487253 i believe we are on the right track the players will get used to it and it will go better when we stop playing as individuals
7487254 as i said some of the guys are weary but for the sake of their country we might have to play them into the ground this week
7487255 it is nicer to win but i handle my job the same win or lose i will continue as i did last week nothing is going to change this week except maybe some one on one interviews with players to get the honesty back into their game

7487279 eliminating the tax breaks is not going to keep jobs here in america weve got to make it more attractive to have jobs here in america and for corporations to be here
7487280 we should go to school longer we should have a minimum 16 years of education we should be focusing on the socioeconomic disadvantaged mostly minorities in inner cities thats something weve ignored we pay no attention to it we pretend theyre the same circumstances as every other kid in america they start off with half half of the education gap exists before they set foot in the first classroom that should be the focus
7487281 the idea that 12 years of public education is sufficient in the 21st century is ridiculous
7487282 pay those people who perform in undergraduate school give them the alternative to be able to go theyd get the same pay as an engineer gets to go in and work as a math teacher or as a science teacher so you start performance based pay by in fact paying the best performing students who want to teach and give them a chance
7487283 we should remind everybody that the day before a black child a minority child steps into the classroom half the achievement gap already exists the moment they walk into that school they are already behind
7487284 and that gap widens and it widens because we do not start school earlier we do not give single mothers in disadvantaged homes the opportunities that they need in order to know what to do to prepare their children

7487300 i think there is a good reason to do this today i see good prospects of reaching a settlement
7487301 thank god during all these years we had enough brains and reserve not to allow a similar deterioration of situation
7487302 frozen conflicts are a real volcano which can blow up anytime

7487323 i think he definitely didnt have his best day against me but playing him nine times i guess hes bound to have one off day out of all of them because there are times when i felt like there was nothing i could do
7487324 the goal is still the same and the pressure is still the same
7487325 the goal is to continue to improve my tennis and to continue playing a very good tournament
7487326 rafa will now feel what i had to feel for a very long time
7487327 so it will be interesting to see how he handles it but so far hes been great and hes played so well on all surfaces now maybe its nice to go into a grand slam for a change not having no 1 next to me and it should be interesting
7487328 i think its tough to play perfect for five years in a row
7487329 i think one big result and its turned around for him i know pretty much every player except for one that would take his bad year so i think you have to use a little bit of perspective hes created a monster for himself

7487408 but i just need to grow up so i do
7487409 at the end of the day it is still a bronze and i feel great now ive got the medal around my neck
7487410 i sat down and thought about it after i lost and just realised that i would never be no 1 over here anyway because there was no way i was going to beat zou shiming so a silver medal became a bronze
7487411 as soon as i got out of the ring there was a camera and a microphone stuck in my face
7487412 some people back home probably do understand but others jump at the chance to ridicule you
7487413 yes it was my proudest moment yet but hopefully this is not the last proud moment hopefully there will be a prouder moment when i get the gold
7487414 i am going to stay at 48 kilos and hopefully zou shiming retires and gives me a chance
7487415 despite the handlers best efforts there are always moments of political nakedness during a campaign when the voters see the candidates as they really are those moments can determine the outcome
7487416 in four or five years ulster rugby as a professional outfit will face a massive crisis unless it gets a new stadium
7487417 if we cant compete with other clubs in terms of facilities there is no point forking out money to be at the bottom of the pile
7487418 if we can get ravenhill up to the level we require it along with a national stadium then i think that is the ideal scenario
7487419 ravenhill will also been spiritual home and the majority of our games will be played there
7487420 but we do need a national stadium to generate the income from sponsors and the business community and get the supporters in for the very big games we need to have more than 13 000 people coming
7487421 i think purely from a rugby point of view we realise that there is a necessity there to have a stadium that ticks all the boxes in terms of what weve talked about
7487422 realistically rugbys need is for a stadium of around 20 000 to 25 000 but you could have a stadium that could cater for bigger crowds for different sporting events
7487423 i have no doubt that if we can get the success we are hoping for and get a stadium that is great to come to and provides all the modern luxuries that you associate with going to all the top stadia now that we will able to attract big crowds
7487424 with the way the game is going money is the driving force we have to generate the cash to bring in the best players
7487425 we want to see players who have played international rugby at the top level but to do that everything has to be in place in terms of facilities and you have to be able to pay them
7487426 and salaries at the minute are going up and up and up as the demand for top quality players rises
7487427 looking forward to next year hopefully more businesses will have the confidence to open
7487428 theres no doubt about it the august parade day is never going to be a normal days trading for businesses but we in the chamber would encourage more businesses to remain open we need to maximise the opportunities and minimise the negative impact
7487429 inheritance tax is a voluntary tax paid by those who distrust their heirs more than they dislike the inland revenue
7487430 definitely definitely without a doubt the best light heavyweight on the planet you can put that in big bold writing
7487431 the whole arse has fallen out of it the olympic experience now to be honest with you i know an olympic silver medal is brilliant but i really thought i had the beatings of that guy
7487432 still olympic silver medalists are very rare im proud to be irish and proud to have that silver i knew it was going to be hard to win if it was any way close he won his previous fight on countback hes olympic champion im not thats it thats sport im sick as a pig but thats how things go
7487433 he threw a few shots that hit my elbow and i could hear the chinese going bananas so i obviously knew he was getting a score after that i knew myself it was going to be a hard fight its ridiculous hes throwing slaps hitting elbows and getting scores from them
7487434 there were definitely five or six shots not given to kenny a blind man could see them
7487435 im just gutted for him for all of us really
7487436 its been a great games for us all two bronze medals and a silver but we want to be the best and kenny egan is the best man in these games he just doesnt have the medal to prove it
7487437 i knew then it was going to be an uphill battle
7487438 i was creasing him with body shots but he was getting the scores i wasnt what can i do
7487439 all i can do is get in there and just box give a performance theres five judges out there and thats something i actually cant control in the last i was chasing the fight i rushed it a little bit i had to i was behind i wasnt going to stand back and let the clock tick away
7487440 the computer is only as good as the people pressing the buttons and we dont have the best referees and judges here we have a divide because politically they want to keep every continent happy
7487441 we had a fella here sent home after the first day who was sent home from the world championships too and they send him to an olympic games how is he fit to judge here
7487442 i love the amateur game thats what im all about who knows in four years time i could still be captain
7487443 i told him i love you to bits said billy
7487444 the lord the lord the compassionate and gracious god slow to anger abounding in love and faithfulness
7487445 that which is lost is a piece of silver the soul is silver
7487446 god loves us not because of who we are but because of who he is
7487447 i remember two things that i am a great sinner and that christ is a great savior
7487448 we forget that god is a specialist he is well able to work our failures into his plans

7487492 by directive of the holy father in accord with the congregation for the doctrine of the faith this congregation deems it convenient to communicate to the bishops conferences as regards the translation and the pronunciation in a liturgical setting of the divine name signified in the sacred tetragrammaton
7487493 as an expression of the infinite greatness and majesty of god it was held to be unpronounceable and hence was replaced during the reading of sacred scripture by means of the use of an alternate name adonai which means lord
7487494 avoiding pronouncing the tetragrammaton of the name of god on the part of the church has therefore its own grounds
7487495 apart from a motive of a purely philological order there is also that of remaining faithful to the churchs tradition from the beginning that the sacred tetragrammaton was never pronounced in the christian context nor translated into any of the languages into which the bible was translated
7487496 ask them to try to come up with alternate language

7487574 it was definitely a help it was probably good timing hes only five and seemed to improve from cheltenham to punchestown so id be hoping he can keep improving
7487575 hes definitely a contender for the champion hurdle in march as he only has a few lengths to find from last year
7487576 theres jack the giant as well he looks progressive and barbers shop who was second in the jewson chase to look forward to

7487590 all this stuff terry has been getting at home all this bulls t is not nice
7487591 hes like a dad to all the team and he doesnt need all this in his life
7487592 hes produced three medals in these olympics and we havent had that for years whats happening is pathetic because he must be doing something right
7487593 weve all got respect for him if they brought in somebody else we would probably take the p ss out of him
7487594 its hard to say no to a million pounds but if they come to me with a sensible offer and terry is ok well that could be me signing for four years and going into the next olympics
7487595 i could be a little superstar in amateur boxing and i could earn some decent dough winning another gold medal in 2012 in my home city imagine that and to be the face of the london olympics would be unbelievable
7487596 deep in my heart i think london 2012 thats me if terry stays thats me i think he could keep four or five of us from the beijing team
7487597 earlier this month i said that beijing would be me finished but now im thinking right ok im going to 2012
7487598 if they want to sack me then they will have to sack me i shall face the music when i go back and answer all the allegations
7487599 but one things for certain if i were to go forward for the next four years i wouldnt put up with the crap that ive suffered in the last four years thats for sure
7487600 there was a time when i said i dont need this and that maybe i should spend more time at home which is something my wife deserves

7487648 ning n proyecto de inversi n podr pretender hacerse rentable a costa del medio ambiente incorporaremos el ordenamiento territorial y el manejo integrado de cuencas como eje de nuestra nueva pol tica
7487649 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
7487650 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
7487651 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
7487652 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
7487653 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7487654 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7487655 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7487656 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7487657 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
7487658 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7487659 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7487660 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7487661 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7487662 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7487663 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7487664 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7487665 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7487666 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7487667 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7487668 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7487669 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

7487673 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
7487674 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas

7487676 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables

7487682 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
7487683 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
7487684 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
7487685 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo

7487687 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras

7487700 however if the bullying occurs outside of school the situation is more complicated since the evolution of face to face bullying to cyber bullying tests the limits of whether a public school can institute discipline for acts primarily speech that occur away from school via the internet
7487701 unfortunately the courts have not spoken with one voice on the issue of cyber speech or cyber bullying
7487702 the problem with the approach that web speech created at home can if accessed at school become school speech that can be regulated is the very nature of the internet once something is created and placed on the internet the author loses control over who can access the speech and where it can be accessed
7487703 bullying and cyber bullying require a schoolwide approach educators are the architects and builders of their school culture policies are essential but they alone are not sufficient it is the adults in the school and the parents and guardians at home that create the climate that can combat all forms of bullying

7487727 as a child i used to ski ever year in scotland and now its very rare to get enough snow coverage to ski at all
7487728 the resounding advice is to get on with it in your own life and get your own house in order

7487735 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas
7487736 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
7487737 hemos debido salir varias veces de nuestras casas junto a nuestras familias y ni os ya que en los allanamientos la polic a act a violentamente y nos golpean injustificadamente sin respetar a nadie
7487738 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
7487739 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
7487740 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

7487747 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
7487748 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain
7487749 the number of clinton democrats who say they would vote for mccain has gone up 11 points since june enough to account for most although not all of the support mccain has gained in that time
7487750 theres so much that we dont know about this poll like were clinton backers even distinguished in july since they only tell us about their june opinions
7487751 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride

7487753 i couldnt believe that my paul gained an incredible 3 inches in just 2 short months now that hes longer and also thicker making love is so much more pleasurable and i come a lot more easily
7487754 and love the gain 3 02 inches meauring to 2 decimal places is amazing but hell i wouldent want that gain i would be forever treading on the thing
7487755 i couldnt believe that my paul gained an incredible 3 inches in just 2 short months now that hes longer and also thicker making love is so much more pleasurable and i come a lot more easily
7487756 do you know why chelsea clinton is so ugly because janet reno is her father
7487757 the irony is the only people mccain can count on to vote for him are the very republicans he despises at least those of us who can get drunk enough on election day to pull the lever for him
7487758 the thought of mccain being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
7487759 senator mccain is noted for three major pieces of legislation i think all of them were badly flawed and evidence a lack of understanding of our economy the very lack of understanding which senator mccain has admitted on numerous occasions
7487760 i still believe its an advantage if you know how to win a us open
7487761 you dont ever know when youre going to see the beginning of the end
7487762 when you lose a little bit of that swagger guys in any sport pick up on that
7487763 you work for years to built that invincibility knowing that at some point its going to break the mirror is going to break
7487764 ive enjoyed it talking about it being compared with the greatest
7487765 its a nice challenge beating the next generation trying to play for a long time trying to stay healthy trying to beat records its always been difficult to beat all these guys its just not so easy to keep it up all the time eventually sometimes they get you
7487766 i think thats maybe what i feel most this year you know just losing too many matches
7487767 im looking forward to the us open i still have really this and then the masters cup in shanghai to really do well now try to save my season
7487768 rafa will now feel what i had to feel for a very long time
7487769 so it will be interesting to see how he handles it but so far hes been great and hes played so well on all surfaces now maybe its nice to go into a grand slam for a change not having no 1 next to me it should be interesting

7487776 among his many memories of those dreadful times was a story that during bombing raids over ipswich when german bombers were dropping incendiary bombs and while others were diving for cover behind sand bags and nissan huts my dad would be patrolling ipswich dockside actually kicking the incendiary bombs into the water
7487777 he often modestly joked he was practising his football skills to get a trial for his beloved ipswich town
7487778 my mother and i are now living with an irreplaceable loss but i also feel an immense amount of gratitude toward my father and mother for everything they have done for me

7487780 to be or not to be that is the question whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them
7487781 the research findings suggest that viewers donated because they felt an obligation to do so people expect self or social censure if they dont help when they feel empathy for a person or organization they care about
7487782 failing to help under these conditions often leads to shame which is a powerful negative emotion that is experienced when there is an inconsistency between a persons actual and desired self
7487783 paradoxically it is by helping others that we derive self benefits in the form of enhanced self esteem and social approval serving others connotes valued human traits including compassion cooperativeness and kindness
7487784 an empathy helping perspective on consumers responses to fundraising appeals
7487785 the sympathy inherent to a close relationship with a victim extends to other victims leading benefactors to prefer charities that help those suffering from the misfortunes that have affected their friends and loved ones
7487786 so friendship with a victim does not simply make people more sympathetic rather it directs their sympathy to others with the same misfortune as their friend or loved one
7487787 if as our results show a relationship created in the lab in a few minutes can significantly increase giving then surely a charity can inspire a connection between a victim and a benefactor through its solicitations
7487788 with the administration predicting a record 482 billion deficit for next year president bush and congress should be vigorously pursuing waste and corruption wherever they are likely to be found
7487789 simply assuming honesty on the part of the sellers of this equipment is an obvious invitation to further fraud
7487790 need to start asking medicare officials some hard questions about their operations and their odd notions of auditing
7487791 the country is way too far in debt to keep throwing money at crooks
7487792 publics trust in the program has been repeatedly tested by reports of waste and fraud
7487793 congressional committees will need to sort out how much of this problem is sloppy documentation and how much reflects payment for medical services that should never have been provided and often werent
7487794 congress must also recognize its own failure to give medicare an important tool to combat fraud and waste
7487795 new competitive bidding program for durable medical equipment that would require a more intense look at the qualifications and integrity of the suppliers
7487796 with medicare expenditures soaring there is no room for any more waste fraud or complacency
7487797 really wanted to select one of them or whether they were doing so to make him appear open minded or both
7487798 would undoubtedly appreciate a more traditional pick of someone with a conservative record
7487799 has long attracted with his so called maverick reputation and whose vote could be crucial come november
7487800 the majority of republicans believe the party platform on abortion needs to change and demonstrates that a socially moderate vice presidential running mate would make the gop ticket more electable
7487801 every time he tries to reach out to them he gets smacked upside the head by his base
7487802 needs to keep his base happy and the rest of us in the dark
7487803 want to return to an america in which abortion is almost always illegal and if they knew mccains true views on the subject most would not vote for him
7487804 banking on his reputation as an independent maverick to snooker voters into thinking that his abortion views are centrist
7487805 wants to do away with our right to choose in all but the most dramatic of circumstances
7487806 will be a defining factor in his selections for the supreme court
7487807 obama draws also on the theologian reinhold niebuhr who crafted the concept of the just war and argued for the morality under certain circumstances of nuclear armament
7487808 the population of the country is aging and people now live with chronic diseases longer so its important to understand from a health perspective how people are being treated as they age
7487809 we suggest that public health campaigns will be more successful if they attend to how behaviors act as markers or signals of identity
7487810 decisions are not only based on risks and benefits but also the identity that a given choice communicates to others consequently shifting perceptions of the identity associated with a risky behavior can help make better health a reality
7487811 shifting signals to help health using identity signaling to reduce risky health behaviors
7487812 we suggest that peoples willingness to take psychological enhancements will largely depend on beliefs about whether those enhancements will alter characteristics considered fundamental to self identity
7487813 together this research converges to highlight the importance of identity expression and preservation in governing the choices and lives of consumers
7487814 preferences for enhancement pharmaceuticals the reluctance to enhance fundamental traits
7487815 our whole genome analysis supports placing the placozoans after the sponge lineage branched from other animals
7487816 trichoplax has had just as much time to evolve as humans but because of its morphological simplicity it is tempting to think of it as a surrogate for an early animal
7487817 the latest and most complex analysis again suggests that placozoans populated the oceans long before sponges evolved
7487818 the outcome of the trichoplax adhaerens genome sequencing is so exciting that we are now culturing another 13 placozoan species in order to identify the most basal placozoan lineage and genome
7487819 trichoplax is an ancient lineage a good representation of the ancestral genome that is shedding light of the kinds of genes the structures of genes and even how these genes were arranged on the genome in the common ancestor 600 million years ago
7487820 it has retained a lot of primitive features relative to other living animals
7487821 it lacks a nervous system but it still is able to respond to environmental stimuli
7487822 it has genes such as ion channels and receptors that we associate with neuronal functions but no neurons have ever been reported
7487823 some of our new placozoan species show frequent sexual reproduction while others never show any signs of sex
7487824 the genome data allow us to search for the genes responsible for sex and life cycle complexity
7487825 its remarkable that we have the whole genome sequence but we still know so little about this animal in the wild
7487826 hopefully the genome sequence will stimulate more studies of this enigmatic creature
7487827 most people with allergies are atopic meaning they have a genetic tendency to develop allergies to detect the genetic factors we examined the genomes of more than 10 000 adults and children from the whole of germany

7487837 our study shows that if you have a dense rigid matrix the cells will be more aggressive and invasive its a direct effect
7487838 if you have enough invadopodia over time theyll make large holes that cells can move through to invade and metastasize
7487839 we thought that more stuff for the cells to get through was going to make it harder so we expected to see less matrix degradation but instead we found this interesting effect where cells actually sense the rigidity and degrade more
7487840 the idea that tissue rigidity leads to a more aggressive phenotype had been out there for a while
7487841 but it hadnt actually been tied to matrix degradation which is thought to be important for metastasis and spread of cells through the body
7487842 the combination of temozolomide using the dose intense schedule and thalidomide at 100 200 mg day is a safe regimen leading to clinical efficacy in patients with brain metastases from malignant melanoma most importantly it seems that patients who develop lymphopenia during therapy have a higher chance of obtaining objective response the potential immunologic mechanism behind this will be the subject of future investigations focusing on the potential benefit of regulatory t cell down regulation the correlation between lymphopenia and objective response needs further investigation
7487843 from societys perspective covering the uninsured is still a good investment failure to act in the near term will only make it more expensive to cover the uninsured in the future while adding to the amount of lost productivity from not insuring all americans
7487844 the uninsured receive a lot less care than the insured and they pay a greater percentage of it out of pocket contrary to popular myth they are not all free riders
7487845 the incident that triggered this intervention is a real tragedy it follows that the trust should continue to do everything possible to ensure it does not happen again
7487846 we are satisfied that lessons have been learned and the trust is addressing the main concerns by making changes to its systems to reduce the risk of an incident like this being repeated
7487847 it may be too early to see the full impact of some of the improvements that have been made but the trust must maintain pressure to further drive down their response times
7487848 while john mccain is a great man and a true hero he has built a very pronounced and consistent record on agriculture and ethanol during his twenty two years as a u s senator and it is perhaps the single most negative record of any senator when compared to senator obama who supports the expansion of renewable energy such as advanced ethanol biodiesel and wind generated electricity our decision was obvious

7487856 is it logical or even acceptable that agricultural crops are used to produce ethanol leading to a worse crisis in food prices
7487857 i dont think any economist really believes that all of this rise in food prices is because of ethanol

7487877 n o nem pelos pontos que n s perdemos mas pelo que pode acontecer n s tomamos dois gols de cabe a da portuguesa mas t nhamos feito quatro antes se o placar n o estivesse favor vel seria mais dif cil correr atr s
7487878 um time que quer ser campe o n o pode errar tanto assim e eu n o estou falando de zagueiros ou de laterais todo mundo errou a marca o come a na frente e muitas vezes a gente acaba tomando gols porque errou no ataque precisamos melhorar o nosso aproveitamento e trabalhar as bolas paradas vamos tentar aproveitar essa semana sem jogos para isso
7487879 n s temos jogadores de qualidade e o posicionamento sempre muito trabalhado temos treinado demais para consertar esses erros mas eles t m acontecido claro que n o estamos satisfeitos mas muito complicado e n o temos conseguido reagir

7487904 however if the bullying occurs outside of school the situation is more complicated since the evolution of face to face bullying to cyber bullying tests the limits of whether a public school can institute discipline for acts primarily speech that occur away from school via the internet
7487905 unfortunately the courts have not spoken with one voice on the issue of cyber speech or cyber bullying
7487906 the problem with the approach that web speech created at home can if accessed at school become school speech that can be regulated is the very nature of the internet once something is created and placed on the internet the author loses control over who can access the speech and where it can be accessed
7487907 bullying and cyber bullying require a schoolwide approach educators are the architects and builders of their school culture policies are essential but they alone are not sufficient it is the adults in the school and the parents and guardians at home that create the climate that can combat all forms of bullying

7487959 i have now completed over one hundred esophyx procedures on adults with great results
7487960 with the decline of nissen fundoplications there needs to be a better option for patients suffering with gerd a degenerative disease esophyx enables surgeons to treat this disease earlier in its progression there is no reason we cant do the same procedure on a child with a mature esophagus my patient was already on a triple dose of ppis at 10 years of age and his parents were worried about the long term effects ppis will have on a healthy active boy
7487961 the increasing number of children and teenagers with gerd is a serious concern for parents the medical community society and first and foremost for the children and teenagers themselves currently their only options are fairly significant lifestyle changes lifelong pharmaceutical treatments and in some cases a surgical procedure all of which are very challenging for both the children and their parents the esophyx tif procedure might be an ideal solution for some of these patients since it provides a long lasting restoration of the normal anatomic sphincter allowing kids to get completely off of pharmaceuticals and can be fine tuned periodically throughout the life of the patient it is the first of a new wave of incisionless natural orifice surgical procedures added to the surgeons armamentarium our surgeons at both stanford hospital and at lucile packard childrens hospital and will be starting both an adult and a pediatric program using this new technology in the very near future
7487962 endogastric solutions is very proud to have played a key role in providing a solution to what was becoming a devastating problem for this boy and his family
7487963 gerd is a serious disease with serious consequences if not treated effectively egs is working with both munroe medical center and stanford to offer the esophyx and tif2 procedures to an increasingly diverse patient population including children and adolescents

7487995 we registered the hari puttar title in 2005 and it is unfortunate that warner bros has chosen to file a case so close to our films release in my opinion i dont think our title has any similarity or links with harry potter

7488059 were way way behind in our infrastructure investment both in the private sector and publicly
7488060 and we need to move a lot on that or we will see other countries supplant us as they get greater investment in their infrastructure
7488061 two or three dollars a ton is the difference between getting a contract or not
7488062 very likely we could see some resistance going forward and see another leg down
7488063 investors are likely to shy away from bank stocks in fear of further real estate and construction firm collapses from mid september so bank shares are likely to remain subdued in the near term
7488064 i felt i kind of got out well but when i turned the bend i just felt like i had nothing thats my slowest time all season right now i feel wrecked
7488065 theres absolutely no doubt about it but irelands success in boxing at these olympics are as a direct result of the support and funding thats been given to the sport over the past number of years
7488066 the introduction of a high performance programme and an increase in funding has paid dividends
7488067 the medals are great but thats not the only story
7488068 boxing clubs have noticed an increase in membership as a result of the initiative this is a tangible example of sport doing good for the community and by the nature of boxings traditional support base this is helping some of the most disadvantaged people in society
7488069 either the talent just isnt there or the talent isnt being brought out that should be brought out
7488070 there are a lot of good people out there they are not getting the results that they should be getting
7488071 everything is measurable in some form or fashion and we must take a good solid measurement on this or otherwise well be doing this interview post london post 2016 post 2010 if something isnt done hard decisions have to be made no one wants disappointment no one wants to be coming in last no one wants to be straggling behind
7488072 i want to stress that the sports council is not afraid to set targets but our remit is not just about the elite end of sport but the wider grassroots picture
7488073 returns in the form of medals can be achieved when funding is increased thats clear but its not an exact science
7488074 if the raw materials arent there in an athlete he or she cant be turned into a world beater irrespective of the amount of money sent their way
7488075 it also takes time to see a return on investment thats happened with the british olympic team this year where support and facilities were put in place many years ago and its going to get even better for them because they will be hosting the 2012 games so every discipline will have state of the art amenities
7488076 you know there was a velodrome planned for the original
7488077 last year the council was criticised for its funding of boxing following the world championships but a knee jerk reaction to stop the money would have been a huge mistake now thanks to paddy barnes kenny egan and darren sutherland the country sees that this investment has paid off
7488078 we have got to try and balance the books so some players have got to go out before we can get any in we have got a couple of targets we would love to bring into the club but again its down to financial reasons if we could bring them in i would take them but if we cant we are going to have to make do with what weve got and what we have is good

7488120 i never thought in a million years that i was ever going to have a problem with working and making money
7488121 it was either pay one bill or pay another or not eat or not have a roof over my head
7488122 hes had a lot of problems paying his loans back and hes spent an awful lot of time out there talking about his problems rather than trying to pay his loans back
7488123 the cases are so harsh in measuring what an undue hardship is that anybody who is working and maintaining any kind of home life has very little chance of discharging these things in bankruptcy
7488124 at the time that people graduate from school almost everybody is technically eligible for bankruptcy because they have debts that exceed their assets
7488125 why would anyone lend you money if you had the option to walk away
7488126 what wed like to see is that people who have made a good faith effort to repay their student loans but for whatever reasons have hit a hard patch or hit a difficult stretch that there be some flexibility
7488127 we were wrong terribly wrong we should not have tried to fight a guerrilla war with conventional military tactics against a foe willing to absorb enormous casualties in a country lacking the fundamental political stability necessary to conduct effective military and pacification operations it could not be done and it was not done
7488128 we will take our napalm and flame throwers out of the land that scarcely knows the use of matches we will leave you your small joys and smaller troubles
7488129 oh wow hes so hot he has a very nice body and all
7488130 he deserves salutations if he ever achieve more golds in the next olympics

7488132 i still believe its an advantage if you know how to win a u s open
7488133 i think he definitely didnt have his best day against me but playing him nine times i guess hes bound to have one off day out of all of them because there are times when i felt like there was nothing i could do
7488134 the goal is still the same and the pressure is still the same
7488135 the goal is to continue to improve my tennis and to continue playing a very good tournament
7488136 rafa will now feel what i had to feel for a very long time
7488137 so it will be interesting to see how he handles it but so far hes been great and hes played so well on all surfaces now maybe its nice to go into a grand slam for a change not having no 1 next to me and it should be interesting
7488138 i think its tough to play perfect for five years in a row
7488139 i think one big result and its turned around for him i know pretty much every player except for one that would take his bad year so i think you have to use a little bit of perspective hes created a monster for himself
7488140 thats the plan but i dont think either one of us is aiming for two
7488141 dont worry about it you girls get to do this back
7488142 well i have to go back inside now because i am a guy too

7488150 i dont think the scoreline reflected the game we missed chances but i would be even more disappointed if we were not creating the opportunities
7488151 i think we should have had nine points from our first three games we have had two good performances and one indifferent it is always going to be difficult at the start of the season especially with a new team i think we only have five players who were in last years squad
7488152 we have got to iron out all of the teething problems but once that is done we will be performing better

7488483 kyle had the fastest car on the long run all night long
7488484 he did an unbelievable job my only chance to get him was on the restarts the car was really fast on the last restart and i just got down there in the corner and got in the back of him a little bit and got by and we ended up holding on for the win
7488485 he did it at milwaukee and hes done it a few other times its just his normal fashion thats fine ive grown to know that now
7488486 to pass a guy to hit him getting into the corners chatters his very tires is what he did i tried to get him back but i thought better of it and tried to pull down and pass him back but i didnt have a good enough car to stick and denny hamlin got to his outside and he got by me and then i had to battle with him towards the end we were as clean as could be of course but just one other dude we had a problem with
7488487 a real smart racer explained it to me this way after he wrecked me and i was really mad
7488488 he said i just had to look at your rear bumper and decide would you do this to me and you had before so it was a real simple decision
7488489 earlier this year we had a nationwide race and kyle was a lot faster than me and he went ahead and got to my back bumper of my car and sent me up the racetrack
7488490 so thats the way it went and thats the decision i made and id do it again
7488491 all i knew is i had to try to protect the bottom
7488492 terry got into me back in three and four and i was just going to get back to him i was just going to rattle him i wasnt going to wreck him but i got to him and i turned him around didnt really mean to turn him around did mean to rattle his cage a little
7488493 i couldnt get by him and i couldnt get by him
7488494 i just kind of ran into him i just had to ask myself would he do that do me and he has before thats the way it goes
7488495 they keep talking about rivalries we may have one now
7488496 its too bad we tore up the car a little bit after the race but i guess he wasnt happy about it and i can understand
7488497 but in the back of my mind all i could think about was richmond in a nationwide race when he was trying to get through the field and he pile drove me
7488498 thats just the way it is its just racing i have a lot of respect for the guy and he was real fast but we cant give up points when theyre right there for us to take
7488499 he hit me getting into turn 1 which got me a little loose
7488500 hell probably say he was sorry and he didnt want to race that way he always does whatever well race him that way in the chase if thats the way he wants to
7488501 thats fine i know that now i tried to get him back but i thought better of it i just didnt have good enough of a car to do it
7488502 just unfortunate the way things came down at the end and well take it and well go on here these next couple of weeks and try to get ourselves a win and in the chase and throughout the chase

7488872 as an example of the team atmosphere he said to me im very sorry im very sorry and it was not his fault it just shows how ferrari people are the passion that they have the way they behave and the professionalism that they put in every day we need to be very proud of the guys who work in this team
7488873 the system works in the following way when the fuel nozzle is connected to the car you see that there is a red light on at a certain moment you see that there is a flashing light that is close to the red light telling the driver that he has to be ready then as soon as the nozzle comes off the light becomes green unless the guy that is controlling the pit stop position overrides it manually because there is a car in the fast lane coming through so he has to delay the car that is how the system works weve used it since last year
7488874 i dont think so to be honest when there is a red light its a red light its like the lollipop is down i dont think that we need to go towards that depth of course we need to make sure that the system is always working that is something that we have to make sure but this is another story
7488875 we are doing pit stop practice at home trying to do more simulation or some rehearsals at home but the fact that we cant do it at a race i dont think is a problem
7488876 weve received a fine for the team and not for the driver to be honest we didnt consider that as an unsafe move as you could see there was no obstruction there was no braking felipe was on the right hand side he stopped and the let him through but that was the view of the fia and we have to respect it
7488877 unfortunately like the last time in hungary for felipe there was no indication at all we saw the smoke on the main straight once again and we are now disassembling the engine to understand what is the real problem so i cannot give you an answer straight away as to what the problem was because the guys are still working on the engine but there was no warning at all

7488883 many respondents insisted that they do not need a critic to tell them what art is or how good it is most complained that i denied dale chihulys glass works the status of art and have no business doing so in todays culture people need not merely critics to tell them what art is but also artists curators art historians art dealers collectors and the viewers own education and sensibility in the consensus as to the art status of a piece or a body of work each such participant has something to contribute and each type of contribution has to be valued differently
7488884 the show started out as a necessity to fill the gallery over the summer artist michael hornyak had participated in our autumn juried show and the prize for that exhibit was winning a solo show at the i 5 gallery so i was hit with this inspiration for the 2 bill show when i found this stack of 2 bills i had gotten at my bank a year or so ago i posted the parameters for the show in my blog and a lot of people responded

7488891 they are not a regular family they are a very famous family and muslims around the world praise my family praise my father so when i came with a step like this it was impossible to think about it was crazy
7488892 but at the same time he sent me a message of love
7488893 everybody is asking him to disown me you understand if he disowns me he will give terrorists a chance to kill me
7488894 hamas they are using civilians lives they are using children they are using the suffering of people every day to achieve their goals and this is what i hate
7488895 killing others cutting hands cutting legs torturing people and asking for destruction of entire civilisations
7488896 live my life away from violence because i couldnt coexist with that situation as a christian
7488897 i was thinking what is my responsibility now to see people dying every day or to stand up and say this is wrong this is right and be strong about this so i had to make this move
7488898 i didnt come to christianity for money i came to christianity because this is the way we can live a better life
7488899 i love my people they have the right to live like any other nation on earth but at the same time i want to help them get on the right track

7489126 als president bush zich druk zou maken om elke cartoon waarin hij of zijn land belachelijk wordt gemaakt zou de derde wereld oorlog al ver achter ons liggen spotprenten over anne frank en hitler in de tweede wereldoorlog zijn ook zo te vinden op het internet ik denk dat we met zijn allen trappen in een enorme mediahype aangewakkerd door aanhangers van een geloofsovertuiging is dit nou allemaal zo belangrijk of praten we over normen en waarden de discussie over het bewust beledigen van mensen is ondertussen ver te zoeken op het moment dat er doden vallen en ambassades in vuur en vlam worden gezet lijkt deze discussie overbodig ook boycotten moslims deense producten en dinsdag waren in de gazastrook duizenden palestijnen de straat op om te protesteren is dit een goede manier om gezamenlijk tot een oplossing te komen want willen we dit op een fatsoenlijke manier oplossen zonder dat er teveel doden vallen zal er gewoon gepraat moeten worden ik en ongetwijfeld een heleboel mensen meer ben er ondertussen op de hoogte van de mening van moslims over de twaalf spotprenten die in september geplaatst zijn in de het deense blad jyllands posten de bedreigingen demonstraties vernielingen bij deense en andere diplomatieke vestigingen rellen doden en gewonden kunnen dus simpelweg achterwege gelaten worden het eindeloze betoog over de vrijheid van meningsuiting lijkt me ook in het niets te vallen opzettelijke beledigingen publiceren is iets wat je naam niet ten goede komt het is natuurlijk erg interessant om over te discussi ren maar alleen daarmee komen we er niet laten we afspraken maken voor zover dat mogelijk is en niet eindeloos het vuur laten smeulen de tijd wijst uit dat de consequenties die daarop volgen niet acceptabel zijn

7489137 nothing inspires more fear in the heart than being in the water at the ocean and seeing a fin cut trough the water what is more terrifying is if that fin starts heading towards you what is even more frightening is if that shark is an 18 foot great white right before it rams into you you may get a chanse to see its snout and face lift out the water if you stare into those cold black eyes you wille see no emotion just a black botomless pitt devoid of everything i would hate to say anuthing to make light of the scenario for some victims may have had this happen and they didnt survive but this predator of the ocean is one of lifes most efficient hunters that have been in existents for a millions of years

7489143 je moet je beseffen hoe lastig het was voor de pc sector toen de pc nog over slechts 640k beschikte op een gegeven moment zou het 512k worden en dat hebben we steeds verder gehoogd ik heb dat nooit gezegd juist het tegenovergestelde

7489149 we leven in een fantastische tijd als we erin slagen om het begin van de 21e eeuw te besteden om een manier te vinden waarop we de armen kunnen helpen op een manier waarmee bedrijven geld en erkenning krijgen dan hebben we een duurzame manier gevonden om armoede te bestrijden die taak zal nooit zijn afgerond maar een gepassioneerde poging om deze uitdaging aan te gaan zal helpen om de wereld te veranderen ik ben blij dat ik daar onderdeel van kan uitmaken

7489177 do you think there should be a gc in leipzig in 2009

7489179 the fairs and conferences in leipzig are becoming increasingly international and attract more and more visitors were pleased with this development i completely agree with the governor of the free state of saxony stanislaw tillich that we will do everything to help this new cultural sector and the gc games convention to achieve further success

7489189 obama has picked someone who is going to be very aggressive in going after mccain and who is not going to be recalcitrant about it
7489190 if i was mccain id be thinking about my own attack dog
7489191 hes going to want someone who can go toe to toe with biden
7489192 certainly biden was a big choice for obama and it does therefore force mccain to think about a big choice both in terms of debates and the potential demographic or state by state advantages in who he picks for his running mate
7489193 i had a right laugh arsing around with you today

7489211 to begin with let us take the following motto literature is love now we can continue
7489212 i can be changed by what happens to me but i refuse to be reduced by it
7489213 style is knowing who you are what you want to say and not giving a damn
7489214 perfume is like love you can never get enough of it
7489215 yesterday is history tomorrow is mystery today is a gift
7489216 no one can make you feel inferior without your consent
7489217 only two things are infinite the universe and human stupidity
7489218 we think that someone was possibly in the process of remodeling the home but no one was living here at the time of the fire
7489219 i get around a lot better than most people my age
7489220 this year our attendance was up 40 percent compared to the previous year
7489221 we had a a lot of people who came out here for the first time to see our display
7489222 my wife and i have been doing this for a long time and we really enjoy it
7489223 we own 10 of the tanks that were in the parade

7489225 my primary interest is in the stuart tanks its just something about them that i like
7489226 she is just a baby that likes to have fun and easy to be around
7489227 it was such a good experience having her in the book
7489228 we want her to spend time and play with other kids she is after all just a baby
7489229 if you sign with an agency then you are locked in with them and we dont want to tie her down to something

7489237 lets have a professionally drafted set of rules with legal backing lets establish a law to deal with this
7489238 labor had the opportunity to actually do something concrete about this and they didnt do it they did not do it
7489239 one minute it was on one minute it was off and yet we have members of a government routinely leaking cabinet information to paid lobbyists brian burke and julian grill who are then effectively selling it to private companies out there
7489240 what we need is a legislative legal basis done properly done professionally
7489241 the problem in wa politics involving brian burke is his attachment through noel crichton browne to people in the liberal party
7489242 ask colin barnett why wont he guarantee that he will ban his ministers when he gets into government from dealing with brian burke and noel crichton browne
7489243 he cant give that guarantee because the association is too strong
7489244 noel crichton browne is upper house liberal leader norman moores best friend
7489245 look what brian burke was doing via former shadow liberal minister john mcgrath all secretly and the liberal party found out about it and they didnt do anything
7489246 brian burke and noel crichton browne will be hoping i lose and that colin barnett wins because if he does theyre back in business
7489247 i think a lot of the issues that are going in wa politics now and attacks on me are because of what i did to brian burke and what i effectively have done to noel crichton browne

7489307 we need to invest in infrastructure and education but wheres the leadership

7489316 the central government is beyond the point where it is satisfied merely with a wait and see attitude now were seeing some action
7489317 fiscal measures work relatively fast while monetary policies tend to have an impact on the economy only after a time lag
7489318 government coffers me be a bit under pressure in the second half of the year
7489319 so there is no need to be drastic in macroeconomic control in the second half of the year

7489321 lets have a professionally drafted set of rules with legal backing lets establish a law to deal with this
7489322 labor had the opportunity to actually do something concrete about this and they didnt do it they did not do it
7489323 one minute it was on one minute it was off and yet we have members of a government routinely leaking cabinet information to paid lobbyists brian burke and julian grill who are then effectively selling it to private companies out there
7489324 what we need is a legislative legal basis done properly done professionally
7489325 the problem in wa politics involving brian burke is his attachment through noel crichton browne to people in the liberal party
7489326 ask colin barnett why wont he guarantee that he will ban his ministers when he gets into government from dealing with brian burke and noel crichton browne
7489327 he cant give that guarantee because the association is too strong
7489328 noel crichton browne is upper house liberal leader norman moores best friend
7489329 look what brian burke was doing via former shadow liberal minister john mcgrath all secretly and the liberal party found out about it and they didnt do anything
7489330 brian burke and noel crichton browne will be hoping i lose and that colin barnett wins because if he does theyre back in business
7489331 i think a lot of the issues that are going in wa politics now and attacks on me are because of what i did to brian burke and what i effectively have done to noel crichton browne
7489332 resach has demonstrated that vanilla species can exchange genes quite frequently across species barriers
7489333 this provides an opportunity to breed new commercial varieties of vanilla through hybridisation in the future
7489334 our dna analysis corroborates what the historical sources say namely that vanilla was a trade item brought to tahiti by french sailors in the mid 19th century the french admiral responsible for introducing vanilla to tahiti alphonse hamelin used vanilla cuttings from the philippines
7489335 the historical record tells us that vanilla which isnt native to the philippines was previously introduced to the region via the manila galleon trade from the new world and specifically from guatemala
7489336 identifies novel crop wild relatives cwrs for vanilla namely v odorata which can be used in the improvement of a new generation of vanilla cultivars

7489365 i first got the idea to do the film when i visited the plain of jars in laos in 2002
7489366 you could still see the craters from the air bombing and unexploded ordnance was everywhere then i heard about long chen and the fact that no one had got there since the war and i thought how do i visit and how do i make a film about it
7489367 i found it bizarre that at one time this was the second biggest city in laos and it was completely secret
7489368 laos was the progenitor of the way america fights wars in the 21st century
7489369 outsourcing the war to private companies gathering public support by falsifying intelligence and documents embedded journalism and automated warfare including the use of so called smart weapons all these methods were first tested in laos
7489370 the cia had just declassified a whole lot of material so that helped as well
7489371 the most important source was the guys who were over there filming with their little super 8 cameras often illegally
7489372 we destroyed a whole civilization we wiped it off the map we incinerated atomized human remains in this air war and what happened in the end we lost
7489373 after we went another uk crew tried to get there but they were caught and deported
7489374 its just an army outpost now a small village a couple of hundred people soldiers and their families
7489375 there are some places in the world that have a different energy and long chen is one of these you look down the runway and think this is the place were it all happened the planes took off from here and bombed all those people
7489376 the golden age of long chen is over it used to be the high tech oasis for spooks in laos there were allegedly more antennas there than trees now they do not even have power
7489377 there are still some groups but they are not organized they are certainly not politically or militarily organized they are remnants the children and grandchildren of those involved in the war who are scared to come out of the jungle because they have never known anything else

7489382 us corporate bond sales slowed to the lowest level in seven weeks as the extra yield investors demand to own investment grade bonds rather than government debt reached record highs borrowers raised 2 82 billion compared with 16 billion last week and 28 billion in the same time last year
7489383 a failure of us mortgage finance companies fannie mae and freddie mac could be a catastrophe for the global financial system said yu yongding a former adviser to chinas central bank
7489384 freddie mac the second largest us mortgage finance company sold five year reference notes at its highest yields over benchmarks in at least 10 years as demand from asian investors fell the 3 billion of debt was priced to yield 4 172 or 113 bps more than us treasuries of similar maturity the company last sold five year notes in may at a yield of 3 751 a spread of 69 bps
7489385 fannie mae and freddie macs success in repaying 223 billion of bonds due by the end of the quarter may determine whether they can avoid a federal bailout

7489409 the average peer to peer data packet currently travels 1 000 miles and takes 5 5 metro hops which are connections through major hubs with the new system data traveled 160 miles on average and more importantly made just 0 89 metro hops dramatically reducing web traffic on arteries between cities where bottlenecks are most likely to occur
7489410 a number that acts as a weighting factor for network routing
7489411 our results appear to demonstrate that vigabatrin induced satiety in these animals
7489412 given the growing obesity epidemic we felt that examining vigabatrins therapeutic efficacy for obesity was particularly relevant
7489413 the fact that these results occurred in genetically obese animals offers hope that this drug could potentially treat severe obesity
7489414 this would appear to be true even if the obesity results from binge eating as this disorder is characterized by eating patterns that are similar to drug taking patterns in those with cocaine dependency
7489415 ultimately we look forward to a debate between joe biden and barack obama about whether barack obama has the judgment and experience to lead

7489526 we dont try to put all the focus on one night
7489527 i dont think its fair to those kids because they all go through various things but in the same sense there were kids we expected more from and maybe there were other kids we didnt think were able to reach that level and they were able to do it tonight
7489528 i think theres a number of different scenarios we have to look at

7489542 so i ask you to work as hard for senator obama as you did for me
7489543 she has to get up and tell her supporters i trust senator obama to carry out the agenda we put forth in the primaries

7489552 i think theres got to be a strike on the leadership structure including mullah omar siraj haqqani and gulbuddin hekmatyar
7489553 as the insurgency has become more sophisticated many of the senior leaders continue to exist and they are one of the reasons the insurgency is getting better

7489566 coal will continue to play a large and indispensable role in a greenhouse gas constrained world
7489567 to offset the tax increases that otherwise occur inexorably each year as incomes rise with inflation lifting people into higher tax brackets
7489568 to limit personal income tax relief to one round of rate cuts and to tilt the relief toward those who earn less than 50 000 a year
7489569 raised the top income tax rate from 28 to 33 percent for married couples earning more than 78 400 a year and individuals earning more than 47 050 increased the minimum tax from 21 to 25 percent and imposed a 10 percent surcharge on taxable income for one person exceeding 1 million a year

7489579 the systems that generate elections and earthquakes are complex systems
7489580 they are not predictable by simple equations but after coarse graining averaging they become predictable
7489581 we didnt look at it as reagan versus carter or republicans versus democrats or liberals versus conservatives rather we looked at elections as stability versus upheavals
7489582 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
7489583 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
7489584 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
7489585 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
7489586 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together

7489625 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7489626 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7489627 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day

7489637 he let me know the world was large and that i should get to know as much of it as possible
7489638 they want to contrast the story of obama who has been through struggles that many americans are now facing with mccain who seems increasingly out of touch
7489639 filled with black rage against white people and hatred of the united states
7489640 the challenge is to avoid anything that smacks of angry black woman and get her back into the kitchen the question is whether she is willing to go along with that
7489641 she is bright and she is gifted but she also has a healthily ordinary attitude towards her family that american voters will respond to
7489642 make people aware of the kind of sacrifice barack made to give a voice to people who had all but given up hope

7489648 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7489649 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7489650 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7489651 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7489652 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
7489653 with the possible exception of al gore i cant think of someone who generates as much excitement
7489654 mccain was the same for nearly seventy years then he changed
7489655 claiming that mccain suddenly transformed into a different bad man is not plausible
7489656 launching implausible negative attacks is not the new politics weve been promised
7489657 its not just something biden is making up back during the primaries i remember talking to a lot of people about how i thought the 2000 version of mccain might have made a pretty good president but the 2008 model not so much but then the 2000 version would never have won the republican nomination which is why he moved so far to the right
7489658 i think bidens gaffes tend to be pretty superficial they dont reflect a fundamental lack of knowledge or empathy far from it so much as a certain ham fistedness in putting words together this is almost entirely forgivable and unlikely to create long term problems
7489659 i voted for the bill before i voted against it
7489660 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7489661 republican always always campaign by protraying the democratic candidate as an out of touch elitist
7489662 democrats in general and obama in particular have trouble connecting with working class voters
7489663 mccain s a graduate of annapolis i know a lot of the annapolis breed remember i m west point where i was born my father went there
7489664 so the obama campaign is going all out on the issue of mccain s multiple houses isn t that kind of stupid
7489665 a tiny portion of america is casting half an eye towards us every now and then maybe we hope

7489698 the olympics have showed chinas tremendous achievements and real openness compared to 10 years ago
7489699 although western reporters have encountered many problems the olympic openness is unprecedented
7489700 i think the pressure to open will outweigh the pressure to tighten after the games
7489701 the communist party has the power to mobilize society for the success of the olympics

7489703 there are not many gloucester players who have ever been granted a testimonial year so to follow players like andy deacon and mark cornwell with this honour means a huge amount to me

7489734 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7489735 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7489736 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7489737 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7489738 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7489739 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7489740 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7489741 every single one of those quotations came from the campaign of 1960 when the republicans attacked john fitzgerald kennedy
7489742 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7489743 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7489744 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7489745 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7489746 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7489747 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7489748 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7489749 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7489750 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7489751 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7489752 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7489753 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7489754 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7489755 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7489756 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7489757 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7489758 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7489759 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7489760 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7489761 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7489762 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7489763 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7489764 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7489765 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7489766 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7489767 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7489768 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7489769 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7489770 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7489771 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7489772 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7489773 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7489774 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7489775 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7489776 its important for him and the convention as a whole to lay out the distinctions and comparisons between himself and mccain
7489777 he needs to show that he can take off the gloves
7489778 my main goal at this convention and through my speech is to convey a sense of urgency that so many families are feeling across the country
7489779 and to present a clear choice between continuing the same economic policies and a new approach
7489780 he needs to introduce himself to voters who know him by name but not by substance
7489781 she has to get up and tell her supporters i trust senator obama to carry out the agenda we put forth in the primaries
7489782 you cant do that in this kind of political environment with a 24 7 news cycle the internet youtube there has to be an aggressive compare and contrast
7489783 this campaign presents a very stark choice to the american people
7489784 i think what youll conclude is hes sort of like us
7489785 its a unique opportunity for candidates to focus attention on themselves and their message for four nights mostly unvarnished and unimpeded
7489786 its almost like a gateway to the real show the fall campaign
7489787 the population of georgia will feel more safe from today from the russian aggression
7489788 they will feel safe not because the destroyer is here but because they will feel they are not alone facing the russian aggression
7489789 i dont think such a buildup will foster the stabilization of the atmosphere in the region
7489790 it is not clear how the pair have entered the water
7489791 mis fantasias son un fragmento de mis sue os pero no las he hecho realidad porque prefiero que sigan siendo parte de mi imaginacion y no de mis anecdotas
7489792 a cia counter terrorism official twice said that a high value prisoner or prisoners were being interrogated on the island
7489793 were probably holding around 3 000 people you know bagram air field diego garcia guant namo 16 camps throughout iraq
7489794 theyre behind bars weve got them on diego garcia in bagram air field in guant namo
7489795 we have received concurring confirmations that united states agencies have used diego garcia which is the international legal responsibility of the uk in the processing of high value detainees
7489796 he had received credible evidence from well placed sources familiar with the situation on the island that detainees were held on diego garcia between 2002 and 2003
7489797 the cia officer surprised attendees by volunteering the information apparently to demonstrate that the agency was doing its best to obtain valuable intelligence
7489798 the us may also have kept prisoners on ships within diego garcias territorial waters a contention the us has long denied
7489799 in my presence in the white house the possibility of using diego garcia for detaining high value targets was discussed
7489800 given everything that we know about the administrations approach to the law on these matters i find the report that the us did use the island for detention or interrogation entirely credible
7489801 is a violation of uk law as well as of the bi lateral agreement governing the island
7489802 a us plane with a single detainee on board refuelled at the us facility in diego garcia the detainees did not leave the plane and the us government has assured us that no us detainees have ever been held on diego garcia
7489803 neither of the two detainees carried aboard the rendition flights that refuelled at diego garcia was ever part of the cias high value terrorist interrogation program
7489804 the united states government confirmed that with the exception of two cases related to diego garcia in 2002 there have been no other instances in which us intelligence flights landed in the united kingdom our overseas territories or the crown dependencies with a detainee on board since 11 september 2001
7489805 intentionally failed to ask the right questions of the us and accepted implausible us assurances at face value
7489806 this remains a transatlantic cover up of epic proportions while the british government seems content to accept whatever nonsense it is fed by its us allies the sordid truth about diego garcias central role in the unjust rendition and detention of prisoners in the so called war on terror cannot be hidden forever
7489807 it is deplorable that previous us assurances about rendition flights have turned out to be false the failure of the united states administration to tell the truth resulted in the uk government inadvertently misleading our select committee and the house of commons we intend to examine further the extent of uk supervision of us activities on diego garcia including all flights and ships serviced from diego garcia
7489808 el proceso de identificaci n ha cogido ritmo y el cuello de botella de la investigaci n que era el an lisis del adn con los ordenadores ser llevado a cabo por los mejores especialistas de la guardia civil y de la polic a nacional
7489809 cuando nos dijeron que s lo durar a 48 horas mir bamos constantemente el reloj pensando que nos tocaba ir a reconocer a nuestro familiar ya no tenemos que hacerlo creemos que quiz s lo hicieran por una cuesti n de sensibilidad para no decir en qu estado se encontraban los cuerpos
7489810 ya son conscientes de que los cuerpos de sus familiares est n calcinados desmembrados en muchos casos y que mucha gente s lo podr llevarse una parte del cuerpo porque no hay m s
7489811 saltan de alegr a cuando se les dice que han identificado a los suyos
7489812 no es normal porque no han sobrevivido se llevan un cad ver por eso queremos salir pronto de una situaci n tan rara
7489813 la cosa est en que quieren comprar nuestro dolor y el dolor no tiene precio ya que se ofreci a ingresarnos 25 000 euros por adelantado de indemnizaci n no pueden decirnos esto cuando hay todav a cuerpos por identificar
7489814 porque o no la tiene y si la tiene no la van a decir porque no les incumbe y porque forma parte de la investigaci n como acusada
7489815 on friday thousands of hip hop fans might have felt just like the geto boys bushwick bill
7489816 wait till the cake comes out the kitchen before you eat it
7489817 it was a song that kanye and i had done first me featuring kanye
7489818 i know i got it first im christopher columbus yall just the pilgrims how it feel to wake up and be the sh and the urine nah na na trying to get that kobe number one over jordan
7489819 you can pay for school but you cant buy class
7489820 sell a lot of records i respect it and salute that but spitting real life on hot beats im the truth at when you kick it like me no exaggeration necessary
7489821 its definitely an honor man to be among the elite in the game to have as much respect from them as they have for me is also a privilege i just wanna live up to all the expectations
7489822 basically man its about the lessons ive learned in life the old me being dead and gone how ive changed how my life has taken new meaning
7489823 i still have kanyes verse so maybe well do a remix down the line
7489824 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7489825 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7489826 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7489827 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7489828 your playing on a map too big for covert ops we tard
7489829 you shouldnt have brought your gigantic boyscout camping bag to war
7489830 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7489831 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7489832 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7489833 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7489834 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7489835 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7489836 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7489837 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7489838 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7489839 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7489840 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7489841 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7489842 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7489843 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7489844 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7489845 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7489846 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7489847 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7489848 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7489849 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7489850 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7489851 i learned this shes stronger and tougher that he bill clinton is when she takes a point youre gonna have to be sure youre well informed because she will not compromise shes very bright shes strong and when she gets her dander up she aint going to roll over
7489852 im convinced he has a sexual addiction he needs to get help for his sake he has already damaged his presidency beyond repair
7489853 when truman boarded a train january 1953 at union station without a penny in federal largesse except a microscopic army pension the president knew he would have to sell some property and would even have to dip into his own pocket to buy stamps to answer the 72 000 pieces of mail he received in just the first two weeks after he left the white house
7489854 he assured me the press stories concerning the kickbacks he got in exchange for state contracts were not true he lied to me
7489855 boy is she bitter about the press if george w loses shes gonna pop off the bush press bashing didnt abate even after their boy became president
7489856 i dont know what powell is going to do but if he were to jump into the political arena as a republican he could get the nomination as vice president if not the presidential nomination and he could beat clinton easily
7489857 john mccain would be stronger against gore gore will be a dull unspiring loser candidate for the democrats mccain looks stronger he is stronger mccain because of his military service and vietnam prisoner of war hero status you know he had a hehluva military record
7489858 bush has that air reserve texas national guard record of course gores war record in vietnam aint much either
7489859 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7489860 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7489861 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7489862 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7489863 i would have to think that a bumper sticker that said obama the other edwards might have been a bit difficult
7489864 nosotros lo que pedimos es informaci n por muy triste que sea

7489874 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
7489875 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7489876 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7489877 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
7489878 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7489879 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7489880 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7489881 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
7489882 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
7489883 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
7489884 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
7489885 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
7489886 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
7489887 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
7489888 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
7489889 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
7489890 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
7489891 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
7489892 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
7489893 and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7489894 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
7489895 however nothing rallies the righties like a clinton a recent poll showed 49 of americans would never vote for hillary
7489896 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
7489897 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
7489898 the ministry of unity exercised by the bishop of rome
7489899 i found my identity as a christian by reconciling within myself the faith of my origins and the mystery of the catholic faith without breaking communion with anyone
7489900 ill treated and afflicted he never opened his mouth like a lamb led to the slaughter house like a sheep dumb before its shearers he never opened his mouth
7489901 inner reconciliation of the faith of his origins with the mystery of the catholic faith without breaking fellowship with anyone
7489902 i have found my own christian identity by reconciling within myself the faith of my origins with the mystery of the catholic faith without breaking fellowship with anyone
7489903 shut yourself in your room and pray to your father who is in that secret place
7489904 i would like to remember the great pioneer of unity bro roger schutz who was so tragically snatched from life i had known him personally for a long time and had a cordial friendship with him
7489905 he often came to visit me and as i already said in rome on the day of his assassination i received a letter from him that moved my heart because in it he underlined his adherence to my path and announced to me that he wanted to come and see me
7489906 i see good reason in this context for optimism in the fact that today a kind of network of spiritual links is developing between catholics and christians from the different churches and ecclesial communities each individual commits himself to prayer to the examination of his own life to the purification of memory to the openness of charity
7489907 the father of spiritual ecumenism paul couturier spoke in this regard of an invisible cloister which unites within its walls those souls inflamed with love for christ and his church i am convinced that if more and more people unite themselves interiorly to the lords prayer that all may be one jn 17 21 then this prayer made in the name of jesus will not go unheard
7489908 lest we be misled by a grammatical quirk in the title of the story the guidelines released by the aba are not about how to be biased but on how to eliminate bias

7489961 no this is not yet my inter my inter finishes the match at the right time they win 2 0 and not by a narrow margin
7489962 they say that it is not possible to play beautiful football here but inter and roma showed exactly the opposite four goals lots of chances and enjoyable moves
7489963 coaches are all the same they always ask for more and another winger could be useful
7489964 he would give us another option with two advanced wingers and a centre forward anyway it wont be a drama if quaresma does not arrive

7489972 2005 inventory of seattle greenhouse gas emissions community and corporate

7489977 inventories are great at making clear where the greenhouse gases are coming from

7489982 of a 42 vehicle fleet only three dont run on alternative fuels
7489983 and were looking to up the bio component of our biodiesel from b 20 20 percent plant oils to b 40
7489984 the city has been committed to sustainability for a long time
7489985 we realize that its not like seattle magically began looking at climate change in february of 2005 but the mayors climate protection initiative really gave everything a kick in the butt
7489986 were still hugely dependent on our automobiles and were the only city on the west coast without a workable mass transit system
7489987 mayors that are serious about fighting climate change dont build highways through the centers of their cities they tear em down
7489988 my mistake on the viaduct was accepting the states assertion that we had to replace the roadway that moved 110 000 vehicles through the city every day
7489989 we still need to have commerce take place in the city but now were thinking in terms of how we replace the movement of goods and people as opposed to the movement of vehicles
7489990 if the mayor wants 35 percent of the population moving from cars to buses and bikes we need to give up 35 percent of our roads to those uses giving over 2 percent of the citys department of transportation budget to paint stripes on the road wont get it done
7489991 i dont think were ready for a toll to get into downtown
7489992 mayor bloomberg in new york city is running into the same problem he needs permission from albany
7489993 we must go an order of magnitude beyond the goals of kyoto and cut our emissions 80 percent by 2050 skeptics will say that it cant be done we will show them how it can
7489994 easy for me to say that right im not going to be around in 2050 im not going to get to an 80 percent reduction but we can change the way we behave the way we live in the city this is a multigenerational partnership its going to take a long time to fix

7489998 i hope this is remembered as the time when seattle moved from a big town to a big city
7489999 you cant hate sprawl and despise density i want people to say this is when we figured out how to act as a big city the second thing is light rail i worked on it for 20 years i was attacked on the issue when i first ran for mayor it was hard heavy lifting and now were opening the first line next year
