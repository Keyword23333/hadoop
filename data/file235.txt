2350009 one of todays most contentious economic debates is whether the current system of large global imbalances can continue some researchers suggest that this system will not persist because the united states must stabilize its external debt ratios and part of that adjustment will involve a large depreciation of the dollar even more than has occurred so far others argue that global imbalances could continue for an extended period because of factors that make u s assets more attractive and the persistent return differential between u s and foreign asset holdings most researchers agree that the greatest short term vulnerability to the current system is the willingness of foreigners to continue to invest almost 2 trillion per year into the united states at existing exchange rates and interest rates over the five years from 2002 through 2006 gross capital flows into the united states totaled 6 2 trillion foreigners invested an average of over 5 billion in the united states every day despite relatively low returns compared to investments in other countries and the widespread expectation of continued dollar depreciation moreover over two thirds of u s external liabilities were held by the private sector by the end of 2006 what motivates the individual decisions that drive these capital inflows and can this massive net transfer of capital into the united states last
2350010 still foreign investors might choose to continue investing in the united states and financing the large u
2350011 moreover were it not for the poor timing of investors from developed countries who tend to shift their u s portfolios toward or away from equities prior to the subsequent under performance or strong performance of equities the returns differential would be even lower thus in the context of equity and bond portfolios we find no evidence that the u s can count on earning more on its claims than it pays on its liabilities

2350117 i dont feel real lucky i am glad i got in with a 68
2350118 i saw the pin on 13 and i knew 12 and 13 would be birdie holes

2350120 after my third birdie the next four holes were into the wind and i was just trying to make par on those holes

2350128 in singapore academic achievement has been such a powerful tool for social mobility and passport to career and material success that it is used as a key tool to identify talent
2350129 but unless we reframe our definition of talent we will always see talent as a scarce commodity and suffer a talent no enough syndrome
2350130 we need to slaughter the sacred cow of the traditional assessment system
2350131 we cant paint everyone with the same brush but today the mark of success is all the cs car cash condo credit card country card more than in the 90s
2350132 singapore is not short of talent but theres always a fight between practicality stable job income and passion theres also the fight between pursuing your own dreams and living up to parental or familial expectations
2350133 a couple of years ago prime minister lee spoke of a mountain range of excellence in order to broaden our national discourse on talent this broadening is imperative for any mature society let alone one with global aspirations
2350134 too often singaporeans fail to take risks because they are scared of failure the end result is we end up having the government trying to teach us to do things that governments are traditionally very bad at entrepreneurship art music and so on
2350135 sometimes being talented means that one has opinions that run contrary to popular belief singaporean society is not always used to embracing contrary opinions
2350136 the situation has gotten a lot better but there is still much room for improvement
2350137 we need to ask are we a place for young graduates raring to go or are we a city for middle managers with families or for senior citizens winding down maybe thinking of a second career where does singapore pitch itself
2350138 you have to look at the character of the city to see what talents it could have
2350139 it helps shape the socio political ethos with its new visions and ideas thereby driving the country towards a shared future to the man on the street singapore talent facilitates a sense of belonging and symbolises what it means to be singaporean and to live in singapore in this vein much more needs to be done to change existing mindsets that singapore talent is third rate
2350140 singaporean talents are only recognised in singapore when they are recognised internationally first
2350141 on a more practical level local budding talents find it necessary to go overseas to hone their talent be it in sports academies music observatories prestigious art and cultural institutes leaving singaporeans unaware of them western audiences get the fruits of our talent
2350142 constant promotion of foreign talent may have sidelined local talent
2350143 first that it is insufficient second there are certain areas in which singaporean talent is not yet ahead of the curve so we need foreign talent to take us into new sectors
2350144 in other words are we sophisticated enough to invest in talent purely for talents sake and not because of the rewards such an investment might bring

2350220 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2350221 he swam a fair way out he was 250m out to sea at one point and he was out there for a long time
2350222 it was very fortunate he didnt drown it was very cold
2350223 i want to get the next president and congress to make securing our border and a comprehensive immigration policy the top priority
2350224 its sort of like having the wolf guarding the henhouse
2350225 martinis are like breasts ones not enough and threes too many
2350226 i really need to talk to an african american assistant coach a guy who really should be a coach in this league to talk about the percentage of black head coaches in the league i need to talk to somebody like ted cottrell
2350227 how do i ask the question so ted will speak for a long time
2350228 why dont you put a piece of rubber at the end of your stick that ticking sound is driving me crazy
2350229 if you had put a rubber at the end of your stick wed be riding the bus so shut the hell up
2350230 ten years ago if youd have told me that an openly gay former child star would one day be hired to hawk the butchest old school mans man scent in america i would have laughed in your face and maybe called the cops on your obviously whacked out on pcp ass
2350231 why do american punkrock boys always go out with the american new wave hooker girls
2350232 more than a little afraid of the scary fucking bitch
2350233 perfectly subverts the classic heros journey familiar to every comic fan challenging us to think about the mundane world were all a part of and the hidden price of entering the hidden special world we all one day dream of joining those of you who refuse to see what the conclusion is really saying will probably want to burn this beautiful collection the second you put it down i think wanted has the bravest most interesting finale to a comic ever
2350234 tome muito cuidado minha filha n o ande sozinha por a n o chegue tarde quem quando onde o qu como
2350235 we are charging defendant kwame kilpatrick with assaulting police officers in the furtherance of their duties
2350236 he knows what the bond requirements are and yet he professes to take this case seriously
2350237 its about him not telling anyone and trying to get away with it
2350238 we can state confidently that we have managed to finally clear this hurdle in the way of implementing the comprehensive peace agreement
2350239 this was the main single outstanding element in the roadmap that was agreed after the fighting in may
2350240 it means that the donor community will be able to move in and support the return of the people and support the administration in reconstruction
2350241 russian air forces have bombed towns in georgia the port of poti on the black sea the town of senaki the russian air assault ranges from the black sea coast in the west to the azerbaijani border
2350242 if this is not an all out war what is
2350243 georgia has been attacked by a formidable force it is a brutal attack with the use of air force tanks and even the trademark cyber attack
2350244 were not going anywhere and we are going to continue to fulfil the task that we were assigned
2350245 the entire city of tskhinvali is currently controlled by units of south ossetias defence forces
2350246 georgian forces are controlling the entire territory of south ossetia except java we are fully in control of tskhinvali
2350247 the positions from which georgian troops were firing have been destroyed by fire from artillery and tank units of the 58th army
2350248 one brigade of georgian forces is in iraq and we are calling it home tomorrow
2350249 tbilisi is using a tactic of scorched earth a number of towns in south ossetia have been fully destroyed according to some reports
2350250 georgian snipers are not letting through ambulances not allowing the medical services to get on with saving people
2350251 russia is openly challenging the international community and jeopardising established international order and stability
2350252 we demand the russian federation immediately terminate aerial bombardments immediately pull out the occupying forces and negotiate ceasefire
2350253 are you ready to stop the fighter jets who are in the air who will soon be bombing my comrades in georgia and what will the security council do about this now how are we going to address this
2350254 we deplore the russian military action in georgia which is a violation of georgian sovereignty and territorial integrity
2350255 id also like to take the opportunity to reiterate calls for a ceasefire for withdrawals and we look to the georgians the russians the south ossetians and other fighters to desist from violence
2350256 we were always dangerous going forward but we had two lapses of concentration and they scored two fantastic goals
2350257 ajax were sharp and incisive and they took advantage of every mistake we made in the first half we were not right tactically we were not well positioned i am not too concerned though we played against a good attack as long as we score more than the opposition i am ok
2350258 the fun is sucked out of a major event when you set it up like this
2350259 the set up here is lousy its not enjoyable to play they have taken an ok golf course and turned it into a lot of crap thats my opinion and im sticking to it
2350260 its a strange year when the us open traditionally the toughest of the majors is the most fun of the four
2350261 the pga of america is supposed to be in the business of getting young people to play golf
2350262 but watching this event is only going to get people more interested in baseball
2350263 this is a major championship that does nothing to promote the game were i a youngster watching this in england id be taking up 20 20 cricket
2350264 it really is impossible for the players to come off the course looking anything but shell shocked
2350265 none of this makes any sense at all i mean the pga of america spend millions of dollars on advertisements then they go and make the game look ridiculous the whole thing is nothing but a struggle for all concerned
2350266 bradford were very good in that second half and we had to play well to beat them
2350267 were disappointed because we didnt come here to be brave soldiers and miss out in the end
2350268 he was our best by a mile and i thought jamie peacock was the same for them
2350269 regarding events of the past few weeks and following full and frank discussions with the club i accept that my off field behaviour has been unprofessional and have apologised
2350270 i dont expect alex to be happy if he loses ever
2350271 i saw him after that game and he swore at me but he said well done but if you beat united then youd better bloody win it
2350272 i loved going to old trafford as a player or a coach and something inside me always wanted to beat them i hope they give us a good game work us hard pass the ball and make us run because we have a tough game the week after against chelsea in the league
2350273 i was so happy when i flipped the coin yesterday because i knew the cricket was on its way
2350274 this hundred probably does mean more because of all the scrutiny of the past few days my relationship with the players has come on leaps and bounds in the past few days as i have learned a lot about how they operate you have a really different perspective you really want them to do well for you and for the team its more of a holistic kind of thing
2350275 more than me getting a hundred today i wanted steve to get fifty
2350276 he has been away from the game for six months i love him he is a great lad to see him back to see him smiling and laughing cynical little man that he is is great
2350277 there is no question of ashley behaving improperly but for us smaller clubs retaining players can be a problem and i feel that ashleys dual role gives him an unfair advantage
2350278 ashley is a person of great honesty and integrity and i have no fears that he may misuse his position there are great advantages in having a selector so actively involved in the game and ashley understands the clear distinction between his two roles
2350279 bottom line there is a threat of homegrown terror in america
2350280 it is not as great as in european cities but it is growing and we have to take it seriously
2350281 being an american gives you a passport around the world
2350282 these again are instances of homegrowns who take it to the limit these people wanted to go all the way to iraq
2350283 i am continuing to work to try to bring down the terrorist web sites on the internet
2350284 i think the critical role is reaching out to try to stop the problem in local areas before it starts
2350285 we have a first amendment and we champion the constitution and so in no way shape or form should we engage in censorship of the internet
2350286 but the community recognizes that the internet can be a dangerous tool for youth
2350287 so were working on that by giving constructive alternatives to the youth
2350288 its not a substitute for physical field training but it can come close to creating situations on how to train for an urban attack a mall attack
2350289 its somewhat like what some of the 9 11 hijackers used in flight simulation software
2350290 giving parameters as far as race religious views or age groups really misses the point we should be much more sophisticated in the way we approach threats against our country
2350291 cristiano will now settle down and enjoy his career here he has four years left on his contract and hopefully at some point we would like to extend it thats where we are
2350292 it was an important issue to keep him here there are very few players who have left me against my will and it is unusual for anybody to want to leave united
2350293 i think thats finished now when we had the meeting in portugal last month the lad quickly agreed with me hell be a great player next season because hes still improving hell be absolutely fantastic for us
2350294 the important thing is that we have ended all the stuff about real madrid and as he gets older he will appreciate being here more that happens with players the longer they stay here and they dont want to leave if you look at rio ferdinand he joined us as a young man from leeds but he has now become a real manchester united person who loves the club they come north to a colder wetter climate but they come to a real football city which not many cities can say
2350295 real know they are dealing with a different animal now
2350296 we are looking at three or four options in the striking department which we hope will come to a happy conclusion i hope something will happen before the start of the season
2350297 its kristina or krissy she says with a manner of a first grade teach corrected her student on improper grammar not kris
2350298 i swear if im late for pt im going to punch you in the throat
2350299 say it aint so knights another one of you siblings has gone out and got in trouble say it aint so
2350300 me no i dont sing i write i dont care for being behind the microphone thats rays thing i rather stay behind the scenes im just here to lend a pen every now and then
2350301 yo quit caking i need to get her in to the booth you two can talk on your dime
2350302 what im just saying you was haling ass oh i saw kristina she told me to tell you to give her a call i think shes digging you man
2350303 you can support creative commons by watching our videos including our brand new clip
2350304 its true to say that i have had a meeting with wenger and we had a very positive discussion
2350305 al bangura returned home early from the recent tour of austria for disciplinary reasons these have since been dealt with internally
2350306 al bangura remains an important part of the watford squad
2350307 the players know they will be there to be shot at and it has to be a measure of their character and their confidence and their belief and their attitude
2350308 they cant think they can play the beautiful game and soar straight back up to the premier league they have to get through the battles thats what comes with being one of the favourites but they should take it as a compliment they should get confidence from that thats why i am trying to build the team with players that can make a difference but also players with character and a bit of steel because we will need that
2350309 to be the captain of birmingham and take them back into the premier league would mean so much to me i grew up 10 minutes from the ground and i know what it means to birmingham fans it would be the sweetest moment of my career i want to get promoted and win medals and i want to stabilise the club in the premier league my family and friends are all blues fans and i want to make them all proud
2350310 we have a lot of players with premier league experience it is good that we have that and that should be a big help to us but its about application and not doing anything different just because they are in a different division theyve just got to play at the level that they are capable of
2350311 employers and individuals are vulnerable to unauthorized or bogus entities selling coverage between 2000 and 2002 the u s department of labor and state insurance regulators identified 144 unauthorized entities selling health insurance unlawfully these entities defrauded 15 000 employers and more than 200 000 policyholders out of 252 million
2350312 id hesitate to say hes a marxist but hes got some positions that are far to the left of me and i think mainstream america
2350313 i have to run my business i dont have time to be sick
2350314 i think i have gone to the doctor 2 times in the last 5 years
2350315 my insurance company keeps raising my rates and i dont even use my insurance
2350316 is this a company that i would trust to pay my health insurance claims
2350317 we have not been able to bring in barry but it is not a question of money i dont know what it is
2350318 we need to improve if we can and i think we need another player because clearly we have problems on the left i have sold john arne riise harry kewell has gone fabio aurelio is injured and sebasti n leto didnt get a work permit so we need another left sided player i cannot say now who that will be but barry can fill that position and play in others too the rules will say we need four english and four associated players and barry is english who can play in three different positions but i cannot say any more all i can say is i will try my best but i dont know too much why we havent signed barry
2350319 at the end of last season i was promised that if there was a good offer i could leave
2350320 this offer exists it comes from everton who want to buy me for more than eight million euros i want to leave rennes everton are offering me 1 5m euros a year rennes could never offer me that much everton are a very established club in the premier league managed by david moyes a coach who puts trust in youngsters i have spoken to him on the phone he wanted to invite me to visit the club i hadnt the time to do it
2350321 i like to see the players enjoying themselves and celebrating wins it gives you a kick watching them celebrate winning trophies i like coaching and being with players at the end of last season i didnt want to explain anything i just wanted to get away there was nothing sinister to it i just wanted to enjoy it on my own now we have to win again
2350322 that doesnt come into my psyche or the way i work
2350323 if you look at rangers for example they have signed 3m players from the championship
2350324 that is a bit of a gamble if i wanted a better striker than jan vennegoor of hesselink it could cost me 20m so i cant do that
2350325 if you do want to push the boat out the players you want would rather go to england italy spain or russia there is a clamber for top players but the top players are not clambering to come here
2350326 we have had no offer for carlos we do not want one are not seeking one and we dont need to sell the player or any player at this stage
2350327 we are finding a difficulty in getting a level of player that we want to bring in but there is money there for us
2350328 when tottenham made their offer i was sceptical at first
2350329 but after ramos called me personally and told me that they were selling robbie keane and that he wanted me in his side the situation changed when a coach shows an interest in you especially such a renowned and strong coach then that is already half of the success of any move i also like the way tottenham play so i agreed in principle to join
2350330 its a real shame that our men and women have been prevented from enjoying a friendly game which its sole purpose was to raise money for ex players and staff members who have financial or health difficulties
2350331 everything can be taken from a man but one thing the last of human freedoms to choose ones attitude in any given set of circumstances to choose ones own way
2350332 how the west was won and where it got us
2350333 alla fine ho dovuto rassegnarmi ripiegando su arma di taggia nulla di male anzi per quanto altre fossero le intenzioni con cui qualche ora prima ero riuscito a divincolarmi dal traffico milanese puntando verso la riviera ligure lidea era di arrivare nei pressi di triora provincia di imperia per lora di cena sistemarmi in uno degli alberghi indicatimi dalla proloco la settimana precedente e magari fare due passi tra gli angusti vicoli dellantico borgo dardesia non prima di aver gustato un bicchiere di quellormeasco che almeno quanto le streghe appartiene alla storia e alla cultura di quella che fu la ricca podesteria della repubblica di genova
2350334 dear aunt arctic i have a really good question to ask you why doesnt club penguin have cars
2350335 the gospel is central to our thinking in an experiential sense
2350336 allowing the bible to speak as a whole the one word of the one god about the one way of salvation
2350337 the process of eschatology being worked out in the history of our world
2350338 if we evangelicals are bible people then we have to be diligent in working out our understanding of the message of the bible and of its effects in the way we perceive the world and seek to live in it as gods people
2350339 it is less important for the preacher to be able to pin down the definition of genre or to tabulate all the genres of the bible than it is to be aware that literature is used in different ways for different functions
2350340 this book is a masterful look at the relationship between biblical theology and preaching and it offers preachers valuable insights into preaching christ centered sermons from all of gods word including the old testament
2350341 a preacher must be oft upon the same things because the matters of necessity are few
2350342 you shall love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind
2350343 preaching should be driven by a passion for the glory of god
2350344 the great design of a christian preacher is to restore the throne and dominion of god in the souls of men
2350345 for i decided to know nothing among you except jesus christ and him crucified
2350346 pagan the philosopher and even the jew who attempts to get a handle on reality apart from the truth that is in christ
2350347 the reason for this christ centeredness is so that the faith of his readers might not rest on human wisdom but on the power of god 1 corinthians 2 5
2350348 every sermon which aspires to be at once both biblical and practical must be derived from an honest exegesis of the text and it must constantly be kept close to the text
2350349 in the cross of christ god has undertaken to overcome both obstacles to preaching it overcomes the objective eternal obstacle of gods righteous opposition to human pride and it overcomes the subjective internal obstacle of our proud opposition to gods glory
2350350 while the temptation in preaching will be strong to proceed directly from the godly israelite to the contemporary believer there is no direct application apart from the mediation of christ
2350351 preaching is the highest and the greatest and the most glorious calling to which anyone can ever be called the most urgent need in the christian church today is true preaching and as it is the greatest and most urgent need in the church it is obviously the greatest need of the world also
2350352 if the lives of christian leaders are not modeling authenticity including an honest self awareness of their sexual sins how can what theyre preaching be good news
2350353 no man preaches his sermons well to others if he doth not first preach it to his own heart
2350354 the application in a sermon is not merely an appendage to the discussion or a subordinate part of it but is the main thing to be done
2350355 que tristes las horas que se desgranaron bajo el aletazo de la soledad
2350356 qu tristes las sombras las sombras nefastas las sombras creadas por nuestra maldad oh las cosas idas las cosas marchita las cosas celestes que as se nos van

2350361 noob prez allows convicted terrorist to be released after 5 months
2350362 but thats actually entirely incorrect all the charges relating to the missiles in the trunk of the vehicle hamdan was in when captured were rejected by the military jurors
2350363 the pentagon must be very proud of itself today it was able to obtain a conviction of arguably the least culpable among the 80 detainees it intends to prosecute as war criminals it convicted a truck driver of being guilty of driving a truck
2350364 a courageous insightful book particularly relevant for anyone who grew up feeling physically different
2350365 the singing of swans is a remarkable narrative calling even compelling us to connect with our own ancestral roots to seek our own inner wisdom and to reclaim our own inner voices
2350366 if you have ever measured your height or your weight and felt good or bad about yourself as a result you need this book in its pages ellen frankel makes an important contribution to human liberation by telling the most fabulous story that can be told the story of a person coming fully into her own this book is thought provoking heart rending and a genuine solace for people of all sizes
2350367 thomass incisive blend of sociological inquiry and personal narrative amounts to a provocative treatise on fat oppression in our culture taking up space is a kind of roadmap through the minefield of the war on obesity and it offers protection to the reader ready to fight for cultural change surrounding the meaning of fatness

2350369 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2350370 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2350371 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2350372 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2350373 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2350374 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2350375 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2350376 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2350377 the new organization capabilities in vmware lab manager 3 will help us better enforce role based access rights to system configurations in the lab according to our it policy says tony anastasio technology architect for cerner the leading u

2350380 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with sen obama than sen mccain
2350381 we may have started on two separate paths but we are on one journey now
2350382 which is why sen obama needs all of us he needs us working for him
2350383 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all
2350384 were going to have a very clear message about how the campaign will cooperate and how the convention will be conducted when its appropriate to make that announcement
2350385 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2350386 you could argue that no ones ever ready to be president i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year you could argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can ever be fully ready for the pressures of the office and that everyone learns something and something different you could argue that
2350387 you could maybe let it go without putting a plate on the side and yet were better off in the long haul making sure there is something there
2350388 otherwise i think theres going to be a little more instability if he is able to get back to playing shape where he can play those last six seven games
2350389 right now you dont have a lot of bodies out there that are experienced
2350390 thats why being able to use various personnel groups may come into play
2350391 where the incident occurred he was outside the scope of the conceal and carry law holmstrom said
2350392 the real debate seems to me a cultural and social one do we want a society in which it is an unconscious emblem of everyday life that folks move about with portable killing machines strapped to their bodies
2350393 tim mcvey was an nra life member so all life members are anarchist terrorists
2350394 the real debate seems to me a cultural and social one do we want a society in which it is an unconscious emblem of everyday life that folks move about with portable killing machines strapped to their bodies
2350395 i dont understand how she got shot in the back
2350396 they say mccain reads the blogs so here goes senator mccain dont let the campaign kibbitzers muddle things up first and foremost sarah palin shares your values she killed the bridge to nowhere need we say more as for the politics sarah palin transcends geography her constituency like yours goes beyond state lines she will get your ticket access to voters all over the country based on who she is and what she stands for because shes young a woman a mother with young kids she will grab media attention more than any other potential candidate gov palin also has a son in the active duty military you have very wisely taken your sons service in iraq off the table as a campaign talking point that is and should be respected but others can talk about it and reflect on what it means a mccain palin administration would be the first in memory which has family members in uniform during wartime from both the president and vice president that would be a powerful statement as to the importance of national service especially in uniform most importantly any vice president should be ready to step up and serve in the event she is needed frankly who is really ever ready gov palin is as ready as anybody she is a quick learner and in her public career has exhibited the courage and decisiveness needed for a great leader godspeed to you in your campaign and in making this important decision

2350403 i was away in london so i didnt catch much of what was going on until i spoke to everybody today
2350404 whether it was a real deal or not i dont know you need to talk to chip probably
2350405 if youve got a good car you can move ahead as the race goes on even if you have a bad pit stop and fall back if youre fast you can get back to the front it will be more of a pack race than the ones weve had lately where we get strung out
2350406 the car unloaded really fast and we didnt do much to it
2350407 we wanted to emphasize our qualifying effort and we capitalized on what we can do now its time to go forward and think about the race
2350408 if i can answer all of these concerns then will you move forward with this decision
2350409 just because youve been walking for 55 years doesnt mean youre getting better at it
2350410 i understand that john assaraf is on the board of the jenna druck foundation and i have an idea program that i would like to talk to him about that is going to help him give more money to that foundation do you think i could have some time to talk with him

2350413 the olympics for china is a giant spectacle a game but for us its much more than that its a chance to call attention to what is happening in tibet

2350514 the folks at the convention center were extremely accommodating its just too small we were moving exhibitors to the second floor and to hotel ballrooms and tents in the parking lot and then we started to get some pushback from exhibitors and companies who wanted more space and after redesigning the show several times we decided it would not work
2350515 we gave them a lot of options but that convention has grown exponentially
2350516 we had plenty of rooms and hotel space when they booked but at that time they said they needed 2 100 peak night rooms and two exhibit halls and now they say they need 5 000 peak night hotel rooms and every square inch of the convention center and more

2350555 lea t hampton is going broke glam town 12m in the hole
2350556 everybody perceives east hampton to be the home of the rich and famous
2350557 when the summers over its just the same old town just like all these other towns
2350558 the disparity between rich and poor is probably unmatched anywhere in the world you have the heads of multinational corporations billionaires but of the year round population half the work force are undocumented immigrants living below the poverty level
2350559 i dont mind providing the programs but what the general public has to understand is that we dont manufacture money here
2350560 i also wanted to tell you about my experience with the chocolate bars you left amy i saw amy eating one of the bars and decided i would give it a try i was surprised by how hard it was and when i did bite into eat and started eating it i have to say it was the most god awful stuff i ever tasted it kind of reminded me of chewing tobacco i was going to spit it out but decided to finish it anyway as i ate it i was thinking less and less of it shortly after i finally got it all swallowed i began to notice a compulsion to eat some more why i have no idea as the taste of it was not something i cared for none the less i felt drawn to eating another bite finally i gave into the desire and had another bite this time it tasted less harsh so i had another bite and before i knew it i had eaten the whole bar today i found myself drawn to it again and ended up eating another bar it is so weird because it is not even slightly sweet to me i prefer sweet to any other taste so it doesnt make sense to my mind all i know is that i feel almost addicted to it so now my question is what other kind of bars do you guys make i think i might find myself really liking this stuff if you wouldnt mind on your next trip down bringing some of the other kinds you have so i can find which one i like the best i am sure i will become a customer and i will also promote it to those around me so that is my story interesting huh who would have believed it
2350561 whenever i would go to poetry spots i would notice a person can get up and read a heartfelt poem and then the dj would play trick daddys take it to da house
2350562 number one what helps me out is actually listening to the poem
2350563 if its sad or angry as hell based off of emotions and also if the poem has a chorus to it ill start searching for what i think should follow it up
2350564 im focusing on the music and that keeps me on my toes
2350565 if you believe in having sex say hell fuck yeah
2350566 just the night before she had crossed that path made beautiful music in triple time with two notes on one staff line
2350567 he dared she told the truth and they played seven minutes in heaven only they divided three into a square root and got 11 cause there was orgasm after orgasm
2350568 guthrie was caught so off guard that she almost shot water out of her nose
2350569 toys take your clothes off everything i needed to learn about swinging i learned in kindergarten
2350570 imagine eating your favorite dish every single night for the rest of your life
2350571 if you love someone you want them to have their muffins do vanilla couples get married to cock block each other do they look at somebody and say
2350572 all people who have had their land stolen from them from new orleans to palestine
2350573 it was a combination of what radiohead did recently and what they might be giants did a long time ago with their ep working undercover for the man
2350574 tmbg sold you the mp3s for a set price and then mailed you a cd so you got both
2350575 if you look at the numbers from traditional record contracts only the elite of the elite the top 1 to 5 percent would make any money whatsoever off their albums
2350576 over 90 percent of bands signed to a record label would never see a royalty check thats a sad secret of the industry
2350577 in the end its more important that someone hear it than not so i am more inclined to give it away for cheap or for free than to have someone miss out on it entirely
2350578 he sold about as many copies as he sold with his last release which was on a label
2350579 but because of the free downloads he was heard by ten times that and thats affected his ability to tour its affected his entire livelihood for him the pay what you want thing has absolutely been crucial to him or crucial for his career
2350580 even at its peak when it was a thriving industry recorded music only brought artists a fraction of the revenue that merchandise and touring brought them
2350581 today that disequilibrium has been exaggerated by the plunging music retail market and by the expanding music merchandise and performance market
2350582 he got you to drop too huh i knew he didnt have it
2350583 you play by your rules and ill play by my rules
2350584 why would you go see the fins first preseason game against the
2350585 mature fairly quickly and spawn prolifically making them resilient to fishing pressure
2350586 based on our review we believe our investment in aol may be impaired
2350587 after consideration of the duration of the impairment as well as the reasons for any decline in value and the potential recovery period we do not believe that such impairment is other than temporary
2350588 id heard them before but id never really dug in
2350589 i went home and started learning the songs one by one and its become a huge obsession
2350590 but come to think of it maybe theyre just moving so fast because the owner is in today
2350591 but yeah i come here like americans seek out american bars when theyre in england always looking for a little bit of familiarity
2350592 what youve been away that long and still speak with that strong an accent
2350593 so you come to a british pub talk in a british accent and drink a coors light
2350594 but if i drank those all the time id have a huge gut
2350595 its fermented like wine and contains higher alcohol than the beers here do
2350596 you are supreme the chicks will cream for greased lightnin
2350597 ill play a country and western song in the middle of my set ive got no problem with that
2350598 i love r amp b like its a part of my soul so i play that too the whole idea of music lessons is that i teach through music on the show in jamaica growing up we were privy to all types of music we grew up listening to soul to r amp b to jazz to gospel and reggae music incorporates pieces of all those styles so why wouldnt i play that kind of music on my show
2350599 the first day i was on the air there were so many people listening online that it shut down the website
2350600 so many folks were tuned in trying to listen once word got out that i was back on the air that i maxed the thing out
2350601 the thing with luther is hes a longstanding member of the community both the reggae and caribbean community so hes well respected
2350602 hes very professional in everything he does and folks know they can expect the best out of him no matter what
2350603 i dont abide by the rules and i dont play whats in regular rotation everywhere else
2350604 the mainstream radio would never hire me cause im gonna do my thing as a musician you dont want to hear somebody like a program director telling you what songs you have to play new people might think im arrogant and say who is this guy and what do you mean you dont take no requests but if they listen continuously theyll know that were on the same page so much that what i play is what they want to hear anyway
2350605 making this thing big on the web is definitely a priority

2350786 the point is all the effort to fix the church misses the point you can build the perfect church and they still wont come people are not looking for a great church the age in which institutional religion holds appeal is passing away
2350787 church leaders seem unable to grasp this simple implication of the new world people outside the church think church is for church people not for them
2350788 the church was created to be the people of god to join him in his redemptive mission in the world
2350789 god did not give up on his mission in the old testament when israel refused to partner with him god is a reckless lover he decided to go on with the mission himself we do not need to be mistaken about this if the church refuses its missional assignment god will do it another way the church has refused and he is moving on god is pulling end runs around the institutional north american church to get to people in the streets god is still inviting us to join him on mission but it is the invitation to be part of a movement not a religious club
2350790 so heres what i want you to do god helping you take your everyday ordinary life your sleeping eating going to work and walking around life and place it before god as an offering embracing what god does for you is the best thing you can do for him dont become so well adjusted to your culture that you fit into it without even thinking instead fix your attention on god youll be changed from the inside out readily recognize what he wants from you and quickly respond to it
2350791 is considered by most to be the foremost spokesman for the emerging church
2350792 although i do have a sense of what you mean about the reality of serving the poor juxtaposed with a glitzy looking campaign
2350793 the world is overcome not through destruction but through reconciliation not ideals nor programmes nor conscience nor duty nor responsibility nor virtue but only gods perfect love can encounter reality and overcome it nor is it some universal idea of love but rather the love of god in jesus christ a love genuinely lived that does this
2350794 whoever thinks he understands divine scripture the gospels or any part of it but whose interpretation does not build up the twofold love of god and neighbour has not really understood it
2350795 we come here to meet god we come here for healing we come here to worship

2350807 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2350808 the new organization capabilities in vmware lab manager 3 will help us better enforce role based access rights to system configurations in the lab according to our it policy says tony anastasio technology architect for cerner the leading u
2350809 we have development teams working on trading gateways for virtually every major futures exchange around the world
2350810 vmware lab manager 3 gives us much more flexibility in the way we deal with a global lab environment it simplifies administration supports multiple networks and lets us assign resource pools and manage user access rights for all of our teams from a central location vmware lab manager has quickly become the industry standard virtual lab automation solution used by software development and testing teams worldwide said raghu raghuram vice president of products and solutions vmware this new release expands the appeal of vmware lab manager to more groups of people at our customers by promoting effective self service combined with centralized it control
2350811 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2350812 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2350813 the census bureau notes that idahos population is 91 percent caucasian
2350814 the one size fits all approach of your new minority registration goals will present significant challenges for states such as our own
2350815 giveaway the shield season 6 dvd set and season 7 poster
2350816 badge on my page and have it actually mean the page is valid
2350817 its not my job i didnt say it in an ugly tone of voice
2350818 i was already freaked out because she was accusing me of stuff i didnt do
2350819 you dont go to jail because you like different restaurants do you
2350820 by the power of truth i while living have conquered the universe
2350821 a good reader is like a person who knows how to take a hint
2350822 i dont want to feel unappreciative i love being here its amazing being here
2350823 we have been informed that there is a positive result involving one of our athletes
2350824 the write off is the result of the application of accounting rules relating to the probability that we will recover our investment
2350825 it does not imply any judgment on our part on the viability of midwest
2350826 its good to see public acknowledgment that our story was accurate all along
2350827 probably the biggest question about this whole mess is why the mainstream media protected edwards by ignoring the story for the past 8 months
2350828 i think its entirely appropriate for a news organization to wait to report a story until they have information that theyre comfortable with reporting
2350829 all i can say is that were not in the business of printing things we dont know to be true
2350830 the problem with a story like this is that its very very difficult to ascertain the truth until one of the people steps forward
2350831 the national enquirer is a supermarket tabloid that is accurate some of the time and inaccurate some of the time
2350832 it was the subject of late night talk shows and certainly all over the web
2350833 it was in our culture and in our faces and to act as if it didnt exist would be to ignore reality
2350834 it is genuinely much more difficult for them to regulate their food intake appropriately
2350835 you still want to address it from a very healthy perspective and try to change the things you have control over keeping in mind the things you do not
2350836 we eat at home to avoid going out because thats where all the traps are
2350837 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2350838 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2350839 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2350840 he wanted to live in the big country and maybe get famous now that i see all this hes really famous
2350841 we are now checking if he could be the german citizen christian karl gerhartsreiter
2350842 in germany up to now he has not been conspicuous we know nothing about him
2350843 he tells me hes clark rockefeller i believe him i havent been shown any hard evidence that hes something other than what he tells me he is
2350844 in every place there are troublemakers some stay like that and others change
2350845 but i wouldnt want to come out and say definitively who this person is
2350846 were probably not going to confirm this persons identity until we have a birth certificate in our hands
2350847 he was like guys you arent even going to school that much
2350848 i didnt get a creepy feeling i just thought that he was a spoiled brat
2350849 that we were peasants and his father had told him not to talk to peasants
2350850 he had a kind of a rich person kind of distance thing going on
2350851 he can be funny at times witty laughs at your jokes he walked into the yacht club pretending like he owned the place
2350852 he claimed hed ordered some furniture that hadnt arrived yet
2350853 customers like industrials theyve been oversaturated with banks and finance
2350854 he was a sales manager and never made a sale so eventually he was fired
2350855 if anybody touches my stuff ill bring my german luger
2350856 it started to become very apparent that whatever he said was a story it was made up
2350857 at most places but especially wall street your word is your bond and whenever you get someone like this youre sitting on a liability and so it was that more than anything that prompted the firm to decide that wed be better of without him
2350858 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2350859 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2350860 jeremy piven is eager to remind us of the duality of the character of ari gold
2350861 that jeremy piven submitted to emmy judges this year a stand out of the tv season that makes him a good bet to repeat another win
2350862 hes incredibly abrasive he says the unthinkable and the unsayable but hes a monogamist man who will do anything to help his family in this particular case hes gotten in the way of his sons education and he finally has to go literally to the doorstep of the headmaster in the middle of the night and grovel
2350863 you cant get away with this in our society and yet people do and so its fun to watch this particular ride its just so juicy to dig in there and get into the belly of the beast with this guy
2350864 i think shes a little over it shes loves being at home dressing casually viewing it that way
2350865 is in better condition than we hoped given the condition of the crash site
2350866 escape windows seat belts and other factors that would tell us something about the difficulties passengers would have had evacuating the aircraft
2350867 hed never been in a helicopter before so he was really looking forward to that too
2350868 we said all our i love yous that was the end of every conversation
2350869 intended to prevent main rotor shaft structural failure loss of power to the main rotor and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter
2350870 we have a 110 000 safe flight hours on them theyre a superior aircraft
2350871 is a competitor of ours a very safe company and a good competitor so its very unusual that something like this happened
2350872 it provides a lot of hope for a lot of players
2350873 the golf course is so nasty right now just nasty
2350874 i dont know if there is such a thing as too hard this shouldnt be la la land for us out here its a major but my mind is still mushy i dont even know my name right now out there theres just so much going on with the course so much you have to deal with its going to get tougher and this course already is just so nasty so hard so tough
2350875 thats the truth i would tell you if i hit a bad putt but that stuff happens
2350876 we dont want rain but it would be easier for us to play with rain i dont think the course is difficult its difficult now because of where they put the pins some of the pins its like miniature golf out there there are some mounds that they put them right in between and its just up over one and down another and its tough
2350877 it tests every single part of your game im not complaining majors should be tough tests
2350878 is just tricky there is going to be a lot of complaining
2350879 there are a lot of holes out here that are almost unplayable
2350880 they are a little ridiculous i dont think its real fair when you hit good shots and in some cases you get penalized for them
2350881 i dont know about out of control but its about as tough as you could ever want to play it
2350882 off the tee its more of a u s open than a pga championship the green complexes are so severe that youre almost being tested on every shot that you hit theres no letup
2350883 you dont have to like it theres nothing against that
2350884 youve just got to accept the holes for what they are and try hard on every shot and try to you know hit every shot to the best of your ability
2350885 im glad to get out of there with what i did my short game was unbelievable i made a lot of great up and downs which you need to do when things are so brutal
2350886 with the opening of the beijing olympic games the world has entered an olympic period during these special days the outbreak of armed clashes in south ossetia is something the worlds people do not wish to see
2350887 a ceasefire can give people the chance to reflect on the massive carnage brought by war
2350888 we hope the various parties in the south ossetia dispute exercise calm and restraint and solve their differences through negotiations and not force
2350889 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2350890 they all give a damn and they want to find a way out of this nightmare
2350891 one of the stopping points was the whole felony charge
2350892 youre the mayor and a lawyer you cant have a felony thats the key
2350893 if the mayor wants to end this he knows what he has to do
2350894 there have been plenty of meetings among business leaders its at the top of the agenda lets face it these are business leaders invested in the city and they want it to reach its fruition
2350895 some say its stalled some say the spiral is going the other way
2350896 hes a friend and its hard when friends get in trouble when pete said hes the best mayor weve had in 24 years he meant it
2350897 liberals and conservatives blacks whites religious all trying and hoping we can get there
2350898 i know what they talked about most was how to get out of this the best way we can because right now no one is looking for a win win to use the old pr speak but everybody is trying to avoid a lose lose
2350899 lets be honest the city council stuff is going to take many months
2350900 we have a legal process that has already started and will kick into high gear next month its all everybody talks about
2350901 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2350902 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2350903 are you ready to stop the fighter jets who are in the air theyre about to bomb the civilian population what are we going to do
2350904 the immediate restoration of the status quo before violence erupted and cessation of hostilities
2350905 this raises serious concerns about the commitment of russia to respect georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity as well as questions about ultimate russian intentions and objectives
2350906 there are reports about ethnic cleansing in villages of south ossetia the population is panicking and the number of refugees is increasing a humanitarian catastrophe is in the offing and here
2350907 it is the russian federation who really was supporting and is supporting militarily the regime in tskhinvali and sukhumi who are the perpetrators of the ethnic cleansing
2350908 the olympics for china is a giant spectacle a game but for us its much more than that its a chance to call attention to what is happening in tibet
2350909 the chinese government can be lets say difficult maybe all this attention will push them to change
2350910 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2350911 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2350912 georgian military forces completely control all the territory of south ossetia
2350913 they have sent in their troops and weapons and they are bombing our towns
2350914 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as am obliged to protect lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located
2350915 we wont allow the death of our compatriots go unpunished
2350916 ta r rivero and go came into this olympics as medal favorites
2350917 im not the only one whos saying that the international federations know ahead of the olympics who the favorites in their respective events are
2350918 i would say that these two are well equipped to go as far as the shootoffs in their events
2350919 everything depends though on experience and luck you cant have one without the other
2350920 the new organization capabilities in vmware lab manager 3 will help us better enforce role based access rights to system configurations in the lab according to our it policy says tony anastasio technology architect for cerner the leading u
2350921 we have development teams working on trading gateways for virtually every major futures exchange around the world
2350922 vmware lab manager 3 gives us much more flexibility in the way we deal with a global lab environment it simplifies administration supports multiple networks and lets us assign resource pools and manage user access rights for all of our teams from a central location vmware lab manager has quickly become the industry standard virtual lab automation solution used by software development and testing teams worldwide said raghu raghuram vice president of products and solutions vmware this new release expands the appeal of vmware lab manager to more groups of people at our customers by promoting effective self service combined with centralized it control
2350923 i am going to see my grandma who i havent seen in almost 18 19 months and whos getting to the age that i want to make sure i am spending time with her on a consistent basis and so she can see her great grandchildren
2350924 and i want to spend some time with those children as well
2350925 we had a very long primary we had the longest primary in history and so i can imagine folks need a break from politics
2350926 i think that the majority of people had been fed a constant stream of political chatter and i am sure that having a couple of weeks off and enjoying the olympics is probably what the doctor ordered for everybody
2350927 during the middle of a campaign youre always worried about taking some time off
2350928 i think there are a lot of democrats who are nervous
2350929 i think they thought this election would fall into their laps
2350930 an artificial expectation that he needs to be way ahead at this time
2350931 history is replete with northern liberals who end up losing
2350932 anybody gone into whole foods lately and see what they charge for arugula rocket
2350933 not long ago a couple of hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
2350934 i predict that will be translate into a vote for obama
2350935 whats most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces
2350936 life in the spotlight must be grand but for the rest of us times are tough
2350937 painful taxes hard choices for your budget not ready to lead thats the real obama
2350938 part of the old tired politics of a party in washington that has run out of ideas and run out of steam
2350939 his quote was roughly within a couple of words ive had enough of people asking me about the cardinals im a cub now
2350940 so i would treat him like he never played here i would wait until the end of his career and i would remember he was a cardinal i would ignore the fact that he was ever here for now because thats what he wants i would honor his request forget the cardinal days until his career is over
2350941 its a little odd to play against a group of individuals that ive been so close to for so long its like playing in the backyard with your family so its different that way
2350942 but you know you got to separate and move on
2350943 thats what its all about having fun the guy thats pitching over there is a great friend of mine
2350944 hes been a good player his whole career he had a good day today i didnt notice anything and nobody said anything to me about it
2350945 if you look around everybody gets excited when they do great thats just the way the game is today
2350946 thats why we call it a team at some point in the season all 25 count
2350947 i know what my job is i just got to stay ready when they need me
2350948 he didnt leave me a whole lot of plate but i thought i might have snuck my hand in there when he called me out he had a pretty good view of it
2350949 china thief leave our country stop killing in police forcibly dispersed the protesters some of whom tried to storm the embassy police official ramesh thapa said more than 1 000 people were detained for violating a ban on demonstrations the largest number of tibetans detained in a single day in katmandu in india more than 2 000 protesters marched in dharmsala a northern hill town that is home to the tibetan government in exile and the in china three americans who planned to hold tibetan flags during the opening ceremony were detained by police as they traveled to beijing national stadium director lhadon tethong said police did not confirm the incident while the spectacle of the opening ceremonies was broadcast on large screens in londons trafalgar square the chinese embassy was the focus for protesters railing against the countrys treatment of people in tibet the olympics shouldnt have been offered to china on the basis of their human rights record
2350950 the olympics for china is a giant spectacle a game but for us its much more than that its a chance to call attention to what is happening in tibet
2350951 its important that we show the world that we stand up for those in prison and dying
2350952 one olympic ideal the separation of sport and politics died in the chinese night
2350953 this was the choreographed demonstration of might the like of which the olympics has never seen a rebuke to vocal critics of chinese foreign and domestic policy sitting in the audience
2350954 the age of chinese power dawned in a spellbinding and futuristic curtain lifter which featured 15 000 different types of costume and 14 000 performers 9 000 of them on loan from the
2350955 to say these games would be a landmark in world politics was no idle claim last night proved it
2350956 in a short time approximately 31 300 individual charitable and small business investor accounts will receive more than 8 2 billion in liquidity and approximately 9 200 investor accounts holding tax exempt auction preferred shares will receive nearly 3 3 billion in liquidity
2350957 ubs also will begin the process of restoring 10 3 billion in liquidity to approximately 1 000 institutional investor accounts
2350958 the united states calls for an immediate ceasefire to the armed conflict in georgias region of south ossetia
2350959 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2350960 we underscore the international communitys support for georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders as articulated in numerous
2350961 calls on all parties to cease hostilities and to resume without delay so as to secure a political solution to the crisis which respects georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2350962 there was a lot of energy out there for the freshmen for the first time at this level it was like big 12 football
2350963 chase patton did a real good job today and anytime somebodys not there its an opportunity for somebody else
2350964 i felt that without question patton did some good things and i thought blaine did some good things
2350965 big easy so dubbed for his imposing size and fluid golf swing ruptured the acl in his left knee while sailing in 2005 and went through a similar surgery
2350966 i know exactly what hes going through at the moment
2350967 you know its a bit of a frustrating time but in the same breath too its great because you can spend time with your family and chill out for a while instead of traveling all around the world hes not in a great position but hes not in a bad position either
2350968 its going to take him a while to get over that injury
2350969 i guess his first tournament might be i would guess would be bay hill or something like that in march and then try to get himself ready for the masters
2350970 the first couple of weeks when he comes back it will swell up and hell feel it and hell feel it for another six months thats what i went through so hes not going to be over this injury for another year after he has come back hes in for a bit of a treat so to speak
2350971 but as i said before hes a tough guy i mean winning the u s open with a busted up knee hes a very tough guy
2350972 i have had a lasik surgery and have been wearing lasik lenses which have a hard center flatten out at the end
2350973 i had some infection in there and my doctor said that i needed to let my eyes rest by keeping the contacts out
2350974 he gave me cortisone and steroids which were very painful and it was annoying and difficult to be trying to fight a tough golf course and have my eye aggravating me at the same time i love the pga championship and i hate to not be competing but i have to get ready for the ryder cup
2350975 my wish was to have the course set up as it would be set up for a major championship
2350976 i think this golf course is setup more like what a u s open was set up three or four years ago where missing the fairway by a couple of yards is the same as missing it by 10 yards
2350977 there is no difference once you go off theres no first cut second cut third cut of rough lets say
2350978 i know im very close to being able to help in whatever role it may be
2350979 theyve pretty much told me they are grooming me down here to pitch in the backend of games up there
2350980 we can go into a company if they need help with a security awareness program
2350981 there are an amazing amount of things that we could see by watching the traffic go by
2350982 we were saying there are so many of them they are everywhere
2350983 its completely against what all of us are trying to do
2350984 these are the first gdp gross domestic product figures to come out and they anticipate a general setback in
2350985 even if italy is suffering from a more unfavorable situation than france we have every chance of seeing a contraction of about 0 3 percent or more in the whole of the eurozone
2350986 even the german gdp expected next week is likely to show a fall of 0 8 percent

2350989 i dont say i need to make that but i hate when they fight me over another 25 000
2350990 why cant you do something different why go back to something you already had
2350991 that was like twenty bucks at amoeba for the whole thing theres twentysomething cds in there its from when he moved to america in the 50s or 60s and recorded all of his stuff with the cbs orchestra classical cds are supercheap now
2350992 thats my friend maryclare she drew that for me maryclares actually one of my bandmates sometimes shes a flute player and we have another band called paul and diane shes in switzerland right now and she sent me all these drawings
2350993 i have a friend who worked at digidesign he hooked me up with this admittedly way out of date system but for my purposes its fine the next record will be better recorded leone recorded his eponymous lp on a digital 4 track recorder i have better everything better mikes better performances better instruments better protools
2350994 i bought this at a flea market here and i love working on piano most of the time i do my writing here before i start recording
2350995 this is a good book its about 20th century classical music and about the various movements strands and composers its good at putting things into context
2350996 willie winant is a percussion instructor at mills and other places and hes played with everybody john zorn sonic youth everybody
2350997 you know it really sucks being at work when youd rather be engaged in some form of wild behavior that results in a climax lol
2350998 in these pages she encourages mothers and grandmothers daughters and granddaughters to never lose faith to speak out and make their voices heard to focus on what matters most and follow their dreams wherever they may lead
2350999 i just want a story and a few good songs that will take me away i just want to be entertained i mean isnt that the point
2351000 one of the things that came out of that case here and is very clearly spelled out in the film is the notion of branding those kids as purely evil
2351001 in the history of england in the last 20 years
2351002 the one criticism is that we werent bold enough in showing the murder which is bollocks
2351003 on blogs and message boards id see what people were writing
2351004 and there were people writing in a way that made it clear they read the
2351005 but something immediately sympathetic about someone from a lower upbringing the struggle
2351006 people get behind it more im also much more attracted to those roles im not really caring right now about privileged people with high class problems
2351007 it would probably be better to have the hummer tour of san francisco
2351008 from a smog standpoint i cant tell you exactly what the magnitude of emissions are but i can tell you for a fact that its worse than the hummer or escalade
2351009 thats why were making the investment and cleaning everything up
2351010 name three things about yourself youd really like to change
2351011 well for starters i would be less of a workaholic and maybe i would work on not being so dang conscientious and oh yeah i really could stand to be a lot less organized
2351012 i came upon an elderly woman who was in cardiac arrest immediately i began to administer cpr but it was too late i failed to save her life and even knowing that i did my best is little comfort to me
2351013 we will continue to do the best job we can but we may not be able to have as many officers in the stations
2351014 unfortunately theres a lot of resentment of heather for who she is without regard for what shes accomplished shell be fine
2351015 shes a very good person she means well and she works her ass off but its not working and i dont think many people would argue otherwise
2351016 its like watching your pitcher serve up one home run ball after another and not seeing the manager come out of the dugout
2351017 youre right what they did was wrong well handle it in house
2351018 in america youre forced to choose a side even in hip hop
2351019 a rebellion without direction the culture hasnt progressed forward at all
2351020 the reality is ive worked with teenage prostitutes with aids
2351021 14 year old girls walking by with their asses hanging out theres no way to make that sound good
2351022 the generation of hip hop before me the forefront was the mc by the time i was coming up a lot of emphasis was on the beat
2351023 she pretty brown honeysuckle miniskirt bottom booty cheek all trouble concrete cold hustle sharp in the street hop in a strange man jeep and run him his fees she only fifteen and love her gorilla pimp taking the cheese
2351024 i was watching everybody be hard when do we get to stop being hard
2351025 he could no longer carry on living without having at least tried to conquer those towers
2351026 dont let any new people into the club were a full house now
2351027 tickets bought with their credit cards could be picked up by their kids at the door
2351028 we call on china at the same time that they host the olympics to improve on news freedom speech freedom and political repression internationally we wish they use their veto power at the un security council and stop supporting brutality in tibet myanmar and darfur

2351189 one olympic ideal the separation of sport and politics died in the chinese night
2351190 this was the choreographed demonstration of might the like of which the olympics has never seen a rebuke to nicolas sarkozy vocal critics of chinese foreign and domestic policy sitting in the audience
2351191 the age of chinese power dawned in a spellbinding and futuristic curtain lifter which featured 15 000 different types of costume and 14 000 performers 9 000 of them on loan from the peoples liberation army

2351201 america the beautiful is not shrill or alarmist nor does it strain to shock us darryl roberts its director and narrator speaks in a pleasant low key voice but the film is pulsing with barely suppressed rage and by the end i shared it
2351202 these are a bunch of guys who are desensitized who just dont care i do believe this film means something totally different to women 18 to 30 than it does to a man 50 to 60
2351203 we kind of put our little toe in gingerly because weve never done anything like this before

2351237 we have development teams working on trading gateways for virtually every major futures exchange around the world
2351238 vmware lab manager 3 gives us much more flexibility in the way we deal with a global lab environment it simplifies administration supports multiple networks and lets us assign resource pools and manage user access rights for all of our teams from a central location vmware lab manager has quickly become the industry standard virtual lab automation solution used by software development and testing teams worldwide said raghu raghuram vice president of products and solutions vmware this new release expands the appeal of vmware lab manager to more groups of people at our customers by promoting effective self service combined with centralized it control
2351239 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2351240 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2351241 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2351242 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2351243 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2351248 he really believes he can play right handed right now
2351249 i wouldnt be afraid to do that whether we will nor not i dont know
2351250 some members of the council need more time this negotiation has not come to a halt tonight and will be resumed tomorrow saturday
2351251 the expectation around the world is for a ceasefire for an end to use of russian aerial bombing missile attacks use of combat forces us ambassador zalmay khalilzad told reporters
2351252 show restraint and to refrain from any further acts of violence or force
2351253 with the connivance of a number of security council members
2351254 we will not allow to go unpunished the deaths of our compatriots
2351255 historically russia was and will remain the guarantor of the security of the people of the caucasus
2351256 humanitarian assistance cannot be used as a pretext for the presence of non georgian troops
2351257 the parties to show the utmost restraint and refrain from actions that would further inflame the situation
2351258 its an afghan government plan he gates has endorsed and we are now working to achieve
2351259 now who would pay for that those are the discussions we are just now beginning to enter into it would be wrong to assume we are going to shoulder this burden alone
2351260 we are going to work with our allies to determine how we can finance this necessary growth
2351261 quality versus quantity we are focused there on reforming the police forces that currently exist
2351262 the main additional responsibility he is assuming is for the training mission which is just an essential mission for the afghans and for us
2351263 the sooner they are a capable fighting force and can assume responsibility for protecting their own people and their borders the sooner us forces and the worlds forces can come out
2351264 we had other programming commitments and respect for other audiences so we cant keep all the people happy all the time
2351265 the ratings results from thursday for make me a supermodel and the soccer show the decision was vindicated
2351266 its not my job i didnt say it in an ugly tone of voice
2351267 i was already freaked out because she was accusing me of stuff i didnt do
2351268 you dont go to jail because you like different restaurants do you
2351269 if the government heard the jurys message it will not use a flawed war court to prosecute conduct that does not violate the laws of war
2351270 the lesson i hope the government learns from this case amongst other things is dont bring skimpy or weak charges of conspiracy
2351271 i think this is the big five and they want to get them into court before the election so they can validate this process
2351272 what they dont realize is if they have this kind of genetic make up they are on their way to dependency
2351273 what we dont know is far greater than what we do know
2351274 violent video games have been a problem for a long time
2351275 some parents dont know what their children are playing and are just happy they are not out of their sight but these games can have very damaging psychological effect on children especially games which depict violence so casually
2351276 if the committee decides the games are dangerous we may ask the distributors to halt distribution
2351277 no tax shall be laid or appropriation of public money made in aid of any church or private or sectarian school or any public service corporation
2351278 how perfect expected and fortuitous not to mention profitable that
2351279 not that you need catchy names to move porn but anything sexual with the name tijuana attached to it assured that the consumer would be confronted with some beastly swarthy over the top sexual witnessing that would leave them ready to empty their gonadic profits onto sheets tissues sheep or worse
2351280 this is exactly the type of political posturing that has characterized the last four years under mr thomas
2351281 it clearly appears that thomas is trying to buy favor with the radio station and one of the talk show hosts
2351282 all i can say to you andrew thomas is i had not decided for whom to vote come november
2351283 youre a shoe in im not going to even look at the other guys you keep doing what youre doing and ill help you get as many votes as you can
2351284 of course there will be transfers of sovereignty but would i be intelligent to bring this to the notice of public opinion

2351300 you make some excellent points rosemary and i wish that everybody were as concerned about the issue as you are and i appreciate the call
2351301 i believe that rosemary has a bumper sticker that says visualize world peace
2351302 he does it because hes in pain from the injuries he got as a prisoner of war his hands hurt constantly so he rubs them together
2351303 planes land and take off any old how just as boats dock and leave again without the state authorities even being informed about it
2351304 a rusty nail placed near a faithful compass will sway it from the truth and wreck the argosy
2351305 israeli authorities are labeling it a terrorist attack although they say there is no clear motive and the man a construction worker acted alone it is not known if he had links to any terrorist organization
2351306 if the terrorist who carried out the attack in jerusalem really is a resident of east jerusalem who enjoyed state funds we must demolish his house and deport his family to gaza emphasis added
2351307 his christians future was decided by a chance encounter when the actors bill travers and virginia mckenna walked into the shop owned by christians owner to buy a pine desk they had recently starred in the film born free which tells the true story of the wildlife conservationist george adamson and his wife joy who raised a lion cub called elsa in kenya then rehabilitated it into the wild and they immediately suggested that adamson might be able to help
2351308 the way they were dressed could also possibly have been something which was provocative and this might have been something which led to the actual incident itself
2351309 who are very concerned about the possibility of a us military incursion against their homeland
2351310 a new 21st century understanding of track ii diplomacy initiated through theological diplomacy must go hand in hand with the formal diplomatic search for the peace that has always been at the centre of the holy books of both christianity and islam
2351311 while in tehran and qom one of the holiest cities in iran we spent a great deal of time discussing the common religious values and themes shared by both christianity and islam our commonalities centred on issues of peace as well as the moral prohibition of developing and using weapons of mass destruction in addition to agreeing that politicians have been behaving childishly my iranian colleagues and i also think that the level of ignorance by christians and muslims about each others religions has been extremely unhelpful in extending positive dialogue between these two great monotheistic religions and our two nations
2351312 iran can also look to the history of unwelcome involvement by the united states in its internal affairs the covert overthrow of popular prime minister mosaddeq in 1953 the propping up and support of the unpopular shah the us governments military support of sadaam hussein in iraqs war with iran and the failure of the clinton administration to embrace the emerging moderate leadership of president khatami eventually leading to khatamis isolation by hardliners in his government
2351313 the protagonist hannah recalls her childhood friends khalil and aziz two palestinians who in 1948 disappeared along with 800 000 of their people in the last chapter she imagines her two friends coming back to blow everything up by then hannah has descended into madness she must also know that the destruction of the palestinian society was necessary for the creation of israel unlike her generation however hannah is willing to admit what she knows but thats only because she is mad
2351314 a palestinian hannah would also acknowledge that the damage has been done and attempts to undo israel could only lead to further damage and that palestinians must forgive israelis forgiveness is good and a decent society must do the good thing it might also be the only hope to save present and future palestinian generations from the curse of a damaged past
2351315 this is probably a mad dream a palestinian hannah might not exist not in the near future and if she existed she might be failed by the israelis the alternative however is the greater madness of a conflict that would go on for the next 60 years
2351316 our young generations are going to understand that in the past the arabs were open they mixed with many people theyll see pieces that represent the arabs in spain and will realize there were three religions islam christianity and judaism mixing and respecting each other we were living together in peace then we can do it now
2351317 his highness believes that in order to guarantee sustainable development you have to start with education the public system we have is stagnant and outmoded he gave me a free hand to implement these social reforms we believe our people deserve the best if we do not utilize all the wealth that we have in the interests of our people history will judge us
2351318 i think they young women understand that you dont need to lose your arab identity to be modern there were some voices trying to drag us to the stereotype of the feminist movement another stream followed the very conservative way for me we need to find our own way we have to cherish our culture and heritage and at the same time be modern it gender gap is serious as part of the huge scale of human violation that is taking place today in this part of the world people will burst someday people can see whats going on in the world they want the same quality of life that other people are enjoying when it comes to freedom and enjoying rights and expressing opinions we have to be serious about our problems and shortfalls its time to have self reflection and self criticism if we are really genuine about our reforms and if we want to make a historical change
2351319 too often we honor swagger and bluster and wielders of force too often we excuse those who are willing to build their own lives on the shattered dreams of others
2351320 some look for scapegoats others look for conspiracies but this much is clear violence breeds violence repression brings retaliation and only a cleansing of our whole society can remove this sickness from our soul
2351321 for there is another kind of violence slower but just as deadly destructive as the shot or the bomb in the night
2351322 this is the breaking of a mans spirit by denying him the chance to stand as a father and as a man among other men and this too afflicts us all
2351323 when you teach a man to hate and fear his brother when you teach that he is a lesser man because of his color or his beliefs or the policies he pursues when you teach that those who differ from you threaten your freedom or your job or your family then you also learn to confront others not as fellow citizens but as enemies to be met not with cooperation but with conquest to be subjugated and mastered
2351324 we learn at the last to look at our brothers as aliens men with whom we share a city but not a community men bound to us in common dwelling but not in common effort
2351325 we must admit the vanity of our false distinctions among men and learn to find our own advancement in the search for the advancement of others
2351326 our lives on this planet are too short and the work to be done too great to let this spirit flourish any longer in our land of course we cannot vanquish it with a program nor with a resolution
2351327 but we can perhaps remember if only for a time that those who live with us are our brothers that they share with us the same short moment of life that they seek as do we nothing but the chance to live out their lives in purpose and in happiness winning what satisfaction and fulfillment they can
2351328 im amazed by the misconceptions about muslim women and the arab world that i hear and that really does hurt me i dont believe that there is fair enough understanding of either our status as women or the total context of our lives which is very rich and multi faceted it is all too easy to draw conclusions and make sweeping judgments about millions of muslim women based on fleeting television images that is not right i think we have to try harder
2351329 when asked what they most admire about the west muslims pointed to 1 technology 2 a value system of hard work self responsibility rule of law and cooperation and 3 fair political systems with respect for human rights democracy and gender equality
2351330 muslims and americans are equally likely to reject attacks on civilians as morally unjustifiable
2351331 among the muslims surveyed 7 percent condoned the 9 11 attacks when asked why they supported the attacks the radicals gave political rather than religious reasons they have a sense of political frustration and feel humiliated and threatened by the west those who opposed the attacks often gave religious reasons for doing so large majorities of muslims would guarantee free speech if it were up to them to write a new constitution and they say religious leaders should have no direct role in drafting that constitution
2351332 majorities in most countries believe that women should have the same legal rights as men they should have the right to vote to hold any job outside the home that they qualify for and to hold leadership positions at the cabinet and national council levels
2351333 majorities of men in virtually every country including 62 percent in saudi arabia 73 percent in iran and 81 percent in indonesia agree that women should be able to work at any job they qualify for
2351334 in saudi arabia where women cannot vote 58 percent of men say women should be able to vote
2351335 while muslim women favor gender parity they do not endorse wholesale adoption of western values
2351336 what can the average american citizen do to solve the crisis in the middle east
2351337 start by learning more about the real middle east challenge your own assumptions about the middle east lobby for diplomacy and dialogue in foreign policy and simply reach out to your muslim neighbor
2351338 its probably as revolutionary and groundbreaking as mozart gets these days a german based quartet staged saudi arabias first ever performance of european classical music in a public venue before a mixed gender audience the concert held at a government run cultural center broke many taboos in a country where public music is banned and the sexes are segregated even in lines at fast food outlets the friday night performance could be yet another indication that this strict muslim kingdom is looking to open up to the rest of the world
2351339 the last few weeks have witnessed leaders as well as people nationally and internationally fighting ignorance about muslims and islam especially concerning women their education and status in society in march custodian of the two holy mosques king abdullah bin abdulaziz made an intense plea for a dialogue among muslims christians and jews the king said he planned to hold conferences to get the opinion of muslims from other parts of the world and then meetings with our brothers in christianity and judaism
2351340 more than a dozen jewish rabbis including two from israel were in attendance this week as this conservative muslim sheikdom opened one of the gulfs first scholarly centers dedicated to interfaith dialogue ibrahim al nuaimi the director of the interfaith center sponsored by the ruling family said the goal is to
2351341 the streets of cairo the historic neighborhoods of syria the mountainous terrain of lebanon and the bustling markets of baghdad were for the first time in thousands of years emptied of one of the most successful ethnic minorities living within their communities
2351342 it wasnt all bad blood between the arabs and the jews in fact there were stories of heroism that have gone unreported and unnoticed in the arab media
2351343 in recent history only the two forward thinking middle eastern kingdoms of morocco and bahrain have broken the mold of suspicion toward their jewish citizens and integrated them into the social and political spheres
2351344 is it not time to reassure the jews of arab origin that their ancestral homes are mature enough to welcome them back if they decide to invest visit or even take up citizenship
2351345 the project could create work for a million israelis palestinians and jordanians draw eight million tourists a year to israel and produce a billion cubic meters of desalinated water jordans king abdullah and saudi prince walid bin talal have already given their enthusiastic endorsement of the project according to its initiators
2351346 surprising op ed piece in the egyptian press calling on palestinians to forgive israel as key to moving forward
2351347 i must say that forgiveness is mostly a gift to myself in order to be able to live some quality of life and in honor of my parents and all the innocent people that perished so tragically
2351348 carlson 48 raised 90 000 for five schools and quit her job to move here to work full time with ly she formed a board of directors for the plf which distributed school supplies to 1 955 children

2351356 zionism be it right or wrong good or bad is rooted in age old traditions in present needs in future hopes of far profounder import than the desires and prejudices of the 700 000 arabs who now inhabit that ancient land
2351357 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2351366 they federal agents seem to be desperate to capture people to prove that they are enforcing the law they are going to go to any extreme
2351367 authorities may seek to identify and verify their legal stay in this country
2351368 the fact that the executive has noticed an appeal in this matter does not signify that we think further litigation is the exclusive path forward
2351369 i am glad that mr fielding has agreed to my suggestion of attempting to resolve this matter by negotiations and we will of course set up a meeting with his staff for next week
2351370 declining to stay the order would impose the very harm compelled appearance of the presidents closest advisers that the defendants say the constitution prohibits and which they seek to appeal
2351371 generally speaking those who own memberships on the grain exchange are not dumb people

2351387 come on maliki get out of the capitol and do something
2351388 my name is mike hendrickson i work in the applied research laboratory here at penn state in my part time job i am a marine infantry officer preparing for a deployment to iraq mr nordland can you explain why the iraq analysis of a distinguished professional journalist is completely divergent from the estimate of the situation of a professional war fighter like me can you explain why you feel the situation in iraq is lost but i feel that the united states military can and will be successful in the long term
2351389 if you were secdef what would you do in iraq
2351390 hey im just a journalist im not qualified to answer that question
2351391 look im just an infantry captain i would not presume to be able to parse the national security strategy of the united states into a coherent plan in iraq from the vantage point of the secdef however i will tell you that the commitment of the american people to support the long term efforts of the united states militarys mission in iraq will be key to our success please remember this 63 years after the end of wwii we still have forces in germany and japan
2351392 mr nordland do you believe that there is a burgeoning political divide in the american media between fox news and rupert murdock on one side and news organizations like nbc who have apparently made a conscious decision to go after the liberal demographic on the other is it just background noise
2351393 ok youve got the newsweek baghdad bureau chief here you have one question to ask him fire away
2351394 sir given the reality of the situation on the ground in iraq given the fact that you must do your reporting behind bodyguards and body armor and give that it is logistically challenging and expensive to even leave the safety of the green zone doesnt that create a serious bias in your reporting

2351417 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

2351424 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue

2351489 there were not that many children here for a long time

2351491 it is not one of those neighborhoods where everyone keeps to themselves

2351507 all i can tell you is word of mouth many of the merchants have indicated to me that business is at normal levels normal meaning before the fire
2351508 the challenge has been that people have seen the fire image and felt as though we in fact were not open that could not be further from the truth

2351575 we were harmed by the very people who took an oath to protect us

2351595 we have a true main street right in the middle of the neighborhood and that adds to the strong feeling of community mindedness
2351596 library full of books clothes and her two pet cats
2351597 whatever might be the issue matters raised in the cabinet should not be brought outside and whatever issues have to be brought up should be done in party fora and with the leadership

2351612 eine superbrand ist eine marke mit hohem ansehen und marktwert die selbst in wirtschaftlich schwierigen zeiten durch qualit t best ndigkeit und kundentreue berzeugt es ist ein produkt oder unternehmen das unverwechselbar und gleicherma en den inbegriff der qualit t einer leistung oder eines ganzen produkt bereichs reflektiert und damit sowohl im bewusstsein der verbraucher als auch der wirtschaft ber jahre und jahrzehnte manche sogar ber jahrhunderte eine herausragende stellung einnimmt eine erfolgreiche marke bietet ein so hohes ma an qualit t ist so anziehend und vertrauensw rdig dass sie gef hle der zuneigung und loyalit t hervorruft und verbraucher bereit sind einen h heren preis zu zahlen als dem produkt an sich angemessen w re
2351613 als die ersten rinder im amerikanischen westen mit einem gl henden eisen markiert wurden tat man dies um sie wieder erkennbar zu machen fortan war das rind nicht mehr gleich rind der wettbewerb um die marke hatte begonnen marken schaffen hei t dingen eine eigene pers nlichkeit zu verleihen sie unverwechselbar zu machen die superbrands sind weiterhin im kommen denn sie geben uns orientierung unterst tzen unseren trieb nach kontinuit t und verl sslichkeit und selbst no name ist heute ein superbrand
2351614 eine superbrand ist eine marke die kontinuierlich vertrauen in ihre qualit t schafft die subjektiv ein gutes gef hl gibt die autorit t hat mit der sich der verbraucher identifiziert f r deren wert man bereit ist auch einen entsprechenden preis zu zahlen
2351615 superbrands sind die k nigsklasse der produkte und dienstleistungen sie schaffen ein hohes ma an vertrauen beim verbraucher stehen f r qualit t und verl sslichkeit und f r das gewisse etwas sie haben eine einzigartige identit t sind authentisch und unverwechselbar sie halten ihre produktversprechen langfristig manche ber jahrzehnte hinweg und vermitteln dem konsumenten damit ein st ck heimat superbrands setzen ma st be doch was gut ist wird auch kopiert durch me too produkte oder illegal so beziffert der aktionskreis gegen produkt und markenpiraterie den schaden der deutschen hersteller j hrlich durch die herstellung und den verkauf illegaler produktkopien entsteht auf rd 30 mrd euro allein an den deutschen grenzen beschlagnahmten die z llner im jahr 2005 nachgeahmte artikel im wert von 213 mio euro die europ ische kommission will mit einer reform ihres zollsystems und hohen strafen den kampf gegen produktpiraterie versch rfen nicht nur mit solchen sanktionen wird es trittbrettfahrern zuk nftig schwer gemacht auch in zeiten der globalisierung ist schlicht die bestehende substanz entscheidend f r den anhaltenden erfolg der superbrands
2351616 relevanz aktualit t begehrlichkeit und image das sind die eigenschaften die meiner meinung nach wirkliche superbrands aufweisen gleichg ltig aus welchem bereich sie kommen diese vier kriterien erf llen sie allesamt die markenstars ber cksichtigen dabei gekonnt evolution re ver nderungen in markt medien und zielgruppen ihre macher wissen genau wohin sie langfristig wollen superbrands sind evergreens und keine kurzlebigen hits sie sind leuchtt rme kein buschfeuer also das schnell hell lodert und bald nur noch glimmt coca cola bmw nivea puma becks aber auch die bild zeitung mtv oder google sind nur ein paar beispiele daf r superbrands inszenieren einen gro teils unseres lebens was w ren wir ohne sie superbrands machen unsere welt erlebnisreicher und bunter sie bieten nutzen und mehrwert wecken mit ihrer unverwechselbarkeit emotionen und sehns chte sie stellen einen besonderen wert dar f r jeden einzelnen der sich immer wieder f r sie entscheidet sie spielen eine wesentliche identit tsstiftende rolle f r k ufer anwender und konsumenten aufgrund ihrer substanz verf gen sie ber das entscheidende ma an innovationskraft das unabdingbar ist f r die weiterentwicklung von wirtschaft und erfolg in einer modernen hoch entwickelten volkswirtschaft
2351617 eine starke marke zeichnet sich durch strahlkraft und verl sslichkeit aus erg nzt um ein einheitliches kommunikationsmuster und die st ndige ver nderungsbereitschaft an marktanforderungen entsteht eine superbrand eine superbrand wird geliebt bewundert beneidet imitiert bek mpft und manchmal auch verachtet die damit verbundene faszination und emotion ist eine ma gebliche triebfeder f r wertsch pfung in einer gesellschaft
2351618 starke marken basieren auf einem hervorragenden image und strategischer markenf hrung sie berzeugen mit harten faktoren wie umsatz marktanteilen und ertrag und schaffen es emotionen zu wecken und nachfrage zu stimulieren wenn das richtige gesch ftsmodell und eine vitale marke optimal vernetzt werden l sst sich nicht nur in den klassischen m rkten sondern auch im internet gutes geld verdienen weltweit die zukunft solcher marken liegt in der optimalen nutzung der medienkonvergenz eine starke marke zeichnet sich dadurch aus dass sie unverwechselbar und eindeutig ist sie soll dem kunden klarheit und orientierung bieten sowie kaufentscheidungsprozesse erleichtern helfen austauschbarkeit ist das gef hrlichste was einer marke widerfahren kann marken brennen sich in unser ged chtnis ein und ver ndern uns
2351619 der brauch produkte zu kennzeichnen und sie somit aus der anonymit t zu heben ist jahrhunderte alt das markieren von produkten ist also keine erfindung unserer zeit schon im alten rom gypten troja wurden gegenst nde mit symbolen versehen um ihre identit t zu kennzeichnen mit der berzeugung dass die von einem bestimmten hersteller produzierten waren besser sind als andere superbrands sind kein selbstzweck sie dienten schon fr h und heute umso mehr der identifikation und differenzierung von produkten ziel war und ist es markierte ware begehrenswert zu machen so dass sie gegen ber herk mmlichen produkten vorgezogen wird superbrands sind die leuchtt rme im nebel des marktes die dem verbraucher auch in noch so schwierigen phasen eine orientierung bieten sie stehen wie felsen in der brandung der reiz berflutung und trotzen somit wind und wetter hei t preis und werteverfall superbrands sind wie leitplanken f r alle die mit der marke in ber hrung kommen von der produktentwicklung der produktion dem marketing dem verkauf dem handel bis in die vorratskammer der verbraucher sie geben den notwendigen seitenhalt und man kommt nicht von der marken bahn ab wichtig hierbei ist dass die marke immer den weg des verbrauchers bereitet und sich z b von einer einspurigen stra e weiterentwickelt zu einer sechsspurigen autobahn und hierbei wieder die richtung vorgibt
2351620 marken gibt es viele aber darunter sind nur wenige superbrands was zeichnet sie aus sie stehen f r klare werte und ein starkes versprechen besonders was die produktqualit t angeht superbrands sind relevant sie haben eine klare orientierungsfunktion konsumenten greifen nach ihnen selbst wenn sie zur preis premium kategorie geh ren rabattschlachten k nnen ihnen so gut wie nichts anhaben superbrands sind krisenresistent ihre au ergew hnliche st rke tr gt entscheidend zum erfolg des gesamten unternehmens bei superbrands sind sp testens bei der bilanzierung von marken l ngst selbst ein asset und k nnen sogar den unternehmenswert steigern voraussetzung ist allerdings eine kontinuierliche markenpflege markenmanagement ist also kein selbstzweck sondern reines wertmanagement nicht von ungef hr geh ren die deutsche telekom allianz und daimlerchrysler zu den wertvollsten dax marken dar ber hinaus haben es eine reihe von marken aus dem online gesch ft wie google ebay und yahoo innerhalb von wenigen jahren in die gleiche liga geschafft neben den klaren markenwerten der globalen ausrichtung und den kontinuierlichen investitionen in die marke haben diese suerbrands noch etwas anderes gemeinsam sie holen den konsumenten mit integrierten kommunikationskonzepten ber alle touchpoints hinweg ab denn ber werbedruck allein kann heute keine marke mehr zur superbrand werden

2351664 we felt like they were making a good faith effort to pay the money
2351665 board members have to understand they are running a business not playing school
2351666 this clearly vindicates what we said back then that the school was a mess it still is
2351667 we were in such trouble and the state was threatening to close us down
2351668 there were suspicions that shady things were going on he portrayed himself as independently wealthy so it didnt seem like he would need it
2351669 we were the ones who see these kids everyday so we thought why would you bring this out in front of us
2351670 the conclusion we came to was that joel believes his own lies
2351671 for its first 10 minutes you may be forgiven for thinking that
2351672 he is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office
2351673 we are walking to market square in the center of town to celebrate
2351674 i dont see kanye as being cool very talented but not cool
2351675 hes very hyper but talented give him about 10 years and well see there are some cool people out there i think snoop is cool puffys cool its embodiment its gotta be in you im so cool that even when im sweating its a cold sweat
2351676 i dont know if you were able to watch our set because you were too busy eating sandwiches and potato chips but we had a good time

2351681 since the beginning of time children have not liked to study they would much rather play and if you have their interests at heart you will let them learn while they play
2351682 i knew virtually nothing about conventional music education and i knew nothing about what childrens music was supposed to be but the kids had a better grasp of what they liked emotion drama and making music as a group this was not the way music was traditionally taught but i never liked conventional childrens music which is condescending and ignores the reality of childrens lives which can be dark and scary these children hated cute they cherished songs that evoked loneliness and sadness
2351683 outside music archivist and langley chronicler irwin chusid insists that these strange and charming renditions of songs like space oddity im into something good and desperado have artistic merit surprisingly hes right in its own surreally amateurish way this stuff is both accomplished and addictive

2351690 looking and seeing both start with sense perception but there the similarity ends
2351691 the purpose of looking is to survive to cope to manipulate to discern what is useful agreeable or threatening to the me what enhances or what diminishes the me this we are trained to do from our first day
2351692 when on the other hand i see suddenly i am all eyes i forget this me am liberated from it and dive into the rality of what confronts me become part of it participate in it
2351693 it is in order to really see to see ever deeper ever more intensely hence to be fully aware and alive that i draw what the chinese call the ten thousand things around me drawing is the discipline by which i constantly rediscover the world
2351694 seeing and drawing can become one can become seeing drawing
2351695 what really happens when seeing and drawing become seeing drawing is that awareness and attention become constant and undivided become contemplation
2351696 the art of the transcendent expressing the highly developed consciousness of a future species of humanity that would possess radically new organs of sight as well as a new and universal language a revolution in human consciousness an evolutionary psychic change that would alter the consciousness to a state similar to that achieved through the spiritual discipline of yoga
2351697 that the genesis and development of abstract art were inextricably tied to spiritual ideas current in europe in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries

2351720 you know who is in charge now the gestapo agents at homeland security they are in charge
2351721 every american should be offended and outraged by comparisons between our dedicated public servants risking their lives every day to enforce our immigration laws and the nazi secret police no matter who is making the comparison that such a vile statement was made by a member of congress is truly reprehensible and irresponsible
2351722 ice actions have been entirely legitimate and carried out in a professional manner in an effort to deal with a national illegal immigration crisis
2351723 such a reckless comparison to the gestapo borders in making such comparisons congressman gutierrez is providing license for people to resist by any means necessary
2351724 fair joins with dhs assistant secretary julie myers in demanding that the house leadership take action against representative gutierrez his statement deserves the strongest possible condemnation from his colleagues
2351725 the government of sudan tried to convince the people of darfur that the non muslims in the south were our enemies and used us to oppress the southerners
2351726 but now that we darfurians are the victims lopez and other southern sudanese are doing what they can to stand up for our people despite the fact that their family members were killed by soldiers from darfur
2351727 darfurians will help build the school for southerners and southerners will welcome darfurian muslims into the community and school not as enemies by as their brothers
2351728 as a muslim and a darfurian it grieves me that darfurians were sent to southern sudan to fight in the name of islam i know much of lopez lomongs suffering as a lost boy was caused by soldiers from darfur that he would stand up for darfurians is an example to all of sudan that darfurians and southern sudanese are brothers and we should not ever again be used as enemies of one another

2351730 ive learned a lot become a better professional and a better man because of my experience and my time in new york i dont regret or feel ashamed about anything that happened to me in my time in new york
2351731 the most difficult part is just the realization that the organization no longer wants you
2351732 you spend eight years there and in the blink of an eye youre no longer wanted there
2351733 was i before or after peter dowding i dont recall
2351734 youll never see her again ive tied her up and hidden her under the bed
2351735 leaving a dog in a car on a hot day
2351736 the roads maintenance team is aware that the carriageway surface in hillside road and particularly the junction is less than ideal
2351737 it has been assessed for possible inclusion in surfacing programmes along with others throughout the city unfortunately due to financial constraints and when considered against other streets it has not been possible to include hillside road to date
2351738 an annual review will be carried out again within the next few months and hillside road will again be considered for inclusion in a surfacing programme
2351739 in the meantime the area supervisor will continue to inspect the carriageway and make safe as required
2351740 please note that i have been advised that unfortunately rapid rhino repairs to the junction would not work because the carriageway construction below the surface is a dry bound mix
2351741 extensive standard patching could not be justified because of cost it would be more cost effective to use surface treatment such as ralumac nimactocote or possibly in situ retread for the whole street however this streets priority would need to be considered for such treatment against other similar streets throughout the city
2351742 i can confirm that an order has been placed this morning with tayside contracts for carrying out the works to seymour street
2351743 it is anticipated that they will be on site at the start of september to carry out the works we tried pushing for an earlier start date but due to their commitments with the school projects that is not possible
2351744 after a rather frantic week of discussions to try to get a satisfactory solution to this issue i am pleased that we have a way forward
2351745 the report to the recess sub committee will recommend that the council assists this initially to the end of the current financial year to allow the services to be promoted during that time to encourage greater use and it also gives the city council time to progress proposals for community transport to assist different communities across the city who do not have easy access to the main bus services
2351746 i am extremely grateful to all my constituents in the west end who highlighted the impact the loss of the 72 service particularly friends of magdalen green and west end community council
2351747 clearly the matter still requires committee approval and the proposal sees only a limited number of buses per day but its a great step forward from the position a few days ago when it looked likely these services would be lost

2351774 we cant dabble in the business policies or the personnel policies of an airline
2351775 what we found was that because they carried less fuel on the airplane they were getting into situations where they had to tell air traffic control i need to get on the ground
2351776 the additional cost of carrying unnecessary fuel adversely affects americans financial success
2351777 we didnt see any proposed changes we thought needed to be made
2351778 to either not stop for fuel when needed or to carry insufficient amounts of fuel
2351779 adding fuel indiscriminately reduces profit sharing and possibly pension funding
2351780 its a safety of flight issue and it needs to be treated as such
2351781 if dispatchers and pilots are saying the airlines are pressuring them and its having a chilling effect on the decisions they make every day in regard to the fuel loads and it looks its like eroding the authority of the pilot in command then that issue needs the attention of the government regulators who are there to oversee the system

2351785 this is likely in response to all of the media attention and awareness that has been brought up over the past couple of days
2351786 my assumption is that they took the time and effort to do some reconnaissance of sites which are vulnerable to remote file inclusion or other type of remotely exploitable flaw within their web applications that would allow someone to locally host all the malicious files

2352288 this is nothing like the place that we came to four years ago
2352289 we are like fraternal twins so similar that its scary
2352290 hes more like a big brother but not father material
2352291 i was placed in the mgm mentally gifted minors program and they segregated us in 4th grade which is the year my mother got divorced for the second time and everything was hell i mean we had knives and guns being drawn in the kitchen and i was supposed to be learning spanish i dropped out of it because i felt like i couldnt keep up or handle the teasing i endured from my friends for being conceited i refused to go unless my mom put me in a regular class for the longest time i was terrified when people said i was smart like theyd find out i was a fraud sooner or later
2352292 i knew i didnt want to grow up to be like my family i knew i was different i didnt just want a job with benefits and a tract home in the suburbs i had passion i wanted to see the world to study to be in control of my own life i was obsessed with kids on the jerry lewis telethon and the boy with leukemia in something for joey yet any time i said i wanted to be a doctor i got that oh sure uh huh response i cant count the times my mother said you arent going to change the world little girl when i was in college one of my uncles berated me for wanting to be some corporate bitch who thought she was too good for where she came from my vision was just not part of their world view
2352293 but really not so much a mother still you know it hurts my heart to say it but its true
2352294 i think hes in a position now where his due is coming
2352295 the guys getting recognized as a legitimate top of the rotation guy for any team in the big leagues im glad a lot of other people are starting to recognize what hes all about were very very fortunate to have him
2352296 i dont feel any different with my record today than i did a month ago
2352297 i really feel that for the most part when ive been on the mound our team has been in the game thats the most important part
2352298 jeremy guthrie set the tone he set down a very good offensive club tonight
2352299 im not making no excuses because that guy over there threw pretty good thats the first time we had it handed to us in a while
2352300 those two guys put fear into a pitching staff but we have to go with what we have
2352301 you cant always rely on offense you have to pitch to stay in close games sometimes
2352302 man that guy knows how to drive in those runs doesnt he
2352303 you hate to see those guys come up in those situations
2352304 i knew i hit it well but i saw him dive for the ball and said noooo
2352305 i was playing in a little bit trying to stop the bleeding with a runner on second base
2352306 it mightve been tailing away a little bit it was close thats all i had there was nothing else left in the tank i was at full speed
2352307 over the last couple of months i dont think theres been a better player in the league not just hitting but fielding too
2352308 when things are going bad what can go bad will go bad
2352309 it doesnt last forever but when youre in it it feels like it
2352310 when a team is on a bad roll as were the as you want to keep them down
2352311 not sure my role long term is as a closer
2352312 but ill come in from the bullpen pitch a couple of innings and anything i can do to help the team i will
2352313 he got us to hit the ball on the ground
2352314 when you dont throw a million mph youve got to be able to hit your spots and just let them know that youre going to control that part of the plate
2352315 apparently there is a third inning in detroit when youre pitching
2352316 if you look at that right handed hitting starting lineup for us it was pretty impressive
2352317 i thought he mixed them well he made some pitches when he needed to he was efficient i thought he pitched a very very good ball game especially with it being his first time out up here
2352318 i just felt like i didnt fit in like anything i was doing wasnt fitting in
2352319 it was hard trying to make people happy it made for long years
2352320 i think with st louis that was probably it for me i was excited for the opportunity and just excited to be coming here having a chance to come up here and compete
2352321 we just wanted to try and make it as easy and as comfortable for him as possible
2352322 we really wanted to work off of him let him pitch his ball game and go about his business the way he goes about his business
2352323 everyone is all about communication here from what ive gotten so far
2352324 weve got to try and be patient with him and hope he learns something every time he goes out there
2352325 happy to have josh return as a member of the hawks

2352379 in the seventies when gasoline was in short supply the speed limit on highways was reduced to 55 miles an hour because that was the most efficient cruising speed
2352380 what is the most efficient cruising speed for modern cars
2352381 in modern cars four five and even six speed transmissions are more common
2352382 but even today the target speed for efficiency isnt much higher 55 to 65 mph 88 to 104 km h

2352410 we should immediately call a meeting of the north atlantic council to assess georgias security and review measures nato can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation
2352411 the u s should immediately convene an emergency session of the united nations security council to call on russia to reverse course
2352412 at the request of russia the u n security council held an emergency session in new york but failed to reach consensus early friday on a russian drafted statement the council concluded it was at a stalemate after the us britain and some other members backed the georgians in rejecting a phrase in the three sentence draft statement that would have required both sides to renounce the use of force council diplomats said
2352413 in 2005 mr scheunemann asked sen mccain to introduce a senate resolution expressing support for peace in the russian influenced region of south ossetia that wants to break away from georgia the records show such resolutions of senate support are symbolic but helpful to countries in their diplomatic relations the senate approved sen mccains resolution in december 2005 and the georgian embassy posted the text on its web site sen mccain has endorsed georgias goal of entering nato a matter for which the country hired mr scheunemann to lobby in 2006 sen mccain gave a speech at the munich conference on security in germany in which he said georgia has implemented far reaching political economic and military reforms and should enter nato a text of his speech on the conference web site shows
2352414 t he georgian leaders quickly moved to widen their borders at the expense of their armenian and azerbaijani neighbors and their territorial greed astounded foreign observers the free and independent socialist democratic state of georgia will always remain in my memory as a classic example of an imperialist small nation one british journalist wrote both in territory snatching outside and bureaucratic tyranny inside its chauvinism was beyond all bounds
2352415 the reason lado did this is because he knew the enormous pr value that georgia would gain by going to the money people and analysts particularly since georgia is clearly the aggressor this time
2352416 lado is a former banker himself so he knew that by framing the conflict for the most influential bankers and analysts in new york that these power bankers would then write up reports and go on cnbc and argue lado gurgenidzes talking points it was brilliant and now youre starting to see the american media shift its coverage from calling it georgia invading ossetian territory to the new spin that its russian imperial aggression against tiny little georgia

2352454 it wasnt what i expected and it is a little disappointing he parkmore ed was bit lit up and i had to keep him under control yesterdays disruption didnt help and i think the authorities made more of an issue of it than necessary
2352455 its only early here in hong kong and we can already feel the humidity rising and its going to be very stamina sapping over the next few days the absence of zara phillips has certainly weakened the interest in the eventing schedule but it shouldnt weaken britains medal hopes
2352456 so is this teams event or individual or both does this relate to overall eventing where they do the jumping and cross country etc thanks
2352457 i was warned about the heat and humidity but they didnt tell me i was going to nearly drown

2352471 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2352472 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2352473 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2352474 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2352475 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2352476 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2352477 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2352478 the settings of currports utility is now saved to cfg file instead of using the registry
2352479 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2352480 when i responded to the scene i found a solo vehicle that had hit a tree
2352481 my preliminary estimates put the vehicle at a very high rate of speed approximately 100 mph that was also substantiated by witnesses who actually observed the collision
2352482 it was a pretty major impact that caused the front end of the car to break off
2352483 driven by their love and devotion mothers and fathers across the country have raised awareness demanded funding and opened our eyes to the needs of so many children
2352484 i think its time we had a government and a president who recognized the seriousness of autism and addressed it head on
2352485 many individuals with autism need assistance in the areas of education employment transportation housing health and recreation
2352486 with access to these types of services and supports individuals with autism can live full rich productive lives
2352487 the need to identify and provide services for adults with autism will grow rapidly over the next few years

2352505 these foreign immigrants driving around in cars getting cars from the government while single irish mothers dont get the same is wrong if i thought id get enough votes id represent the irish people id look after our own
2352506 a deep sense that the government isnt serious about our position as a neutral state
2352507 this is not a disaster which they have been trying to make out in fact this can be a rallying call for workers throughout europe who have been at the brunt of this neoliberal juggernaut from the eu in terms of privatisation of services attacking their pension rights attacking the idea of a decent wage and a proper job
2352508 true friends do not become pariahs just because they disagree with you

2352521 the united states and russia must take the lead in striving to abolish nuclear weapons
2352522 these two countries should begin implementing broad reductions of nuclear weapons instead of deepening their conflict over among others the introduction of a missile defence system in europe
2352523 i dont need to search i already know the truth
2352524 no we only stock up to size 31 we dont find that there is much demand for anything over a size 31 sorry

2352534 child slavery in haiti may be the ultimate symbol of a state that has failed its most vulnerable members
2352535 key to ending child slavery in haiti is creating long term economic options for parents and access to quality education for children

2352537 the pakistan rupee traded 1 1 with the indian rupee at the time of independence
2352538 when he has a whacked out at bat he really tries too hard the next time too
2352539 we have a banking crisis and an agency crisis and a mortgage crisis and a coming credit card crisis weve never seen anything like that before and it all seems to be coming home to roost at the same time thats never happened either
2352540 but we did not even have credit cards in the 1930s there were no such thing as student loans
2352541 what ive said is that im playing the hand that was dealt and that my responsibility is to protect the u s economy and the american people
2352542 i think the trend in stocks is up i do feel that july 15 represented the bottom for stocks and we are going to move higher
2352543 i really feel that what investors are looking for right here is signs that the economy is starting to pick up right now
2352544 no one knows how significant the decrease will be but theyre betting that it will be more significant than less if thats the case then logic should dictate that the ongoing earnings power of those companies should be less because they have fewer assets upon which to earn money
2352545 that has implications for the extension of credit and the deployment of capital by those institutions
2352546 you think you make any money in investment banking away from this part of it
2352547 investment bankers are loss leaders youre paying these very ordinary guys two million three million million and a half for what they do one deal a year maybe your balls are on the line with the leveraged lending part of it and you dont get paid for the risk you get to the point where thats your business and your business is flawed

2352549 in a short time approximately 31 300 individual charitable and small business investor accounts will receive more than 8 2 billion in liquidity and approximately 9 200 investor accounts holding tax exempt auction preferred shares will receive nearly 3 3 billion in liquidity
2352550 ubs also will begin the process of restoring 10 3 billion in liquidity to approximately 1 000 institutional investor accounts
2352551 even though im a lawyer and we have an office of lawyers litigation is the last resort
2352552 were trying to get people help right away litigation can take years
2352553 were not a case by case adjudicator and you dont want settlements like this to be made on a political basis
2352554 our main job is to determine if theres any statutory or regulatory fix to keep it from happening again
2352555 we tend to start with the largest because that can make the greatest impact
2352556 people will get their money and get it back in the immediate future
2352557 windows mail encountered an unexpected problem while displaying this message
2352558 but if the problem is with the message body and not windows mails index we may be able to help
2352559 we are adopting an inquirer first policy for our signature investigative reporting enterprise trend stories news features and reviews of all sorts what that means is that we wont post those stories online until theyre in print
2352560 for our bloggers especially this may require a bit of an adjustment some of you like to try out ideas that end up as subjects of stories or columns in print first if in doubt consult your editor or me or chris krewson
2352561 learys memo to me is saying that your web site is little more than radio news with a few news packages you can send off for antediluvian awards and pats on the back you will only focus on the breaking coverage and then youll shovel the paper online at a later time oh and if you use your blog to collaborate and tweak your print stories maybe you wont get to do that any more
2352562 75 percent of what we do online will not change
2352563 blogs offer us a great way to keep people coming back to the great work produced by the inquirer throughout their day theres no quicker way to break news than on a blog and no better way for us to leverage our staffing advantage over other local media in addition beat reporters with blogs say the process has helped them cultivate and nurture sources
2352564 had i seen that memo before i came to work here eight months ago im not sure i would have applied for this job but having gotten to know the people here i know that they are not ignorant of the internet
2352565 would you rather be covering a press conference or provoking one
2352566 the news business has always held some completed stories until theyd have space to run them with the prominence they deserve
2352567 if you put all your features online as soon as theyre finished with the editorial and production process just because you always have enough space online without regard to the timing that would offer the best print play thats the tail wagging the dog
2352568 for how many years did i read about the evils of shovelware we were all right in saying that so why is it wrong now to say let print be print and let online be online
2352569 i want the inquirer to be the live button on philly com i want us to always be telling people whats happening right now thats something that we have the staff and resources to do and very few other operations can
2352570 nikki tinker has the passion and experience needed to get results in washington d c
2352571 a remarkable young leader tinker is a strong advocate for women families and for those who are most in need of a voice her background in public service work in the business sector and dedication to the residents of memphis ensure that nikki tinker will bring a fresh perspective to congress for tennessee and for the country
2352572 im proud to receive this endorsement from emilys list and to have the support of its members in tennessee and across the country
2352573 from the moment i set foot in the halls of congress i will work on the issues most critical to memphis and all of tennessee encouraging new jobs in the district strengthening our education system for our children and working to ensure affordable health care and insurance is available for all residents i learned the importance of public service by working my way through school and it is a lesson that will continue to guide me as i serve this great district
2352574 we were shocked to see the recent ads run by the nikki tinker for congress campaign we believe the ads are offensive and divisive emilys list does not condone or support these types of attacks
2352575 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling
2352576 many of those offshore leases are deepwater potentially lucrative but expensive the shallower the lease the less costly the exploration there is another factor at work as well part of an oil companys worth is the reserves of oil it owns or leases so amassing lots of leases boosts its stock value it is always good to lease more
2352577 mccain told reporters last month that we have untapped oil reserves of at least 21 billion barrels in the united states
2352578 in the eastern gulf of mexico those resources are likely to represent actual oil because the geology is an extension of the western gulf of mexico where oil has been drilled for years there is less certainty about what may lie off the atlantic coast
2352579 if in fact there are 17 8 billion barrels of oil offshore that would equal half the reserves of nigeria or about 60 percent of proven u s reserves it could substantially reduce u s imports for a decade or two or sustain u s production when other fields decline
2352580 mccain told reporters last month that we have untapped oil reserves of at least 21 billion barrels in the united states
2352581 in the eastern gulf of mexico those resources are likely to represent actual oil because the geology is an extension of the western gulf of mexico where oil has been drilled for years there is less certainty about what may lie off the atlantic coast

2352583 remember that natural gas pipeline the oil companies magically never seem to build to the north slope
2352584 and production would not be expected to start before 2017
2352585 saying that production wouldnt begin for 10 years democrats oppose offshore drilling just like they did 10 years ago
2352586 why the democrats cant make the oil companies the bad guys on this issue is beyond me
2352587 its a delicate balance and that balance is being skewed by the 24 7 world of internet and cable news faster faster is the mantra but we need to try our damndest to fact check on demand
2352588 opt out means yes depending on what they meant by opt out and hyphen

2352592 consolidation projects almost always fail if their goal is to save money i work for a large company made up of several mergers and even after nearly a decade its still run like a bunch of smaller companies with separate systems
2352593 with any large multidepartment consolidation you will normally run into tension that can stall or even cause the project to fail if everyone that needs to have a vested interest in it does not fully participate
2352594 the skills and background to help troubled agencies make better decisions
2352595 perhaps you should reconsider your terminology cloud is an architecture not a service
2352596 filling out 50 forms in a week is an entirely different thing and its not just numbers theres also frustration about being asked to do work that is not a physicians responsibility such as policing employee absenteeism
2352597 i have over a dozen of them in my pending basket right now
2352598 anybody that has any type of dynamic need in their environment

2352600 he decided he wanted to produce his assignment as a web site with a little coaching i convinced him to look at googles and ebays services and have a little fun placing banner ads on his homework using the google and ebay web apis which support simple rest urls he was able to easily cut and paste the code needed without really understanding what the code did into his assignment and presto he was linked into both googles and ebays powerful soas several months later he has made over 5 on his homework from ad revenue this is a real motivator to do homework
2352601 by going the woa plus rest route instead of soa plus soap the requirements for extending the application dropped considerably

2352605 the ottawa citizen tuesday june 28 2008 canada is in a tight race with the united states for an unwanted title slowest adopter of electronic medical records in the developed world only one in five or 20 per cent of american doctors uses electronic medical records the new england journal of medical reported this month and less than nine per cent of practices with three or fewer doctors use them in canada according to the 2007 national physician survey fewer than 10 per cent of doctors have switched entirely from paper to electronic records though about a quarter use some combination of the two the stubborn attachment to old fashioned filing cabinets is unfortunate digitizing medical records reduces medical errors improves preventative care and saves administration costs and canada is so far behind most other countries in this area that its embarrassing the benefits to patients and workers however are too great to ignore in this sense the situation is analogous to that facing other industries which deal not with patients but with customers adapting to technologies requires an outlay of money and resources but without these investments it will be impossible to remain productive organizations plagued by inertia and technophobia will suffer and that includes public sector health care organizations to their credit the federal and provincial governments have invested more in health care information technology than has the u s but that is a meagre accomplishment we should strive to be better than second worst
2352606 a lot of analysis and scanning is going on during this process but it is all at virtual speed in the physicians brain
2352607 in a typical emr scenario however the same workflow may take much longer because each step requires extra clicks and scrolling
2352608 creating prototypes of new user interfaces to help stimulate vendors and others who are developing the emr systems of the future
2352609 this may be scary for vendors used to showing physicians something that looks familiar
2352610 but vendors will be much more successful if they can move away from the paper based paradigm and take real advantage of computers

2352621 there were 22 in the cell yesterday and we were jam packed but they split us up one half in one cell and one half in the other
2352622 the average number of people in the cell was 15 and i slept on the floor all the time i dont think there are beds in brazilian prisons
2352623 they said i wasnt supposed to be with real criminals but the majority of people there were hardened criminals who happened to be in for child maintenance
2352624 i was worried about my safety when i first went in you go through an initiation process when you go in when the other prisoners gather round you and they surround you in the little bathroom

2352661 youll never have a chance to see these performers together on the same stage anywhere else in the world
2352662 i deliberately tried very hard not to make it a revenge book
2352663 i wasnt out to hang anybodys head from the highest pole in town that wasnt the intent
2352664 a brilliant contemporary rock writer he would have been a fabulous poet if he werent a musician he was a literary major and not only that hes gifted with a brilliant voice
2352665 whether it was a question about the crew or the artwork or whatever we were doing i kind of had a ball gag shoved in my mouth and a check shoved in my hand
2352666 they interpreted it as a challenge to their authority which was not the intent at all for me to do it was just simply trying to make certain i wasnt getting screwed
2352667 instead of just watching these guys youre actually interacting sharing stories and really finding the common ground you dont always get at a big music festival
2352668 any kind of car under the sun is what we want
2352669 last year we had about 500 cars this year we hope to have even more

2352676 shes determined even if her determination takes her back in time or into discussions with people who are long dead we dont care about such frivolous things as time and space alive and dead

2352678 the whole thought of the record is based on how i had been brought up
2352679 my family is fully about love and respect and supporting the people that can be supported and helping others that can be helped
2352680 we sat down and decided that we have to make this record and we have to do it kind of quick
2352681 so thats when the chord based songwriting really came into play
2352682 i never wanted it to be a parody or a joke
2352683 wed have whoever we were touring with just come up and jam with us
2352684 to explore the potential for painting to provide immediate pleasure
2352685 at a time of record stock market highs and low levels of unemployment
2352686 an era when one third of the nation lost home and work and savings but clung to pride and dignity
2352687 we died in your hills we died in your deserts we died in your valleys and died on your plains we died neath your trees and we died in your bushes both sides of the river we died just the same
2352688 theres a guy outside who says he wont come in until you let everybody in
2352689 ive learned a lot become a better professional and a better man because of my experience and my time in new york i dont regret or feel ashamed about anything that happened to me in my time in new york
2352690 the most difficult part is just the realization that the organization no longer wants you
2352691 you spend eight years there and in the blink of an eye youre no longer wanted there
2352692 live as if you were to die tomorrow learn as if you were to live forever
2352693 clearly these revelations show that there are always at least two sides to every story
2352694 these are serious charges and you have a serious history
2352695 suffice it to say mr evans you are looking at the high end of the sentencing range and a significant period of time if you are found guilty or should plead guilty
2352696 we will make the equipment work but this is not something that ohio should be satisfied with for the long term

2352698 if these all in one devices adopt usb it will finally be easy to use them from the imac and pci based power macs

2352700 hi tried to send pictures before but it didnt work
2352701 its nothing im ever going to get out of my head
2352702 the water had her pinned against an apple tree and she was holding onto her son
2352703 she was yelling for help i cant hold onto him much longer
2352704 it poured so hard you couldnt see two feet in front of you for a really long time
2352705 there was so much roar from the water rushing its amazing the fire department heard the screams

2352707 its the kind of round ive been looking for to get myself back on the leaderboard and feeling the good vibes
2352708 when i got here on tuesday i called home and i said this is the hardest golf course ive ever played
2352709 if i were to play here every day i dont know if i would enjoy it its a very difficult golf course
2352710 im not that aggressive if im not hitting my driver good
2352711 if im hitting bad shots with it you dont hit it as much you hit it right where youve looked whale away
2352712 if youre hitting where youre aiming it every time youre hitting good
2352713 my senior year of high school i went out and watched tiger
2352714 a lot of the players they said hit the ball really long
2352715 its just a matter of taking care of the opportunities that im given theres weeks where you can play your best and not win and theres weeks where you can kind of stumble your way in and win
2352716 unfortunately things didnt happen for me on the back nine its very difficult and this is a major
2352717 theres a lot of golf left out here and the golf course is very difficult
2352718 so i think that it wont be overly difficult if you play well to make up some ground
2352719 we did not find any false or fake drivers licenses on them

2352722 our family has been through a lot some caused by nature some caused by human weakness and some most recently caused by the desire for sensationalism and profit without any regard for the human consequences none of these has been easy but we have stood with one another through them all although john believes he should stand alone and take the consequences of his action now when the door closes behind him he has his family waiting for him

2352727 youd have thought the pga would have learned from the u s opens wonderful setup with rough that got progressively worse as you got further from the fairway
2352728 i went into the rough a foot and couldnt even get a lob wedge to the green from 95 yards i asked my playing partners if i was out of order and they said no if you are slightly off line you are crucified they are sucking the fun out of the major championships when you set it up like that i cant recall it happening before and cant think of a reason why they would do it other than to irritate the players with some chips you are just trying not to take four to get down

2352755 theres a whole range of issues ive got problems with

2352758 i have no objection with a family going its their choice but i certainly wont be part of it

2352793 but no shit iowahawk might get up tomorrow get baked grab his beautiful wife and ride his moped backwards to a hells angel rally then drink himself into oblivion and fight about 7 crank dealers from the racine chapter of the death jokers all by himself then maybe hed go home romance the beautiful wife build a perfect retro treehouse for his perfect kids drink a bottle of tequila prepare a 3 course meal while beating away a push in home invader and sacrificing him on a makeshift though historically accurate inca altar he built in the woods behind the railroad tracks then hed sit down and knock out a tremedously insulting leftist parody that pissed off thread after thread of kos and du lunatics romance the bride once again and fall asleep chuckling its like hes paul bunyan and mark twain rolled up into one hipster
2352794 i dont like you i love you in a gay way
2352795 i take my hat off this belongs to a very select group of jokes i wish id thought of first
2352796 bloody magnificent is there a nobel prize for comedy if not we damn well need one
2352797 the excellent weblog iowahawk summarized some of the thoughts i had i must also laud david burge of iowahawk for his gritty pragmatism he is no armchair crusader full of empty imprecations
2352798 if iowahawk ever decides to turn his guns on you accept your beating with good grace and a rueful chuckle if you try to fight back it only gets funnier
2352799 next time iowahawk beats up on you just take it if you try to fight back it only gets worse its like one of those monsters that the harder you fight it the stronger it gets because it actually feeds on your pathetic swats

2352803 id say iowahawk was a genius but geniuses arent generally very clever plus studies have shown that nine out of ten have no idea how to clean a carb so statistically speaking his geniushood is unlikely

2352809 iowahawk and his lovely wife did not appear to be the psychopathic stalking killers we had been warned about although that iowahawk did have a murderous look in his eyes and an unusual amount of froth coming from his mouth
2352810 i really dont know how best to summarize iowahawks you are there white trash treatise if you crossed hunter thompson and michael lewis you might get something this angry and bizarre
2352811 hands down the best damn roadkill centric caucus coverage youll read
2352812 should be required reading for all students planning a career in journalism
2352813 inspired i was going to say parody but really it is far too close to the original to be called a parody really it is like the play hamlet stages to catch the conscience of the king a dramatic re enactment of the very crime claudius had committed but had yet to acknowledge it worked for hamlet will iowahawks performance work for the rest of us it is too early to tell but it is more truthful and far more amusing than anything youll read in the new york times
2352814 between cleaning carburetors and restoring classic american cars burge churns out some of the funniest and decisively deadly wit and commentary on the web write the pulitzer committee and demand iowahawk should win
2352815 good lord thats nifty may not be the coolest thing ever in the sphere but it must be close read and marvel at the wonder
2352816 only a hotrod fanatic from the cornfields of iowa could concoct such a literary masterpiece
2352817 should be put in the national archives next to the declaration of independence in the special nuclear bomb proof case funniest thing ive ever read
2352818 this is the funniest material i have ever read on the internet
2352819 im on the board of a literary magazine at a small state university and at the boards meeting this spring the editor mentioned that he had wanted to reprint the blogger iowahawks hilarious swipe at the archbishop of canterbury unfortunately the editor said the magazine couldnt do reprint it the legal adviser from the universitys administration had said no not on the grounds that it was offensive to anglicans and their archbishop but on the grounds that it mentioned islam and the school could receive bomb threats as a result of publishing it
2352820 good thing that iowahawk exists otherwise wed have to invent him
2352821 you almost cant parody this mess but iowahawk can and does so again brilliantly

2352835 estamos visitando algunos de los pa ses que el che guevara recorri en su viaje en motocicleta por am rica latina deseamos informar sobre la situaci n social y pol tica de la regi n en nuestro pa s queremos hablar con trabajadores y activistas sociales y con personas involucradas en distintas luchas ahora en primer lugar hacemos manifiesta nuestra solidaridad con la documentalista elena varela y apoyamos la campa a por su liberaci n exigimos la inmediata liberaci n de elena varela y la devoluci n de todo su material f lmico tambi n deseamos expresar nuestra solidaridad con la lucha del pueblo mapuche por la tierra y por la justicia durante muchos a os el partido socialista irland s ha participado en muchas campa as y batallas hace cinco a os cuando era diputado en el parlamento irland s pas un mes en prisi n por muchos siglos el pueblo irland s ha luchado fuertemente contra el imperialismo como los mapuche y los pueblos originarios en toda latinoam rica
2352836 en irlanda la gente le tiene un gran respeto al che por su consecuencia de lucha por su relevante papel en la revoluci n cubana porque muri en bolivia manteniendo sus principios y jam s se corrompi especialmente entre los j venes el che es una figura muy respetada cada a o en irlanda se organiza una manifestaci n por la muerte del che el 2007 asistieron 200 j venes lo que para un tema que pudiera parecer tan distante es mucha gente pol ticamente nosotros pensamos que fue un error del che tratar de replicar en bolivia la idea del foco guerrillero y que m s bien hubiera sido preferible e interesante que se hubiera involucrado con las organizaciones de la clase obrera boliviana especialmente con los mineros
2352837 hace 10 a os hab a en irlanda un gran crecimiento eran los primeros tiempos del neoliberalismo en nuestro pa s no obstante ahora existe una gran crisis econ mica el gobierno irland s actual es de derecha y su pol tica neoliberal es muy parecida a la chilena pero creo que ahora las cosas van a cambiar mucho sobre todo en los a os venideros porque las condiciones de los j venes y trabajadores sufrir n importantes modificaciones
2352838 en irlanda tenemos un gran problema porque los dirigentes de los sindicatos tienen acuerdos con el gobierno y con los patrones los dirigentes no quieren luchar contra el neoliberalismo en realidad el partido laborista por ejemplo que en la actualidad se encuentra en la oposici n se ha convertido en un partido capitalista es decir que el pueblo irland s necesita un nuevo partido para los trabajadores pero no es f cil la tarea sin embargo yo creo que es nuestra responsabilidad procurar la creaci n de un nuevo instrumento pol tico con el fin de vehicular la lucha de los j venes y los trabajadores contra el neoliberalismo
2352839 yo fui diputado de la rep blica desde 1997 hasta el 2007 all fui el nico diputado del partido socialista los dem s parlamentarios de los llamados partidos de oposici n no lo eran realmente entonces yo levant una oposici n muy fuerte contra la pol tica neoliberal del gobierno apoyando la lucha de los trabajadores y por eso soy conocido en el pa s
2352840 hace 5 a os ten amos una campa a contra un impuesto por la recolecci n de la basura dom stica que ya estaba pagada por el impuesto global as que era una doble imposici n para nosotros era el primer cap tulo de una serie de impuestos subsiguientes a los servicios p blicos organizamos protestas y manifestaciones hasta que a trav s de una orden judicial se me emplaz a terminar con la agitaci n en torno al impuesto pero nos negamos a terminar las movilizaciones lo que me cost un mes de presidio
2352841 la explotaci n de trabajadores extranjeros en irlanda en un gran problema los inmigrantes provienen de los pa ses del este europeo debido a ello luchamos contra su explotaci n y hace 3 a os hubo un gran esc ndalo al respecto mil trabajadores de turqu a laboraban en el rea de la construcci n en p simas condiciones la explotaci n ocurr a de manera soterrada y conseguimos que 600 obreros votaran la huelga de esta manera con los trabajadores irlandeses y mi situaci n en el parlamento conseguimos 30 millones de euros de la compa a para los trabajadores
2352842 todo ha sido muy dif cil el pr ximo a o hay elecciones municipales y esperamos reunir en la campa a muchas iniciativas y luchas pero todav a no sabemos qu pasar yo pienso volver a participar en las elecciones parlamentarias
2352843 en irlanda el neoliberalismo se expresa a trav s de una mayor explotaci n de los trabajadores sobre los que cae una gran presi n hoy se est atacando el mbito de la pensi n y la extensi n de la jornada laboral de hecho ahora en irlanda mientras vivimos la primera ola de la recesi n los patrones quieren imponer un congelamiento salarial
2352844 la inmensa mayor a de la educaci n escolar y universitaria es de propiedad estatal hay algunos colegios privados pero s lo son para los m s ricos no es nada similar al caso chileno sin embargo hoy el gobierno ya est hablando de recortes de presupuesto para el sector
2352845 en la salud hay muchos problemas no hay recursos suficientes y el gobierno pretende privatizar sectores del servicio a trav s de contratos a empresas norteamericanas que est n construyendo nuevos hospitales
2352846 en el tema previsional los trabajadores del estado tienen pensiones p blicas y los trabajadores privados tienen pensiones privadas de todos modos al cumplir 66 a os de edad todos los trabajadores reciben una pensi n fiscal no es muy grande pero si la gente mayor no tiene que pagar alquiler o hipotecas alcanza para vivir en todo caso es muy caro vivir en irlanda los precios son muy altos comprar una casa para los j venes es casi imposible en los 10 ltimos a os las casas para los trabajadores han aumentado su precio 4 veces los padres de los j venes irlandeses de la actualidad ten an hipotecas por 20 a os ahora la duraci n de las hipotecas para los j venes llega a los 40 a os debido a la especulaci n auspiciada por el gobierno
2352847 es obvio advertir en chile que la vida es muy dif cil para mucha gente
2352848 s es posible el socialismo en irlanda hoy se est n viviendo grandes cambios mundiales debido a la crisis de origen norteamericano los trabajadores y los j venes est n pensando seriamente en la nueva situaci n econ mica y creo que en este sentido la conciencia va a cambiar es decir que habr mejores oportunidades para los socialistas para construir un nuevo movimiento lo mismo pienso que ocurrir en otros pa ses de europa

2352851 were going to invest in more ways than we have before
2352852 weve got two new developer account managers dedicated to europe which weve never had before to really work hand in glove with developers across the whole suite of different size and shape companies in the territory today
2352853 an obligation to all of us to have a good talent strategy
2352854 we have to grow new talent in the industry our investment and the upcoming community games channel is us supporting the industry as we know you have to bring talent through
2352855 its really difficult today for new developers to break through and for them to get people to look at their games and its really difficult once someone has looked at a game to give them access to sell that game on
2352856 please dont interrupt while i am speaking as we are from this point onward peers in the family of nations i hope you have reviewed the diplomatic instruments we sent by courier last night to department of state which delineates the terms of our divorce
2352857 i did receive those and you have no earthly idea the can of whoop
2352858 please sir maintain the decorum of these proceedings so we can move forward to an amicable separation i give you my personal assurance on the safety and well being of all federal personnel we have detained for immediate repatriation to the remainder of these united states any non law enforcement federal personnel who wish to remain behind will be permitted to do so
2352859 i hope you have thought through the consequences of what you are embarking on
2352860 mr president we have had over two hundred years to give the rulers on the potomac a chance but that time has expired effective immediately all so called federal lands now belong to the nation of idaho and we will dispose of these lands at our leisure in the interest of burying the hatchet we will not seek compensation for the seizure abuse and tenure of federal practices on the aforementioned land and call the balance even
2352861 in actuality they belong to neither of us sir on to other business i have alerted my national guard forces to establish checkpoints at all the main arterials in and out of idaho all national guard forces deployed overseas will return home in the next 48 hours i would also caution you on the use of military force to convince idaho and its citizens to forcibly return to the yoke of the union idaho has a well deserved reputation as a rather well equipped state in firearms possession and use as yamamoto said you may find a rifle behind every blade of grass
2352862 no sir i am simply making an observation about the hazards of one country invading another
2352863 you are land locked governor and wholly dependent on federal subsidy for a great deal of employment and infrastructure in idaho
2352864 no longer the tremendous tax burden across the spectrum formally imposed in our nation as a subject state in your country is now effectively terminated and we are going to unleash the free market to address all of our former shortcomings as a result of the overarching government supremacism practiced here before in telephone conversations with my neighboring governors we are on the verge of confederation negotiations that will pave the way for idaho embassies in british columbia montana utah and wyoming we do intend on opening a consular office in dc as soon as we can ensure the diplomatic baggage containing sufficient weapons assures our safety in the greater dc metropolitan area for our diplomatic personnel
2352865 governor what constitutional right do you have to secede from the us
2352866 mr president the behavior you have exhibited toward the constitution has been at best characterized by active neglect and abhorrence for the restraint on governance in the bill of rights i am rather surprised you would resort to assuming the document in any way has weight in washington dc i would suggest my rights extend as far as our ability to throw off what has become a government of occupation instead of cooperation we resign sir and wish to go in peace
2352867 i will use every measure in my arsenal to force you back into the fold
2352868 4 5 billion years in pro jail org inmate search
2352869 youre just petty politicians whod sooner sign onto the wisdom of a tyrant in another country than the demands of ticked off voters in your own
2352870 the point i made and ill make it again is that al qaeda functions on the basis that they think they can break our will thats their fundamental underlying strategy that if they can kill enough americans or cause enough havoc create enough chaos in iraq then well quit and go home and my statement was that if we adopt the pelosi policy that then we will validate the strategy of al qaeda i said it and i meant it
2352871 a political party cannot be all things to all people it must represent certain fundamental beliefs which must not be compromised to political expediency or simply to swell its numbers
2352872 oh no first of all if i took one vote away from a serious candidate it would be a sin
2352873 life was a game to him and he played it by his own rules
2352874 would you be able to set aside your own reading of the constitution the judges past instructions and judge the facts based solely upon the judges explanation of the law
2352875 other than the actual words that are written in the constitution what words would you have me substitute when i think of the constitution
2352876 it means just what i chose it to mean neither more nor less
2352877 whether you can make words mean so many different things
2352878 the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is
2352879 not free to determine any constitutional questions about the law
2352880 juries have established district courts authority to say what the law is
2352881 no citizen is above the law and none is free to make his own law
2352882 like the bread on a sandwich rice patties can hold just about anything in between for vegetarians rice burgers are a godsend since fast food chains in japan often serve them with only saut ed veggies in between
2352883 were you able to pick it up and eat it just like bread
2352884 the rice held together good although i did eat the tofurkey first and then the buns
2352885 in terms of what hes saying about me i dont think its necessarily centralisation but its certainly about becoming more professional
2352886 there was a time when i first joined the party when people questioned whether elections should be the focus of our activity if you join a party youre saying you want a party political response to the challenges weve got
2352887 i think the party will always have roots in broader political actions its perfectly legitimate for politicians to engage in peaceful activism i see myself very much as an activist as well as a politician we want people to see us as politicians in a broader sense rather than just men in grey suits
2352888 id say radical progressive weve been pigeon holed into just being a party of the environment too much weve put social justice at the heart of our record weve been going out to the unions in recent years to communicate to them there is a party with the record they are looking for and its not the labour party
2352889 their industries are under threat from climate change not environmentalism
2352890 the green party has a clear message the transition from high to low carbon economy has to have workers in the forefront of it
2352891 given it has to happen one way or another it can either be forced on us or we can manage it in the best way obviously its frightening to realise your industry will change but a post carbon economy will need lots of skills and human power so its very good news for a lot of workers these industries will be more labour intensive than the fossil fuels they are set to replace
2352892 well concentrate on brighton pavilion norwich south and lewisham were already putting together the most professional campaigns weve ever had we can build on that
2352893 our turn around experts recommended this action in order to help us survive in a difficult economic time for the heath care industry while it is a hard decision we recognize the need and will follow their recommendation
2352894 when that occurs we will staff up again we hate to lose these fine people but it doesnt make fiscal sense to keep them on under the current circumstances
2352895 we are ready to move quickly once the approval process is complete
2352896 this will benefit the bank by lowering our perceived risk profile
2352897 their goal of getting more capital has to be no 1 priority
2352898 and a need for 400 million may turn into 500 million but if anybody could do it it s the largest bank in florida
2352899 although our numbers continue to be impacted by the difficult mortgage cycle our core bank continues to perform well
2352900 deposits and commercial activities are growing at a prudent pace despite the challenges in the economy
2352901 we are urging an immediate ceasefire in the fighting in south ossetia and for a resumption in direct dialogue between all parties
2352902 we need a ceasefire and urgent negotiations to stop the military action escalating
2352903 there is now real danger of an all out conflict between russian and georgian troops
2352904 there is also the risk of abkhazia raising the stakes by cutting vital hydro electricity supplies to georgia
2352905 the un must put pressure on russia to pull back from the brink if the russians can show restraint they will surely be well placed to offer negotiations
2352906 bloodshed in south ossetia will be on their conscience we will protect our peacekeepers and citizens of the russian federation
2352907 there are two kinds of visual memory one when you skillfully recreate an image in the laboratory of your mind with your eyes open
2352908 what if there were those in this universe who considered death a gift from heaven
2352909 my government blew through my doors and killed my dogs
2352910 they thought we were drug dealers and we were treated as such i dont think they really ever considered that we werent
2352911 were not in the habit of going to homes and shooting peoples dogs
2352912 if we were there would be a lot more dead dogs around the county
2352913 you cant tell me the chief of police of a municipality wouldnt have been able to knock on the door of the mayor of that municipality gain his confidence and enter the residence
2352914 a review of the warrant indicates that police neither sought nor received permission from circuit court judge albert w northrup to enter without knocking
2352915 northrup found probable cause to suspect that drugs might be in the house and granted police a standard search warrant
2352916 taking a more strategic approach a cybercriminal wanting to scam another cybercriminal would backdoor then start distributing it for free and in fact there have been numerous cases when such kits have been distributed in such a fraudulent manner the result is a total outsourcing of the process of coming up with ways to infect hundreds of thousands of users though client side exploits and basically collecting the final output the stolen e banking data and the botnet itself
2352917 my grace is sufficient for you my power is made perfect in weakness
2352918 i am so lucky jamie has given me this gift
2352919 it makes it hard for me to complain about anything
2352920 i know i have the body of a weak and feeble woman but i have the heart and stomach of a king and a king of england too
2352921 mona lisa shed look better with a mustache dont you think
2352922 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2352923 we deplore the russian military action in georgia which is a violation of georgian sovereignty and territorial integrity
2352924 the deputy secretary said that we deplore todays russian attacks by strategic bombers and missiles which are threatening civilian lives
2352925 weve got the closure we needed to justify the fact that my mother didnt have to die
2352926 we intend to appeal and are confident that the verdict will be set aside
2352927 were going to be there because its important for people to understand that there is a tragic human consequence to the criminal conduct of gary trebert
2352928 a handkerchief of hard news soaked in a sneeze of thought snot
2352929 theoretically oversized human breasts evolved to encourage face to face mating i find faces a pretty good spur for this kind of thing
2352930 large breasts are considered sexy because they signal certain things about the woman
2352931 2006 begick jag ett allvarligt omd mesl st misstag och uppf rde mig illojalt mot min familj och mot min innersta vertygelse
2352932 inf r min familj tog jag ansvar f r mina handlingar 2006 och i dag tar jag offentligt mitt fulla ansvar
2352933 it was spectacular really unbelievable we liked it a lot
2352934 the heavy presence of chinese peoples liberation army officers throughout the proceedings left many wondering exactly what image the hosts were intending to project to the international community
2352935 we have enough boxers for one two or three teams
2352936 this is the toughest course i have ever seen at a tournament event
2352937 its good to see public acknowledgment that our story was accurate all along
2352938 probably the biggest question about this whole mess is why the mainstream media protected edwards by ignoring the story for the past 8 months
2352939 i think its entirely appropriate for a news organization to wait to report a story until they have information that theyre comfortable with reporting
2352940 all i can say is that were not in the business of printing things we dont know to be true
2352941 the problem with a story like this is that its very very difficult to ascertain the truth until one of the people steps forward
2352942 the national enquirer is a supermarket tabloid that is accurate some of the time and inaccurate some of the time
2352943 it was the subject of late night talk shows and certainly all over the web
2352944 it was in our culture and in our faces and to act as if it didnt exist would be to ignore reality
2352945 live your life in such a way that when you open your eyes in the morning satan says oh no shes awake
2352946 made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family
2352947 may allow airports to ban firearms from terminals parking lots roads and other airport areas where many states currently allow passengers to carry
2352948 with help from a substantial decline in crude oil and a surge in the dollar the dow jones industrial average is up 300 points in afternoon trading
2352949 after that the stock seemed to run out of gas and has seen sluggish trading friday afternoon
2352950 at 10 93 a share rax is trading 12 6 percent below its ipo price of 12 50 a share
2352951 todays lukewarm results from the rackspace ipo arent likely to help
2352952 there still doesnt seem to be a lot of investor interest in the ipo market and that in turn isnt likely to motivate other companies to bring many more deals to the market in the short term
2352953 you have to be a strong company to get out in this market
2352954 it is clearly a brutal market environment with tremendous uncertainty around the economy in general and it spending in particular
2352955 rackspace came out at the bottom end of the range and still traded down that is not much incentive for future ipo investors buying in and then registering a loss within an hour
2352956 i can tell you that there are a lot of quality companies waiting in the wings for the economy to improve
2352957 how beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news
2352958 we deplore the russian military action in georgia which is a violation of georgian sovereignty and territorial integrity
2352959 if the whole world does not stop russia today then russian tanks will be able to reach any other european capital
2352960 he is in big danger of losing the cachet he built up for himself in being pro western and the restraint he has often shown in the face of provocation by russia
2352961 what russia is doing in georgia is open undisguised aggression and a challenge to the whole world
2352962 we can easily say ive seen most of that data before i dont have to send it again
2352963 it feels to the guys in new york like the application is in new york
2352964 if it looks like a duck quacks like a duck and walks like a duck it is a duck
2352965 state local tax burdens dip as income growth outpaces tax growth
2352966 the most effective weapon against a political opponent is humor especially mocking
2352967 when it gets picked up by late night comedians it becomes part of the mainstream and reaches even more voters more effectively
2352968 to a certain extent the ads are having some effect
2352969 not supporting me is equivalent to forfeiting your own rights
2352970 the existing contract that was extended last weekend will expire and a strike action is possible
2352971 a couple of critical issues are unresolved and we have until midnight sunday to fix it
2352972 a little surprising because weve been doing some very intense fully engaged negotiations with them all along we continue to negotiate
2352973 it seems to be a matter of resolving some issues and making good progress with others well see what the weekend brings we are committed to being in negotiations until we get an agreement
2352974 as technologies and industries change more quickly in telecommunications the nature of the work changes so people should have the ability and opportunity to move into jobs of the future regarding the fios buildout right now some of those jobs are being contracted out wherever technology takes us i think its important for the people who make companies successful to know theyll have that success too
2352975 the unions recognize that verizon is making more progress in deploying next generation technologies than anyone else in the country
2352976 the workers here are learning that technology and developing job skills that will serve them for a long time to come if we dont do anything and everybody moves to the cable company phone and internet technologies thats not going to be a happy situation for any of us including the unions
2352977 to say essentially to your ceo that the measure we have for your success is maintaining this deployment schedule for this key technology thats a really fundamental statement about how important that is to verizon going forward
2352978 my expectation is well continue to do this for a while and reach a contract that everybody agrees is the right balance and there wont be any customer impact at all
2352979 all working people in the u s have a real big stake in the outcome of these talks
2352980 whenever such a large number of workers push back and insist on corporate america doing the right thing thats good for everybody
2352981 das spanische radteam musste hier bereits acht dopingkontrollen in zwei tagen absolvieren stehen unsere fahrer in peking unter einem besonderen verdacht
2352982 schon mal was von fuentes geh rt ist euer ber chtigter blutdoktor in madrid oder von der operacion puerto betrifft mehr als 50 radprofis wurde aber von der justiz in spanien niedergeschlagen oder von den 200 blutbeuteln die dort liegen und keiner geht mit dna tests ran und
2352983 wir machen hier 4500 dopingtests das trifft eben viele athleten
2352984 ich bin nicht euphorisch habe viel respekt vor diesem kurs

2352986 me comport de una manera desleal a mi familia y mis principios fundamentales reconoc mi error y le dije a mi esposa que tuve una relaci n con otra mujer y le ped perd n
2352987 estuve y estoy avergonzado de mi conducta y de mis decisiones y tuve la esperanza de que no saliera a la luz p blica tom responsabilidad de mis acciones en el 2006 con mi familia y hoy lo hago en p blico

2352989 si quieren atacarme si ntanse libre no podr n hacerlo m s de lo que lo he hecho yo mismo he quedado totalmente al descubierto y ahora trabajar con todo lo que tengo para ayudar a mi familia y a otros que necesiten mi ayuda
2352990 he decided he wanted to produce his assignment as a web site with a little coaching i convinced him to look at googles and ebays services and have a little fun placing banner ads on his homework using the google and ebay web apis which support simple rest urls he was able to easily cut and paste the code needed without really understanding what the code did into his assignment and presto he was linked into both googles and ebays powerful soas several months later he has made over 5 on his homework from ad revenue this is a real motivator to do homework
2352991 by going the woa plus rest route instead of soa plus soap the requirements for extending the application dropped considerably
2352992 there is no soap processing stack with complicated wsdl documents an soa registry and what have you instead someone can easily create an extension to deki wiki using any number of computer languages
2352993 thus far i have interviewed only one company that i would classify as a soa success story
2352994 the picture or figure is in itself the body whereas its signification is the soul of the image
2352995 showed how easily an organization dedicated to intelligence can fail to give much evidence of it
2352996 the thing that hath been it is that which shall be and that which is done is that which shall be done you
2352997 somebody was laying on my legs a lady next to me she had her arm crushed up the lady who was on my left a man was on top of her
2352998 i think im the luckiest one out of most people
2352999 if there is a loss of pressure or the tire becomes delaminated its much more difficult to control the vehicle
2353000 we have requested law enforcement agencies to be alert for any buses being operated by angel tours or iguala busmex since they are not authorized to operate legally
2353001 if found on the road we want law enforcement to immediately stop and place the vehicles out of service
2353002 this happened like katrina like challenger what we can do is pray
2353003 god will comfort them tell people to keep trusting in god do not blame anybody do not ask why now we just help each other to get through this
2353004 the church is like one big family here were very close we stick together
2353005 we are here with them to pray for those who are lost and for gods consolation in this time of grief and loss
2353006 the vietnamese catholic culture is very strong a lot of those who have come here have been through a great deal just to get to this country theyve always preserved their catholic faith this is a trial this is a challenge
2353007 part of the old tired politics of a party in washington that has run out of ideas and run out of steam
2353008 like it would have crossed our minds to let up on the guy just because hes on vacation
2353009 it literally is the same old democratic consultant driven politics
2353010 its the same attempt not to tell a story about the country and the other guy but to prove youre right like an academic debating seminar
2353011 120 million social network profiles total were found with each person averaging 2 3 social networks women and the 14 24 year old demographic are more likely to use myspace and facebook than other demographics the 14 24 year old demographic represents 65 5 and 66 25 of total users respectively men and the 25 34 year old demographic are more likely to use linkedin and flickr than other demographics the 25 34 year old demographic represents 51 0 and 38 1 of total users respectively
2353012 no involvement in her placement in the home of donna irving and warren johnson
2353013 justice paulseth appears to have dealt with this matter in an overly casual and cavalier manner
2353014 an alarming absence of any consideration of the best interests of katelynn sampson
2353015 i think in this case it might have been deliberate but please appreciate that thats speculation on my part
2353016 the court system made an assumption that everybody was healthy and thats a dangerous assumption
2353017 had an agency that had knowledge about the best interests of children and the quality of family life been looking at that family that custody would not have been smooth
2353018 so it wont necessarily mean at the end of the day these children will be better protected
2353019 its not a judgment for us to make everyones entitled to assistance in court
2353020 the ultimate determination of someones fitness ultimately rests with the judge
2353021 if there is a loss of air pressure or delamination of the tire its much more difficult to control the vehicle
2353022 will introduce the unprecedented element of selectively weaving spanish throughout both the book and songs
2353023 it wasnt until mid 2000 an algorithm was developed that bots could even come close to a competent player but now online computer poker playing may become a thing of the past
2353024 other times its like im not only sitting at my desk im also a few feet away watching me
2353025 ever since they started calling back the people in the bacteriology division for polygraphs they all sort of got quiet about things
2353026 well as propellers programming manager and the one who runs the aforementioned scout team i can say these reports are being blown a little out of proportion we did let a few scouts go but it was 4 out of about 35 so that fraction we were reduced to is roughly 9 10ths
2353027 rather than reduce the pay rate of management propeller has simply downsized its more expendable content control team
2353028 as with any product used to excess consumers often wonder about the health consequences of caffeine
2353029 we cant even have a decent meal because of the olympics
2353030 do those foreigners who are coming to beijing for the games get to eat vegetables
2353031 i heard that the foreign athletes will have vegetables cultivated especially for them which were not irrigated with water but with milk or soy milk
2353032 i guess thats in order to host a safe olympics but i think they killed the fun
2353033 do not stay on the same bus on the same train on the same plane in the same buildings or any place the chinese are
2353034 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents and human rights advocates and religious activists
2353035 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
2353036 originally the olympic games were just that games but this game has become so heavily guarded that its really gone over the top
2353037 government officials should do a little self examination why are they so afraid its impossible to tell if theyre afraid of terrorist organizations or of the public
2353038 they shouldnt use this as an excuse to become even more oppressive if people dont have the space to express the grievances they will be driven to support more extreme means of demonstrating their discontent
2353039 it could be that when the games start everybody forgets everything and its all about the glory of sport
2353040 i hope that thats the case but there are a number of issues whether its tibet pollution falun gong doping we dont know whether those issues are going to emerge but they could and then take on a life of their own
2353041 ive learned a lot become a better professional and a better man because of my experience and my time in new york i dont regret or feel ashamed about anything that happened to me in my time in new york
2353042 the most difficult part is just the realization that the organization no longer wants you
2353043 you spend eight years there and in the blink of an eye youre no longer wanted there
2353044 its a little odd to play against a group of individuals that ive been so close to for so long its like playing in the backyard with your family so its different that way
2353045 but you know you got to separate and move on
2353046 thats what its all about having fun the guy thats pitching over there is a great friend of mine
2353047 hes been a good player his whole career he had a good day today i didnt notice anything and nobody said anything to me about it
2353048 if you look around everybody gets excited when they do great thats just the way the game is today
2353049 thats why we call it a team at some point in the season all 25 count
2353050 i know what my job is i just got to stay ready when they need me
2353051 he didnt leave me a whole lot of plate but i thought i might have snuck my hand in there when he called me out he had a pretty good view of it

2353063 christ died a horrible death so we would never have to see satan and now we are playing with him
2353064 i threw the ball a lot better than the linescore said
2353065 i just really got outpitched theres nothing really more to say
2353066 that last start i was trying to get out alive
2353067 i didnt care if i gave up 100 runs that game i was so beat out there i was so exhausted out there
2353068 he was attacking the zone with like nine pitches it seemed like
2353069 i think a j was not hustling on the play
2353070 he hit the ball and pretty much thought it was out of play
2353071 when i hit it and drew caught it i didnt know where it went

2353080 the pot whale differs from the ordinary whale inasmuch as it defends itself with much vigour against its assailants and sometimes succeeds in dangerously damaging and occasionally sinking the boats containing its pursuers this is not astonishing when we consider that these whales measure from 25 to 35 yards in length and some 13 to 14 yards around the body the above illustration shows one of these pot whales stranded by a storm very soon ice foxes assemble in great numbers and fight for the most delicate portions of the body until whole monster is totally devoured these foxes have the peculiarity of being quite brown in summer whilst they turn grey or white in winter

2353104 great times call for great men ha ek explains in a brief ironic preface but goes on to state that the great are the reverse of those who act with the precise intention of having their names in the history books he describes his hero vejk as heroic and valiant but vejk performs no actions which those two words are typically used to describe it becomes clear that ha ek by means of his enigmatic hero is attempting to redefine certain key values vejk comes to be seen as a good soldier in political rather than military terms because his stubborn incompetence has the effect of destabilizing and exposing the absurdities of imperial rule the implication is that the form of political disruption adopted by people like vejk complete resistance which takes the form of utter compliance has been instrumental in the post war liberation of the czechoslovak people after four centuries of imperial domination there is a curious contradiction then between the imputed historical importance of vejks actions and the seeming imbecility of those actions themselves the problem is resolved if we remind ourselves that vejk is not a conscious political actor the historical effect of his actions has nothing to do with a wish on his part to be historically effective vejks main motive is personal survival but the wish to stay alive is by definition counter to the armys need for willing cannon fodder vejk is thus a thoroughly destructive spanner in the works nothing proceeds smoothly when he is present even the story of which he is the hero cannot progress because he keeps dragging it down the cul de sacs of his interminable anecdotes

2353175 the georgian president has tried to push the matter into a military solution of eliminating the biggest stumbling block to nato membership

2353177 the georgina gamble was to overrun south ossetia quickly so they could establish forces on the ground
2353178 georgia fired the first shot but will claim that they were driven to it by the skirmishes that have been taking place on a daily basis over the past few weeks

2353203 lenders say the position here is not as bad as in england and wales mortgage affordability is better because house prices are lower against incomes compared with the south of the border a lot of the adverse credit sector is also focused on london and the south east

2353208 when the peoples republic of china was announced coming into the stadium in los angeles it changed our games
2353209 ninety thousand people stood and cheered from all parts of the world they were welcoming china into the olympic movement
2353210 they will mean a lot for the rest of the world to discover what china really is to discover a country which for most people is mysterious
2353211 they will see a country with a history and a tradition and a culture of 5 000 years
2353212 i clearly expect them to be the dominant team in the olympic games for many many years to come
2353213 this is not just investing in a few athletes for a short period of time and hope they have success while you host the games the results of this type of investment and this type of system is going to garner them results in 2012 2016 and beyond

2353216 without shared experiences a heterogeneous society will have a more difficult time addressing social problems and understanding one another
2353217 no i just showed up im not sure what i was thinking i mean theres stuff i want to talk about i guess but i dont know why i didnt call first to make an appointment
2353218 i thought i should just come at the usual time
2353219 you can discuss that with dr cervantes later if you like
2353220 yeah that would be okay i dont go into work until 3 00
2353221 the first thing i want to say is that im not sure i can afford to keep coming here week after week id like to be able to check in every once in awhile i think but every week is probably just too much money im working now and i make just enough to pay for rent and food and basic stuff like that im not sure how im going to pay for clothes and the car and other things im used to having
2353222 and of course weve discussed other kinds of therapy before
2353223 yeah well not for mom which i think is what youre thinking im working at a video store videosyncracy 25 to 30 hours a week
2353224 so youve done what you said you were going to do a few months ago
2353225 i moved in with a couple a little older than i am just ten minutes from home on eastlake it was through her the girl that i got the job
2353226 all this happened the same week i left that is the last time i saw you
2353227 i dont think ive ever told you much about my dreams but sometimes theyre pretty weird
2353228 i had one a couple of nights ago that took place here right in this office
2353229 there was the potters wheel from home i mean a potters wheel from my parents place was here in the office
2353230 we were working on a piece together and both our hands were on it at the same time
2353231 they werent touching though our hands that is i wouldnt want you to get the wrong idea
2353232 anyway the piece was a vase a big vase about like this
2353233 not like that or maybe it was like that but thats not the point
2353234 the main thing was that the vase was already partly filled with water not a lot of water but a little but it kept getting mixed in with the clay and then the whole statue vase i mean the whole vase would turn to liquid and collapse
2353235 i think we started up the wheel once or twice more but we werent really able to get started wed get the vase built up halfway or even very nearly complete but then it would just fall apart and then the wheel would stop
2353236 i think that you moving to the other chair is a sign that i want to work with you more closely for one thing although what i said earlier still stands about not being too sure about the money situation
2353237 im not exactly sure about the vase but its probably safe to say that its something sexual
2353238 although i still dont think i meant with you i mean that working on the pottery together was some way of talking about sex in the dream you know what i mean dont you
2353239 yes i think so we werent we were engaged in talking about sex and thats all
2353240 okay so what kinds of things were we saying or what would we have talked about if we had been talking
2353241 hes the guy ive been sleeping with for the last couple of months
2353242 yeah well anyway hes the owner and the manager of the place tweezer my roommate she warned me about getting involved with him hes married you see and i guess besides that hes been through a lot of women at the store so she like kinda thinks hes a jerk
2353243 well maybe hes a jerk but thats not the point
2353244 the thing is that it may be true but when she said that i sorda thought she was referring to me which is fine i havent been living with a guy for seven years unmarried like she has so i guess she can judge me all she wants but that still isnt the point
2353245 the point is that i kinda liked the fact that hes married and it doesnt really matter to me how many women hes slept with hes twice as old as i am for gods sake he could be my father
2353246 okay so maybe it is but my point was that there really is no point i wanted the experience and now ive had it
2353247 i dont like him as much as i thought i would some of it was fun i guess but its not like i like him all that much he can be kind of creepy
2353248 so thats part of it perhaps but why do you think this now
2353249 well its not exactly that hes a dog actually even though he is it has more to do with what he brings out of me
2353250 no thats not it at all he doesnt try to make me feel anything good in some ways actually its just that i feel like i go a little crazy around him
2353251 well a week or so we were over at my parents place dad i think you know has been down in la for almost a year now and now moms going down there as well chasing him or trying to reconcile or something since i moved out so the house is sitting there empty and i wanted to get a chair for my room at doug and tweezers
2353252 yeah anyway to make a long story short we ended up sleeping together in my parents bed
2353253 i think he was kind of surprised by that which is exactly what i wanted to do so you see he both brought it out of me and i tried to top him with by pulling a move i didnt think hed expect all at the same time
2353254 yes i did afterwards i felt kinda weird like id violated an inner sanctum
2353255 the point of it all is i think tom and mom were actually lovers back in college so yeah i guess thats what i was after
2353256 i mean that i think i understand your thinking this im not sure that its actually true
2353257 i overheard mom talking to a friend once and they were talking about this guy that ran the video store and how much hed changed since college mom changed the subject right away and something about the way she did it made me realize that she used to know him it was a total coincidence when i found out that the girl i live with works at the same store but i went and applied there anyway knowing that it might lead to something and tom must have known who i was i look a lot like my mom did at that age
2353258 i also found out a while ago that mom and dad had to get married they were in their last year at school together and all of a sudden they got married before graduating or anything
2353259 yeah but there was definitely something rushed about the way they did it
2353260 well i did a little hunting around moms always been pretty secretive about the wedding for example they never talk about their wedding anniversary
2353261 thats not necessarily unusual especially if theyve had problems over the years
2353262 maybe not but in their wedding album theres just pictures no invitations or anything giving a date
2353263 but the fact that there is an album suggests that it wasnt entirely a secret
2353264 no but when ive asked mom about the date shes always been strange she used to say about a year before you were born so you think or i thought 1984 that makes perfect sense but the wedding was in the fall of 1984
2353265 well once i heard her talking with one of her friends from college who said something about her secret engagement
2353266 no and now its just so obvious she got married before she finished school but by finishing school she doesnt mean graduated what she means even though she doesnt say it is that she left school in order to have me she never talks about graduating so what i think happened was that she got pregnant with me around the beginning of her junior year dad did the right thing and married her before she started showing which he could easily do because he was a year older they got formally engaged right after she found out she was pregnant with me but said that theyd been secretly engaged for three months and then got married two months later that made for a respectable engagement of six months mom always says six but it was really five and that itself is a cover for the fact that the whole thing was a rush job i dug out dads diploma from one of his files in the office he graduated in 1985 four months after i was born and eight months after they were married in october of 1984 mom always implies that dad was working when she had me but the fact is that he was just working to finish school shes always very vague about it and thats why shes never really had a job she just did the decorating and seamstress thing on the side and now shes trying to push it onto me
2353267 im just lucky i wasnt aborted i guess i can probably thank mom for that
2353268 okay so what does this mean for the big picture
2353269 it means that they never really wanted to get married but stuck it out because of me i wasnt exactly wanted either and thats why theyve had all these problems and now dad has finally left even though mom hasnt figured out how to deal with it
2353270 im a little more concerned with how youre dealing with it
2353271 im fine with it i call him up in la and he sends me money when i need it as long as i dont do it too much theres no problem i havent even figured out what too much is
2353272 not really hes got his own thing going on now and mom needs to figure that out now
2353273 so when we meet next week you can tell me about that
2353274 korrektiv s pithy and bold approach separates it from the blogospheric herd and the combination of poetry theology and opinion makes it unique you might not always agree with korrektiv but you cant ignore it
2353275 im a lance corporal in the marine corps stationed in mosel iraq between missions i dont have a lot of time to get caught up on the news someone from my group turned me on to korrektiv and i have to tell you that its become my one stop shop for news and opinion from back home thanks korrektiv

2353278 its the place where i feel like im with a family feel less lonely feel happier knowing that other people eating in their own little booths feel the same way too
2353279 sat down on a bench and he cried his fucking eyes out
2353280 cause maybe you dont have a lot of money and you live in a row house in a small street and sometimes the garbage and rubbish is all mixed up and scattered everywhere
2353281 taking care of the outside marble steps sweeping the street
2353282 and i never cried so long or so hard in all my life
2353283 at the window where my mother used to wave to me so many times when i returned to see her i could swear that i saw her face looking down at me now and waving and suddenly i smiled and waved back and whispered goodbye mom
2353284 what you need to know about mortgages and real estate and more
2353285 we could wrest the south american markets from germany and england and permanently hold them this would be indeed a conquest worth perhaps a heavy sacrifice
2353286 it behooves us to accept the commanding position among the power of the earth
2353287 we need and must have open markets throughout the world to maintain and increase our prosperity
2353288 the united states is practically sovereign on this continent and its fiat is law upon the subjects to which it confines its interposition
2353289 war for europe is meaning devastation and death for america a bumper crop of new millionaires and a hectic hastening of prosperity revival
2353290 we agreed that we should do all that was lawfully in our power to help the allies win the war as soon as possible
2353291 comes close to being an organ of what c wright mills has called the power elite a group of men similar in interest and outlook shaping events from invulnerable positions behind the scenes
2353292 i am arranging to see nelson rockefeller himself assistant secretary of state for inter american affairs during world war ii who knows the situation and can work a little with general eisenhower
2353293 let him johnson know that the establishment yes wall street had turned on the war it was hurting the economy dividing the country turning the youth against the countrys best traditions
2353294 the financial power elite can sleep well at night regardless of who wins in 1984
2353295 there is something behind the throne greater than the king himself
2353296 while a pure free market would necessarily prevent the development of a banking monopoly
2353297 specialized capital market by the very nature of its integrative role within the market system will emerge as a strategic locus of ultimate decision making
2353298 yo my name is lesby and im the best all the djs want to feel my breasts eh uh eh uh eh uh eh uh
2353299 theres no question that fannie and freddie are going to buy or guarantee a plus credit and that means anything a minus and below is going to go to the federal housing administration and the veterans administration
2353300 its safe to say that the fha wont be getting the cream of the crop and taxpayers will be on the hook
2353301 when you add in the fact that these are borrowers less than perfect credit which will lead to a rise in defaults we just dont know how big and how bad with this huge influx of business in this kind of environment
2353302 the exceptional sequence and scale of our drilling success in this area reflects the world class status of the pre salt santos basin
2353303 there needs to be big money put in but there is big money out provided you find a large oil structure
2353304 we are estimating iara to contain from 500 000 to one billion barrels but until bg group can confirm the size of the reserve it is impossible to put a hard number on the value of the find and even then it will be all about the timing of when it gets developed
2353305 rises in the oil price are not accompanied by a proportional rise in oil company profits
2353306 there is cost inflation in the industry and tax still gobbles up the same percentage as before
2353307 i dont know if im being naive but i dont feel that way
2353308 i have done a bunch of interviews and they are like were you nervous to throw the ball or let it loose
2353309 when we started throwing nobody was around it wasnt like it was april and guys are working out or may and we have minicamp and im trying to push it i didnt have to push it because nobody was there so that worked in my favor
2353310 it always hurt to practice but it just didnt feel right
2353311 i remember vividly talking to my wife on a friday afternoon and she asked how was practice and how is the arm i said it was miserable this week i dont know it was just miserable this week your body just tells you sometimes
2353312 it felt too good after i hurt myself it sounds stupid but i didnt have the pain
2353313 i didnt have the pain during the night or waking up in the morning i didnt have the pain of when i would grab certain things i didnt have that anymore that was more mentally refreshing than anything else
2353314 i think most players ive seen as you get older you realize your years might be numbered
2353315 im not saying jake is done anytime soon but i think he knows hes comfortable here hes enjoying it his elbow feels good and hes definitely having a lot of fun
2353316 this is my 12th nfl camp and im not going to 12 more
2353317 i enjoy it i like the guys on this team and i like the coaches i think most of the guys as they get older tend to enjoy it because you realize how blessed you are to play this game
2353318 initial reaction is that these are better than expected with a lower loss and higher core tier 1 capital
2353319 the shares offer value to investors with a longer term perspective
2353320 there isnt going to be a bid financial debt worries havent gone away and trading will worsen this autumn
2353321 it is a very serious case i cannot recall ever seeing let alone hearing of a situation where a police officer trying to serve a subpoena was assaulted
2353322 we are charging defendant kwame kilpatrick with assaulting police officers in the furtherance of their duties

2353329 i also have not been engaged in any activity of any description that requested agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby

2353331 began a long and painful process in 2006 a process oddly made somewhat easier with my cancer diagnosis in march of 2007
2353332 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2353333 i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness

2353357 i think arkansas will be a swing state and i think it will be a real challenge
2353358 the fact is obama supports that and i think that could be dangerous to the essence of democracy
2353359 we need to reach out to independents old and new what we used to call reagan democrats and some you might call clinton democrats as well
2353360 if john boozman and mike huckabee can transfer some of their popularity to my campaign then thank god for them
2353361 weve got a lot of work to do in this campaign and im the underdog my friends
2353362 there was a time before this time a year ago where most political pundits didnt think the former governor from a small southern state nor this guy from arizona whose campaign had imploded had much of a chance
2353363 i want you to know with the utmost sincerity he really was my second choice to be president of the united states
2353364 i think they see something in arkansas that puts some doubt in their minds clearly theres something sen mccain has seen in arkansas that makes him feel as though he needs to come here twice
2353365 the place and time of the invention of the cannon is unknown but its evolution from the fire lance among the turks arabs and europeans can hardly be doubted in 1304 edward i made no use of cannon at stirling although he ordered saltpetre for greek fire but by 1341 the castle was defended by the scots with guns edward built what is reputed the largest trebuchet ever made called war wolf for the 1304 siege of stirling which threw 300 pound stones the english fortress of la r ole in gascony fell after a months bombardment by cannon in 1324 guns are reported at cr cy in 1346 but in a minor role the venetians are said to have used cannon for a siege in 1380 as did alfonso xi about the same time against the moors in spain poudre canon is recorded in 1338 the osmanli turks used large cannon at the final siege of constantinople in 1453 by which date the innovation was widely known in the west the bombard of 3 ft calibre throwing a 600lb stone at constantinople seems very large for the time but apparently such large guns actually existed the last battle of the hundred years war at castillon in gascony in 1453 where john talbot earl of shrewsbury died was decided by 300 cannon commanded by jean bureau this was the first battle in which cannon were the deciding factor
2353366 ill be back in an hour are you boys sure you know what youre doing

2353377 shakespeare coloca la obra en el siglo v presenta la atenas en crisis no la deslumbrante de tiempos anteriores
2353378 recog este texto para hablar sobre la traici n la amistad los sue os y sobre lo que significa el dinero en la sociedad es un texto que se podr a calificar de antisistema que critica el sistema capitalista y que habla de algo fundamental como son las traiciones
2353379 nunca pens que mis pelotas pudieran provocar un rompimiento de esa relaci n amorosa tan bonita que hab a con el p blico en ese momento pero la potencia de estas piedras juegan estas malas pasadas tambi n al p blico el espect culo ha tenido para m dos partes diferenciadas muy claras
2353380 hemos luchado contra viento y marea con todas las dificultades pero nunca se sabe por d nde te llega la sorpresa en el arte a veces lo accidentado provoca hallazgos y esto no lo olvidar en mi vida
2353381 tim n no es un personaje de tragedia pero cuando busca la soledad para alimentar el odio contra la propia naturaleza humana se puede ver as
2353382 hay una primera parte en la obra en la que el poder del dinero y su papel en la econom a en un sentido amplio es el tema central y una segunda centrada absolutamente en el propio sentido de la existencia humana
2353383 de mi imaginaci n ya que shakespeare no retira a tim n a un desierto sino a una cueva en la que encuentra oro pero quise hacer un homenaje a bu uel con su sim n del desierto y en esa segunda parte surrealista y simb lica surgi el petr leo como elemento que justifique lo que encuentra tim n en su retiro
2353384 quise dar un peque o viraje marcando la versi n con elementos religiosos tim n tambi n proyecta discursos ticos sobre el mundo
2353385 quien beba de este vino y coma de este pan ser mi amigo para siempre
2353386 no se pueden comparar los dos montajes han pasado treinta a os brook entonces se centr m s en los aspectos filos ficos de la obra mientras que aqu el asunto gira en torno a la idea de actualidad y contemporaneidad del texto
2353387 mi madre de peque o me llamaba panoli y creo que en el fondo esta es la historia de la inmolaci n in til de un panoli enfurru ado algo que he discutido mucho y en buenos t rminos con el director
2353388 lucha mucho por su trabajo derrocha inteligencia para organizar el espect culo y hacerlo lo mejor posible todo con el objetivo de que el p blico sienta que los que hacemos este trabajo lo amamos lo cierto es que nuestra meta ser a que los padres de familia salgan de la representaci n pensando voy a decirle a mi hijo que estudie teatro porque si los ni os estudiaran teatro y no se les hurtara este bien com n estoy convencido que tendr amos mejores ciudadanos y mejores personas
2353389 nos hace reflexionar no sobre la condici n humana que eso siempre se da en shakespeare sino sobre un problema que es de terrible actualidad como es el considerar el dinero un valor primordial en nuestra sociedad adem s en la segunda parte se reflexiona sobre algo esencial como es el comportamiento social de la naturaleza humana
2353390 y de todos los temas que afronta elijo el del aprendizaje cualquiera de nosotros tiene dificultades enormes para pasar del estado de ignorancia al de conocimiento hay una enorme resistencia y lamentablemente el ser humano de manera natural elige primero la aberraci n aqu lo que nos interesa de tim n es su equivocaci n en la que nos reflejamos pero de lo que se trata es de que tengamos esperanza de construir un mundo mejor porque el que tenemos es brutal
2353391 ojala ocurriera y yo desarrollara m s la capacidad que todo hombre tiene de ser un antih roe me interesa mucho meterme en la piel de seres humanos llenos de contradicciones capaces de cometer tremendas equivocaciones ah es donde la vida se revela como misteriosa y sorprendente y de eso siempre tenemos que aprender todos queremos tener seguridad pero sta es una palabra maldita porque est suplantando a la libertad que es un ejercicio permanente y yo elijo ser un antih roe
2353392 we will not support you in any way or under any circumstances
2353393 id rather have it and not need it than need it and not have it
2353394 the main thing putting a fire under the market is that crude oil prices continue to come down that is lifting everything that is not in the energy patch
2353395 we would not be surprised if over the next few weeks the dollar resumed its extended period of depreciation
2353396 there is a perception that when you compare the u s economy to the economies of the euro zone and the united kingdom we look pretty good
2353397 there is a perception that they are falling faster into a deeper recession and that we in the u s are muddling through
2353398 the market is celebrating a 5 drop in oil prices but were not out of the woods yet
2353399 oil prices are still 50 a barrel more than they should be
2353400 its a very complex machine this is a step towards getting ready
2353401 we have a lot of questions and not a lot of answers
2353402 i went to turn up and i just couldnt do what i normally did
2353403 weve talked about a two quarterback system and we knew this would be coming not quite in this form but we knew we wanted to develop ronnie so this is a blessing in a sense and also allows us to give locker a little bit of rest
2353404 one of the impediments to change is protective legislation and the status of kangaroos as a national icon
2353405 it is becoming ever clearer that eating less meat and choosing more environmentally friendly meat such as kangaroo can be a significant step to cutting carbon as well as improving health
2353406 they are able to amass a huge amount of money and using that money to go out and buy land to do their marijuana cultivation
2353407 this year were probably going to surpass 2007 easily just given the way were starting
2353408 the yakima valley is a huge player these are big operations that are difficult to track down
2353409 they use fictitious names they put property in daughters wives names to conceal identity and try to thwart law enforcement from going forward with civil forfeiture
2353410 theres no way of them knowing who the buyer is
2353411 it is a phenomenon that is taking place all over italy and it is growing all the time in the last few days 120 black cats have vanished in milan
2353412 in venice 63 have gone and in florence 20 disappeared in a week and a similar number have gone missing in rome we have strong suspicions that these cats are being used in satanic rituals
2353413 we want to halt this massacre educate people and restore dignity to black cats
2353414 it would be great if he would speak out in recognition of our initiative and say the prejudice against black cats is a lot of nonsense
2353415 we are aware of several cases where the corpses of black cats have been found at sites used by satanists they are sacrificed as part of rituals they believe in
2353416 this is a good day for the tigers the zoo and the people of iraq
2353417 last year it was a very bad situation in baghdad but now it is good
2353418 our heart goes out to the tigers they will be caged helpless and completely dependent on humans to survive

2353423 johannes m ller von k nigsberg called regiomontanus was arguably the most important astronomer of the fifteenth century it is often said and justly that regiomontanus set the agenda for the reform of astronomy to which copernicus tycho brahe and kepler all contributed
2353424 printed calendars and almanacs became extremely popular in the fifteenth century and provided ordinary people with the basic knowledge required to plan their daily routines
2353425 in this work drexel compares the sorrowful life to a school which man has to pass through drexel had been treating this matter before as a preacher to the bavarian electoral court the german translation by joachim meichel was published in 1630 under the title

2353428 jeez kevin calling you an asshole would be a huge understatement wouldnt it
2353429 on some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their hearts desire at last and the white house will be adorned by a downright moron
2353430 good politicians like good scientists draw conclusions from facts bad politicians like bad scientists draw facts from conclusions
2353431 the most important development of the entire campaign this week
2353432 we have not inherited the earth from our parents we have borrowed it from our children
2353433 on some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their hearts desire at last and the white house will be adorned by a downright moron
2353434 good politicians like good scientists draw conclusions from facts bad politicians like bad scientists draw facts from conclusions
2353435 we have not inherited the earth from our parents we have borrowed it from our children
2353436 you cannot see the future with tears in your eyes
2353437 im 87 years old and ive never had any opportunity to see this sort of thing
2353438 i wrote a letter to the city saying i support it
2353439 it makes the whole movie you can see the back yards
2353440 our cinematographer said he loves the roof lines i drove around for five weeks and there were only four blocks in the metro area like that
2353441 you can almost draw a circle around a radius and youre hitting the sweet spot for the right locations with housing and buildings built in the early 1950s and 1960s
2353442 one criteria were using is not a lot of mature tree cover thats been a hard thing
2353443 i think residents will feel like theyre part of the crew
2353444 people know the coens are from here and theyre trying to make an investment back in the community i think thats great
2353445 ill never see anything like this again in my life i think its wonderful
2353446 this is one of those very fun things that just fall in your lap
2353447 was wir bisher immer nur vermuten konnten wird jetzt durch zahlen untermauert
2353448 werbung in social networks l uft zurzeit noch nicht gut doch
2353449 f r uns war die teilnahme am wettbewerb eine art marktforschung
2353450 a range of emotions im very disappointed im numbed by it
2353451 look set to be compounded by a deteriorating economic outlook with consensus forecasts pointing to slowing growth in many countries
2353452 it has been a chastening experience and reporting a pre tax loss of 691 million is something i and my colleagues regret very much
2353453 this loss is a consequence of previously signalled write downs on credit market exposures amounting to 5 9 billion
2353454 in response to these new market conditions we moved decisively to strengthen our capital position materially
2353455 in so doing we are acutely aware that we drew heavily on our shareholders for financial support and we recognise that we must now deliver a level of performance that meets their expectations for the company and restores value to our shares
2353456 we are determined to do so and this is our focus
2353457 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document as outlined in mr suskinds book
2353458 now this is from the vice presidents office is how you remembered it not from the president
2353459 what i remember is george tenet saying we got this from basically from what george said was downtown
2353460 but he did not in my memory never said president vice president or nsc okay but now he may have hinted just by the way he said it it would have cause almost all that stuff came from one place only scooter libby and the shop around the vice president
2353461 i would naturally i would probably stand on my basically my reputation and say it came from the vice president
2353462 but there wasnt anything in the writing that you remember saying the vice president
2353463 you know if youve ever seen the vice presidents stationery its on the white house letterhead it may have said ovp office of the vice president i dont remember that so i dont want to mislead you
2353464 this posting is contrary to my practice across 25 years as a journalist but the issues in this matter are simply too important to stand as discredited in any way
2353465 i would say right it came to us george had a raised eyebrow and basically we passed it on it was to and passed this on into the organization
2353466 well as propellers programming manager and the one who runs the aforementioned scout team i can say these reports are being blown a little out of proportion we did let a few scouts go but it was 4 out of about 35 so that fraction we were reduced to is roughly 9 10ths
2353467 rather than reduce the pay rate of management propeller has simply downsized its more expendable content control team
2353468 we can take advantage of the infrastructure we already have
2353469 i cannot see any real purpose in holding further talks the philosophies of the two boards are so far apart that i really cannot see us coming together on it at all
2353470 the grampian joint fire and rescue board was committed to the joint headquarters project but not at any cost as board members we are duty bound to ensure best value for the communities of grampian
2353471 what we wanted was a building which is basically an office block not an operational building we wanted a building that would provide the best value to the public and building it on probably the premier site in aberdeen when it doesnt need to be here does not deliver best value to the public
2353472 we rely on each other and we have to work together
2353473 the difference of opinion is about the location it is disappointing for all involved that we havent been able to reach an agreement on the location
2353474 the fire board wish a peripheral site and the police board have said for some time quite clearly that we cant support a peripheral site for an hq
2353475 there are real strategic benefits to having an hq which is central
2353476 above all an hq that is central indicates very clearly that the emergency services are at the heart of the community
2353477 we have to learn from our history its a story that should be told because places like craigmillar are so maligned
2353478 i am delighted that agnes moffat is to be remembered in this way
2353479 i fill five buckets the weight is more than 22 cwt twenty journeys is oer sore for females
2353480 the coal miners could not read or write so no stories of them were written
2353481 historically place names in the area recognised the powerful landowning families such as the prestons and the wauchopes who dominated craigmillar from the middle ages to the late 19th century
2353482 but craigmillar has always been about the people who live and work there and the vibrant community they have created
2353483 in the spirit of regeneration we wanted to celebrate these people who made a real difference to the society around them agnes moffat is a wonderful example of this
2353484 as well as place naming we will also be working closely with the local community to look at other ways of keeping their memory alive such as innovative public art projects and street sculpture
2353485 the police who were already seeking someone for similar acts at la defense the high rise business park to the west of the capital arrested a man on thursday morning who appears to have confessed
2353486 has just said he intends to convert to judaism before marrying his fianc e who is jewish and the heiress to the founders of darty
2353487 could be interpreted as drawing a link between conversion to judaism and social success
2353488 condemned most vigorously these racist acts destined to taint the name and the family of the president of the republic
2353489 the ump expects the justice system to react with the greatest severity against acts which recall the most sombre hours of our history
2353490 the laws have been toughened up and all captains should be aware that they are supposed to inform us of the names of those on tenders taken ashore from yachts in this case the captain of the yacht which was flying a us flag did not inform us and as a result he was fined
2353491 i always thought it was a harmless hobby i certainly never thought a paperweight could kill me people need to be aware how dangerous these things can be
2353492 they look so appealing and you never think they could cause an accident but they can be dangerous
2353493 i dont want to scare anyone but it is worth saying that if you do have glass items like this you should be aware of where you position them
2353494 its possible that things like glass or crystal paperweights or magnifying mirrors can set something alight if they happen to catch the suns rays it would need to be intense heat from the sun focusing on another object for a long time
2353495 it is certainly unusual but ive experienced it a couple of times in the past
2353496 these two children with e coli o157 have social contact with each other and also both attended a childcare facility in the last week
2353497 fortunately both children are doing well are at home and under the care of their gp
2353498 many of these results are now available and i am pleased to say that all are negative for e coli o157 so far
2353499 there is an inevitability that jobs will go even with this plan we would like it to have been more but we now have a commitment and can get on with the plan there will never be a case in history where we are entirely happy with what has been offered
2353500 the scottish government is determined to help the fishing industry adapt to high fuel costs and although we cant control the price of fuel we will do what we can to help in other ways
2353501 the fishing industry has been particularly hard hit with the crippling increase in fuel prices fuel costs count for as much as half the earnings of boats and cannot be passed on
2353502 despite limited resources we are willing to do all we can to make these go as far as possible to help our fishermen and the industries and communities they support
2353503 i am well aware there are some vessels struggling out there but there are no easy fixes or off the shelf solutions to the crippling effect that rising fuel costs will have
2353504 services for older people are either being cut or charges have increased
2353505 pensioners ha advertisement ve paid into the pot all their lives and they deserve a fair deal when they retire its not enough for alex salmond to complain about westminster when it is his government that is making the cuts
2353506 scottish labour led by me will have a pensioners champion and we will ensure that the views and needs of scotlands pensioners run through our policies
2353507 he was in high spirits as were the rest of the passengers and he had taken a drink
2353508 the arrests of those individuals and their subsequent sentencing has shown that strathclyde police the crown office and procurator fiscal service and south lanarkshire council will not tolerate a minority bringing misery to the lives of others and that through partnership working that minority will be brought to justice
2353509 we all want south lanarkshire to be a place that residents can feel safe in and be proud of and where there is no place for criminal activity in that vision
2353510 strathclyde police work to gather as much information as possible to deal with offences and offenders but we also rely heavily on the people of south lanarkshire to help us by coming forward with information they may have
2353511 that was the case with operation robust and i believe it has sent out a clear message to anyone engaging in criminality that they can and will be caught
2353512 as with all cases involving class a drugs we as prosecutors were absolutely committed to gathering all available evidence in preparation for what would certainly have been a very lengthy trial process had the accused not accepted their guilt
2353513 we are in no doubt about the corrosive effect which the supply of illicit drugs can have on a community
2353514 these convictions and sentences send a clear message to all those who continue to supply drugs in our communities that these destructive crimes will simply not be tolerated and that those responsible cannot escape justice
2353515 the monarch is the one embodiment of the state which is outside the political partisan process
2353516 the people behind this campaign must either oppose the idea of anyone who is non partisan having a role in the affairs of state or they would rather be swearing allegiance to brussels
2353517 recognises that some honourable members would prefer to swear an oath of allegiance to their constituents and the nation rather than the monarch
2353518 bring forward legislative proposals to introduce an optional alternative parliamentary oath
2353519 swear allegiance to their constituents and the nation and to pledge to uphold the law
2353520 his eternal optimism and complete lack of ego will be a great loss to the climbing community
2353521 when he was abseiling down one of the guys made a big technical mistake and he fell
2353522 i dont know whats worse or harder to believe that a little boy could be f up enough to harbor the sort of sadness and rage that the entity presents us with every day or that thousands of souls could be fused by a firebomb into a restless collection of spirits that hungers for a justice it can only define in terms of punishment
2353523 just put out your hand the angel kept telling me
2353524 but the final ameliorative conversation between father and son doesnt quite happen the way the angel had expected
2353525 it has no future but itself its infinite contain its past enlightened to perceive new periods of pain
2353526 it seems to me that dsm having given free expert advice by telephone then attended the home of the defender and i consider that if a member of the public asked a tradesman to attend they could expect to pay a call out charge
2353527 what i would say to people is that they must make absolutely sure preferably in writing about what payments will be demanded of them before allowing any tradesman through their door
2353528 if you do not specifically ask about a call out charge this court case today proves that you will be liable to pay one
2353529 i would also say that you should be very careful about what tradesmen say in adverts
2353530 this is a superb day for us and its a victory for small businesses and the working man
2353531 only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california
2353532 now the secretary of state is free to print all the information to notify the voters and in fact the voters will speak in november
2353533 and when they speak i believe theyll pass these 14 words these 14 words will overrule the 4 to 3 decision of the california supreme court and

2353551 we have already undertaken a series of initiatives including raising more than 7bn in additional capital in the second quarter to help us manage through the most difficult us housing market in more than 70 years
2353552 todays solution provides further relief beginning in september to investors who have been understandably frustrated by the industry wide failure of the ars market
2353553 if you are an international organisation dependent on international visitors and guests eliminating your carbon footprint is going to be impossible its about tidying up the edges and not being profligate rather than eliminating it its about doing our best
2353554 the things that will have effect are the price of oil and whether people can come at all
2353555 where a flight is essential people should offset it and be very careful to buy offsets that are genuinely beneficial
2353556 i cut the labels out of my clothes for two reasons one because they itch and the second reason is that there is always someone who tries to look in your clothes to see what you wear
2353557 this always annoys me terribly i find it very uncomfortable when your jacket opens to reveal a little label and you dont even realise it and then it might also come across that you are hanging your jacket over a chair to show that its a gucci jacket like see i have the money to buy a gucci coat so i hate labels
2353558 its not obvious that our products are expensive and that is a good thing i hate anything that looks like it cost a lot of money its distasteful what you pay for are the materials and a unique make
2353559 when i came here i took the logos off everything because there were logos on everything e v e r y t h i n g there were logos on every buckle every clothing system all the linings everywhere
2353560 if this was going to be a company that defines itself by the make you should be able to recognise the product by the way it is made
2353561 everything needs to be as beautiful on the inside as it is on the outside
2353562 cruise is a very interesting collection because it is turning into a season in its own right
2353563 its the longest of any season on the floor because it doesnt need ever to go on sale until early july
2353564 if you let the little things go there are so many little things that at the end of the day it becomes a big thing so you have to be a perfectionist in every little detail if you own a garment or a bag and there is one thing that is not right its not right

2353579 i am very disappointed and numbed by it it is a very unsatisfactory situation made all the more so by the shadow it casts over the very good performance of some of our businesses
2353580 it is my determination to get us out of all this i wont do this job for ever but right now im extremely galvanised by the task in hand
2353581 the balance sheet was too large for the individual bank that we are and too large for current markets
2353582 if you go cold turkey on lending to the market your capital ratios rise but people have long memories we are open for business

2353588 weve got a problem but we dont know how big it is
2353589 the jurys kind of still out on the impact but it cant be a good impact
2353590 sort of the delta airplane hub of the west in terms of migration
2353591 this award represents a significant milestone in my career here at ucsb
2353592 it will enable me to pursue additional research and perform advanced analyses and observations that i would not otherwise be able to do in addition i plan to complete a second textbook this one on the applications of optics for oceanography
2353593 our first thoughts were that it was outrageous she was able to walk out of that court get back in her car and drive she had killed somebody that didnt seem right to me
2353594 we understood that the death couldnt be taken into consideration in court but there was no dignity given to my son it was outrageous that the sheriff could give such a light penalty
2353595 im worried the courts will use this as a soft option the prosecution might downgrade death by dangerous to death by careless as it will be easier to prove
2353596 each case will be carefully considered on its own facts and circumstances and according to what is in the public interest
2353597 the fact someone died due to careless driving could not be considered in charge or sentence thankfully that will no longer happen weve been campaigning for this for 23 years
2353598 would have to be a hard r and the r stands for reefer
2353599 a program sponsored by that citys public library its my first trip as a published author it might also be my last cue the
2353600 the a c hasnt worked since we got back on the plane in indianapolis
2353601 but i assumed things would start cooling off once we got higher the air
2353602 im just glad i remembered to use deodorant this morning
2353603 youve probably noticed that were having a problem with our air conditioning thats because were experiencing a cabin pressure issue theres no danger the planes flying normally but we cant climb to our scheduled cruising altitude of 36 000 feet because we cant pressurize the cabin were troubleshooting the problem with our mechanics on the ground and well let you know more as the situation develops
2353604 but if the stewardess starts asking who didnt have the fish then you know were screwed
2353605 now all we need is a nun playing a guitar
2353606 people will start making a bigger deal out of this than it is
2353607 some guyll say there was a hole in the plane that we mightve crashed
2353608 the technicians are close to fixing the problem if you get off youll just be getting back on again
2353609 we had to turn around because we didnt have enough fuel to fly to kansas city at 9000 feet
2353610 you mean they dont fill the tanks to the brim every time we go up
2353611 but thats cutting it kind of close dont you think having to fly at 36 000 and not 9000 feet in an emergency
2353612 ever since they stopped giving away free peanuts flying sucks
2353613 failure to comply with flight attendants instructions is a federal offense
2353614 the fish were boiled in the lake due to the release of hot water from the mid urals power plant
2353615 we can confirm that a member of the colleges teaching staff returned earlier than expected to aberdeen from the world challenge expedition to tanzania
2353616 a full investigation is being carried out in line with the colleges procedures the individual has been suspended on full pay pending the outcome of this investigation
2353617 at one point the kids all went drinking which had nothing to do with me they went out at lunchtime and came back after they had had a few beers and apparently the school was contacted but i wasnt the direct leader of the group
2353618 i did nothing wrong i am very experienced at these things and this was my fourth trip with the school this year but i had never been on a trip with world challenge before
2353619 we did have an incident and it resulted in the teacher coming back from the expedition but it is for the school to give details
2353620 expeditions going to developing countries are in four different phases
2353621 we have an acclimatisation phase when the team first arrives then we have a trekking phase
2353622 then they do a project involving cultural work in the community
2353623 and then they have a few days of what we call rest and relaxation when they do different activities before coming back
2353624 were doing well but there are others many in fact who are getting really nervous and are on the verge of qualifying for welfare
2353625 the colour and fireworks were simply remarkable it is a country with a hell of a heritage and we could only expect something this phenomenal
2353626 these opening ceremonies are all about one upmanship sydney was the last games to receive real praise for its show but the progress is clear

2353638 the genius of this is that its completely reusable they have attacks that let them load chosen content to a chosen location with chosen permissions
2353639 this stuff just takes a knife to a large part of the security mesh microsoft built into vista
2353640 if you think about the fact that net loads dlls into the browser itself and then microsoft assumes theyre safe because theyre net objects you see that microsoft didnt think about the idea that these could be used as stepping stones for other attacks
2353641 this is not insanely technical these two guys are capable of the really low level technical attacks but this is simple and reusable
2353642 since these techniques do not rely on any one specific vulnerability zovi believes that we may suddenly see many similar techniques applied to other platforms or environments
2353643 load chosen content to a chosen location with chosen permissions
2353644 if you think about the fact that net loads dlls into the browser itself and then microsoft assumes theyre safe because theyre net objects you see that microsoft didnt think about the idea that these could be used as stepping stones for other attacks this is a real tour de force
2353645 im not a fan of much of obamas politics i think his economic policies if enacted would cause the economy to fall i think his global policies are too liberal utopian in outlook and i wonder if once in office will reality cause him to react along his beliefs or react with a realism view but before all of that he has to win the presidential race i think that a black person can win the presidency but i dont think a black person as liberal left of center whatever as he is can do it even against someone like mccain he obama has to make most white people comfortable and to do that he has to de black or at least be real beige thats the reason for the comment on tailoring affirmative action to class and saying hes not supportive of reparations im not saying anything ground breaking here i think hes close to having people comfortable but not close enough plus it is becoming evident to me that obama is like badly fried chicken looks good on the outside but is a little raw on the inside and lacks full seasoning his camp handled the primary well but they are rattled right now and its only going to get worse they need to stop apologizing for things other people say hit mccain hard and down play the race angle as well as they can do so
2353646 look at me ive have a real live sarcophagus in my room

2353668 we found a chemical reporter that detects a relatively rare event one that is related to the action of the toxin
2353669 our reporter probe shows that the reaction is taking place
2353670 when theres no toxin there will be no light emission
2353671 now that we have an assay that senses the toxins activity we can try to discover inhibitors of the toxin or antidotes
2353672 fired two reporters who were paid 20 000 for collaborating with the national enquirer on an elizabeth smart story because they misled their employer about the level of their involvement with the tabloid

2353695 there is a lot of discrimination in bolivia against people living with hiv aids especially among the medical personnel because they are not prepared or they dont have the knowledge so when they find out your diagnosis they simply refuse to help you
2353696 the immense joy i felt motivated me to give advice on the prevention of vertical transmission and child nutrition for pregnant women based on my own experience
2353697 you must go on because there is no turning back one has to learn to accept it and live with hiv aids its not easy but it can be done and it must be done for our children
2353698 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with sen obama than sen mccain
2353699 we may have started on two separate paths but we are on one journey now
2353700 which is why sen obama needs all of us he needs us working for him
2353701 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all
2353702 were going to have a very clear message about how the campaign will cooperate and how the convention will be conducted when its appropriate to make that announcement
2353703 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2353704 you could argue that no ones ever ready to be president i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year you could argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can ever be fully ready for the pressures of the office and that everyone learns something and something different you could argue that
2353705 you are so beautiful to me the lighting of the unity candle the organ was used for the rest of the ceremony the bridal procession and the hymns and the signing of the register and then of course the recessional it was powerful and majestic very befitting of the surroundings the sounds reverberating from the massive pipes it was beautiful
2353706 strong deliverer strong deliverer be thou still my strength and shield be thou my strength and shield
2353707 they have attacks that let them load chosen content to a chosen location with chosen permissions thats completely game over
2353708 what this means is that almost any vulnerability in the browser is trivially exploitable
2353709 a lot of exploit defenses are rendered useless by browsers aslr and hardware dep are completely useless against these attacks
2353710 this stuff just takes a knife to a large part of the security mesh microsoft built into vista
2353711 if you think about the fact that net loads dlls into the browser itself and then microsoft assumes theyre safe because theyre net objects you see that microsoft didnt think about the idea that these could be used as stepping stones for other attacks this is a real tour de force
2353712 they have attacks that let them load chosen content to a chosen location with chosen permissions thats completely game over

2353715 lies just one spot below the worlds top 200 forbes list of the worlds billionaires this is higher than such household names as donald trump sir richard branson and steven spielberg
2353716 i am shocked at the news of repayments being frozen especially given that senior managers of hanover have recently been advising me that the company was coping well with the difficult trading conditions
2353717 during his time at merrill lynch his base salary would have been more than us250 000 nz336 138 topped up by a bonus of cash shares and options on shares
2353718 ideally they would like it that the only thing the new entrants can pick up is people who already dont have cellphones which is a lot tougher sell
2353719 its going to be tougher for the new entrants especially if they see most of the subscribers when they move into the market already locked into three year contracts
2353720 i suspect that what some of the carriers might be trying to do is to get folks to sign up for extended contracts over the next year
2353721 theres going to be lots of choice out there lots of opportunities to get really good deals and find all sorts of devices and i would imagine there are all sorts of services that i havent even begun to think of i think back to school next year there are going to be come exciting offers
2353722 since those phones are normally quite expensive they will heavily subsidize them in order to get people to come in and get longer term contracts
2353723 i dont think that practice has any thing to do with the new entrants
2353724 i would do it if i were them i would try to make sure that my customer base is more secure and offer something in advance of a new entrant such as a globalive being out there its going to take time to build our network so they might as well get a jump on us
2353725 then again i dont blame you for not picking the flames to advance further in the playoffs after choosing them to do quite well for the last two years hopefully youre poor faith will leave us all pleasantly surprised
2353726 i do hope im wrong but this sharks team just looks good
2353727 i have meditated and considered my decision to put aside the shugden at length in my soul and spirit before coming to the right decision
2353728 we are in the right hes the one who is being incoherent on one hand hes always preaching freedom of religion and compassion but on the other hes forbidding us to worship the god we choose
2353729 were not violating buddhas teachings and were excluded from everywhere just because of our religion
2353730 arent you ashamed of betraying the dalai lama youre a monk he is our only pillar the only person we can count on
2353731 i was the only shugden in my village every day i grew more afraid of attacks i had to block my door with stones for people not to break into my house
2353732 their cults all over the world are financed by the chinese
2353733 people are afraid of shugden violence they are like terrorists they will stop at nothing everyone knows this
2353734 i approve the chinese presence in tibet what we are living with the dalai lama today shows how authoritarian his theocratic regime must have been in the past it was much more violent than what tibetans are living today under chinese rule
2353735 its like saying once you get into willy wonkas chocolate factory and youre in the garden where everythings edible you have it all
2353736 during winter 2006 07 i saw what i presume was the same seal attacking and killing eiders on numerous occasions and i also found several carcases along the shoreline interestingly as far as i can ascertain all the birds attacked have been drakes
2353737 when attacks are observed in one area they are not seen in the others lending support to the idea that just one seal may be involved
2353738 it seems possible that the attacks are related to declining fish supplies during the winter compared with plentiful supplies of mackerel during the summer
2353739 typically the seal would approach its victim underwater and take the bird from underneath as it sat on the water
2353740 on several occasions the seal appeared to play with the duck much as a cat plays with a mouse sometimes for up to 15 minutes before skinning it by vigorous shaking and eventually consuming the bird
2353741 largely under water but surfacing occasionally apparently to check on the shearwaters proximity
2353742 when about 20m from them he dived steeply and after a pause exploded among the feeding shearwaters scattering them in all directions
2353743 one individual was caught and i clearly saw its fluttering wings in the seals mouth
2353744 after swallowing the shearwater the seal repeated the manoeuvre and succeeded in catching three more with ease in less than two hours
2353745 where they begin by burning books they will end by burning people
2353746 terrifying sea monster turns out to be even more terrifying amphibious monster
2353747 and this is the uae team for the first time it has two females present although theyre both daughters of the president which im sure is just a coincidence
2353748 isto um caso de grande gravidade quando o c digo do processo penal foi feito deviam ter previsto os casos de grande complexidade e n o est o previstos ou melhor est o previstos em moldes que n o resolvem o problema
2353749 qual a consequ ncia da publicidade para os inqu ritos
2353750 na pequena criminalidade n o h problema ofensas corporais n o exigem segredos de justi a um acidente de via o um cheque sem cobertura tamb m n o mas na criminalidade organizada e violenta n o poss vel cumprir esses prazos que s o demasiado curtos
2353751 portanto na sua opini o a publicidade vai comprometer as investiga es
2353752 acho que sim as per cias t m que ser feitas s o extraordinariamente complexas e morosas facilmente estes prazos se esgotam
2353753 there are a lot of guys that whine and say if i cant make it to calgary then im quitting yet heres a guy who once he hit 65 couldnt make it regardless of how well he did he still wanted to go on tour
2353754 he said im feeling so damn good im going to do one more thats kind of how he was hes been planning on quitting for the last five years but he just kept coming back apparently he was ready to come back for 2009
2353755 my favourite memory of herman is every time we did an introduction herman as a cowboy would popped his hat off waved and was always smiling to the fans he was a fan pleaser
2353756 the lion shall lie with the lamb and the lamb wont get much sleep
2353757 text to speech technology is still rather primitive but it does work
2353758 where is the value in having a computer with accessibility options if you cannot configure them independently
2353759 its just an example of the typical police attitude of racial and age profiling
2353760 matthew speculates he thinks maybe they enjoy being patient and are excited where things left off
2353761 it will allow the diagnosis of underlying inflammation to distinguish diseases of iron metabolism that stem from hepcidin versus those with other causes
2353762 it can help us divine the effects of inflammation on body iron stores
2353763 she was sort of disturbing other spectators around her which is against the house rules
2353764 i actually prefer hard courts more than clay i hope i can keep up this level now that im moving into the top 20
2353765 i made a couple of mistakes and he started to feel much more comfortable on the court my momentum was gone
2353766 happiness off court translates to a clear mind on court and thats the case for me
2353767 theres a leakage from traditional chinese religions which dont seem to have the same appeal to younger people
2353768 last year we had 4 000 paid entries but kids under 12 get in free and they were just everywhere
2353769 people arent scared to go in the water because of blue marlin theyre scared to go in the water because of sharks the ideology and fear behind it has a lot to do with it that and people just want to see a 12 foot fish
2353770 a crowd draws crowd i think that works pretty well for us
2353771 discovery channel has shark week its huge publicity i dont know how to explain the fascination whether people want to see whats really out there or what it is
2353772 one is very much an out of town crowd the shark crowd is going to people from out of town but theyre coming to the event not for the event as well as a tremendous amount of locals
2353773 they always catch big fish and people like to see big fish
2353774 the conservation effort in the others billfish tournaments going more to catch and release where the sharks they bring them to the dock and people know theyre gong to get to see something
2353775 collecting samples from some of these animals is very vital
2353776 the other thing i like about this tournament is the tag and release category more animals are getting tagged and hopefully will be recaught and we can learn more about their movement and growth
2353777 were not a blood bath we try to encourage the tag and release as much as possible
2353778 the scientists are there doing research its something good for people to come see these sharks one on one
2353779 we seem to work well together and itd be hard to do it without him
2353780 the kids can get down there and touch those things and they just squeal and smile
2353781 beijing olympics opening was successful the fireworks show was dazzling
2353782 the most extravagant olympic opening ceremony costing an astronomical sum to prepare
2353783 for the first time in 5 000 years the olympics has turned beijing into the centre of the universe
2353784 conduct relating to the lawful termination of the pregnancy of the mother of the child to which the mother has consented
2353785 you are a host to the present and a gateway to the future
2353786 at some stage we must expect that iran will acquire the capacity to enrich uranium on the scale required for a weapons programme
2353787 in practice the iranians have pursued their programme at their own pace the limiting factor being technical difficulties rather than resolutions by the u n
2353788 part of hpbs ongoing process to constantly upgrade and improve programmes targetted at youth
2353789 the high risk group are the normal students i can identify that
2353790 for instance in a special assistance plan sap school you can be very academic very technical but for normal students you should use simpler terms and language
2353791 it is a form of escapism for them when they turn to unprotected sex
2353792 it is a concern that younger children below 12 are involved in sex and parents are ignorant of the reality
2353793 it is a form of escapism for them when they
2353794 i love feeling womens breasts i am guilty of that
2353795 she had a set of hooters that i just couldnt keep my hands off it was purely a sexual thing and there was no violence involved
2353796 it was worse than seeing my friends killed in iraq
2353797 she likes to touch hooters just likes all christians do
2353798 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter it is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen
2353799 the entries four year span covers the descent of europe into the second world war and orwells travels in morocco following the injuries he sustained fighting in the spanish civil war
2353800 obama wins demo nomination a black flag for white america
2353801 will be a clear signal for millions of our people
2353802 obama is a visual aid for white americans who just dont get it yet that we have lost control of our country and unless we get it back we are heading for complete annihilation as a people
2353803 instead of this so called civil rights bill for example that says you have to give preferences to minorities i think the american people are going once they see the obamanation theyre going to demand a tweaking of that and say you have to put the majority into office
2353804 we deplore the russian military action in georgia which is a violation of georgian sovereignty and territorial integrity
2353805 it protects our affiliates our advertisers and shows it to the largest number of viewers possible
2353806 what a joke i got up this morning to watch the ceremony assuming that it would be on
2353807 they thought people could pretend to ignore such an important event was happening on the other side of the globe its impossible
2353808 i cant understand how in 2008 in the area of instant access with multiple media outlets nbc behaves as if we are in 1950 and has the guts to make audiences wait for a live coverage that many other countries in the world can see as they are taking place
2353809 richest country in the world and we cant watch the olympic opening ceremony live its being shown live all over the world nbc is pathetic
2353810 nbc is an acronym for not airing before making big cash
2353811 obviously i wont repeat myself but it is an honorable goal to ban the proliferation of nuclear weapons a devastating weapon
2353812 well make the decision to press the button on the online packages only when readers are able to pick up the inquirer on their doorstep or on the newsstand
2353813 asked at a st louis town hall last week how people could contribute to the effort to conserve fuel obama said that steps such as inflating tires to the correct levels could make a difference republicans have seized on the comment to suggest that the advice on tires was the sum total of the energy plan put forth by obama
2353814 this pushed georgia into a philosophy of self reliance the idea that georgia will be able to regain breakaway entities only by its own means
2353815 my address wasnt published and i only lived there a short while before carl and i got married and moved out of state
2353816 no one knew my address or my phone number you had to stalk me to figure this stuff out
2353817 i had no idea he lived anywhere in the vicinity i wonder if its possible that ivins moved to that location to be close to nancy
2353818 i said this happened and im sure youre the one who did it and he denied it
2353819 and i said well im still sure you did what can you do at that point
2353820 he seemed to know a lot about myself my children things i never remembered telling him which always disturbed me
2353821 i kept him at arms length as best i could
2353822 definitely as singapore opens up and more foreigners start to come in some are bound to have bad habits because of the different cultures they are used to
2353823 its difficult out there the wind blew all day and it was a little difficult later on
2353824 id like to play good this week to put myself in a good position
2353825 it was a little breezy but there were some softer conditions out there
2353826 i think its the round of the year for sure its the kind of round i have been looking for to get myself back on the leaderboard and feeling the good vibes
2353827 it was a struggle for me i did my best to be ready for the week but clearly im not
2353828 what can i say the harder i tried the worse it got
2353829 i havent got the focus this week im just not with it obviously im still just having a hangover after winning the open
2353830 2008 beijing olympics global village athletes home is a big city all by itself
2353831 staged the most expensive most spectacular ceremony in the history of the modern games
2353832 a great start to what promises to be an amazing spectacle
2353833 it was a difficult possibly a prohibitively expensive act for london the next olympic host to follow in four years
2353834 ive been having with locals lately show that among swing voters ma is facing uphill climbing
2353835 we are getting an unbelievable response and it is first come first served
2353836 this incredible response and excitement shows that there is a huge appetite for change in colorado
2353837 the lefties who think fox news is horribly biased also consider michael moore films
2353838 the gop needs to think it over who would they rather have speak for them john mccain or ann coulter
2353839 hes targeted by people like coulter because he is above the
2353840 the only way of framing things is what theyve learned
2353841 the younger the child the more suggestible the child is
2353842 jon phillips knows that someone has their eyeballs on how he treats these children right
2353843 did you ever see any work being done on the closet doors in that apartment
2353844 excited to show off that he had learned his days of the week
2353845 they ran up to him they hugged him they sat on his lap
2353846 i asked him why his mom and dad were in jail
2353847 they didnt take care of me and made me eat fish
2353848 it would appear that his focus became on placement issues
2353849 im not sure we will ever know all of the trauma he has been through in his life
2353850 mommy and daddy took the box out to the dumpster
2353851 i am in the closet with chandler we are in the closet with the doors closed because we are in trouble
2353852 his brother often asked for food and his brother was hungry
2353853 sometimes his parents would let him get out of the closet and sometimes they wouldnt
2353854 when chandler stole food he had to go to the closet
2353855 that is what my goal is in my relationship with the boy
2353856 the ranking is natural given gujarats growth surats employment generation is equal to many fast growing cities of the world
2353857 the study has shown that gujarat is more prosperous than 90 per cent of the country
2353858 you have my permission to use any of my posts in part or whole in your thread
2353859 consider how liberal government authorities like mayor gavin newsom have corrupted the men in blue by stipulating that police not prosecute public nudity and indecency at homosexual festivals
2353860 what honor can there be in protecting the public practice of heinous perversions and nudity in the citys streets the shame of pandering politicians is transferred to the cops who were intended to be guardians of the law and public order
2353861 i think murder is wrong but dont let that stop you
2353862 en 2006 comet un serio error y me conduje de una forma desleal a mi familia y a mis creencias
2353863 estuve y estoy avergonzado de mi conducta y de mis decisiones esperaba que esto nunca se hiciera p blico
2353864 mentido repetidamente durante su campa a presidencial sobre un romance extra matrimonial con una cineasta novel

2353884 i welcome rocco and i am confident that he will add quality and strength to our team
2353885 while they are deploying the anti missile systems in poland and the czech republic our long range strategic aircraft already will be landing in cuba
2353886 we continue to continue to work with the russians on this issue
2353887 we have consistently made it clear to them that our proposed deployment of a limited missile defense system in europe poses no threat to them or to their nuclear deterrent
2353888 it is with great distress that the ifj reports that roxas murder and the attack on cuesta have seen the philippines return to the top of the most dangerous countries in the asia pacific region for journalists so far in 2008
2353889 the ifj welcomes reports that the capiz provincial police have established a taskforce to investigate roxas shooting and that two persons have been detained
2353890 only through public condemnation and the active pursuit of justice will authorities send a clear message that such heinous attacks will not be tolerated
2353891 teams are working to restore power supply at shapur and idl sub stations
2353892 we have found a number of anomalies in their statements and arrested them on charges of violating the foreigners act we have to interrogate them further to know about their links and motive behind coming to india
2353893 we are also not ruling out the possibility of their involvement with any militant group
2353894 along with simi activists a number of huji militants have also entered india through this border we have drawn the attention of the home department to this
2353895 our goal is to see a crowd of 75 000 people at obamas nomination speech holding their hands above their heads fingers laced together in support of a new direction for this country a renewed hope and acceptance of responsibility for our future
2353896 we thought lets try and start a movement where even while walking down the street people would hold up the o and you would know that they were for obama
2353897 you interlace your hands in a circle the interlacing being a symbol of different types of people coming together and the circle a symbol of unity
2353898 we want to see it everywhere but more importantly we want this sign to take the world by storm
2353899 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want

2354052 i wanted to do something to be more energy efficient
2354053 i want to apologize for the interview that i did the other day where you asked me what was going on and i couldnt give you the answers now you can see there is an answer to what the questions were last week weve got brett favre as a new member of the jets we went through this process for the same reason weve been running the team all along with mike tannenbaum and eric mangini to try to improve this team each and every year i just want to say it was difficult with chad pennington because chad came at the same time i did and we owe chad a lot of gratitude for the dedication for his dogged team oriented persistence even in light of all the adversity that we had in some years he was always concentrated and always a good teammate so thanks to chad today were here to talk about what were going to be doing going forward so id like to toss it over to mike and he can describe what has happened the last 24 hours
2354054 thanks woody i dont have much more to add since the last time we spoke i dont know if weve gotten a chance to sleep since that time it is a bittersweet moment we have released chad i have spoken to him eric has spoken to him and mr johnson has spoken to him and again on the record i have all the respect in the world for chad and what hes done on the field as well as off the field hes a good player and a great person hes done a lot of great things for our organization and i wish him nothing but the best fundamentally the decision was made between eric myself and mr johnson from a standpoint that if this opportunity presented itself we felt we were getting good play at the quarterback position we felt this was a good opportunity to improve that and thats why we went ahead and made the decision we did a luminous amount of research on brett as a player but also as a person and making sure we thought he could fit in the locker room we were extremely comfortable not just with what he did on the field but as importantly what he did off the field and what he stands for we are happy we are excited were really glad hes a member of this team i can say on brett favres behalf that i think were all looking forward to getting past this stuff and going out there and playing some football
2354055 thanks mike and mr johnson the last 24 hours have been crazy really the last three weeks and this whole offseason has been bizarre or whatever you want to call it but it is what it is i am a member of the jets i am excited about it im excited about the opportunity and no one works as hard as this man right here mike tannenbaum i was told by numerous people to at least talk to mike over the last month and as i told him today the only reason that i wouldnt talk to him up until 24 hours ago was because i knew how id be convinced once i talked to him did i ever think this scenario would present itself no am i excited about the opportunity yes ive had a great career in green bay that goes without saying the things that have happened there this offseason in my opinion are over and done with i wish them well i will use their moving forward i hope that i play at the level that ive always played at theres no guarantees theres never been any guarantees for me the game of football is just that and anything can happen but ill bring the leadership and durability im a little bit out of shape compared to all the other guys but im so excited about this opportunity and ill tell you my family and everyone involved has just been treated unbelievably by this organization ive never looked forward to doing a conditioning test as much as i have at this point joking im so tired of doing interviews and talking about this or talking about that tomorrow hopefully the mad rush is over and we can get that conditioning test at noon tomorrow im looking forward to that joking and we go on the most important thing in this whole process is the guys in that locker room i know some of these guys by name bubba franks i played with and know personally but i really dont know these guys and they dont know me i think when they get to know me theyll like me and theyll like the way i play and theyll figure out that ill do whatever it takes to win and its about the team i hope after today and tomorrow that the distractions are at a minimum its ok to have attention as long as its based on this team and im just one man one of 53 so well see what happens and im excited about the opportunity
2354056 i cant answer that for them all i can say is ive always wanted to be a packer i think i always will be a packer sixteen years is hard to forget for everyone and id like to think that those 16 years people will say its the best 16 years ive ever watched it was a lot of fun for me i think it was made clear this offseason that they were moving forward some things happened in between that and thats okay and its time for me to move on i had forgotten that i had been traded 17 or 18 years ago and what that process was like its a little bit different scenario now but im really excited its refreshing not that i needed that i think to the fans i would say continue to be brett favre fans there may be some who say no and for those people maybe they were not die hard brett favre fans to begin with packer fans are packer fans theres a 40 000 or more waiting list for a reason and that will continue its a great tradition im thankful that i was a part of it im not a traitor i never will be its a business and thats the way it works i gave everything i possibly could give while i was there and i dont think people will question that and i hope that the jet fans see the same thing and so i hope i continue to have fans all over thats what we play for
2354057 i hadnt really thought about it im sure it will at some point but you know what they talk about statues they talk about having streets named after you im not just talking about me you hear that throughout sports thats not what its about with me its like records i gained at southern mississippi i look back and my experience there is much more important than the records and when and if that ever happens great i dont need a jersey retired a statue or a street named after me or anything like that for people to remember me for me to feel like ive done something i think the way ive played the way ive handled myself is the most important thing and i think it will be postponed for a while
2354058 ill tell you exactly why the decision or decisions that were made this whole offseason right or wrong i knew i was going to be faced with another tough one whereas if youre dealing with one team the decision is easy james bus cook would say at least talk to him several other people in this room said the same thing talk to him i told bus that if i talk to him that were going to be scratching our heads saying now what do we do i knew i would be convinced jon gruden i tip my hat to him too it was a long time ago when we were working together but he sold me as well theres nothing more to it than that i knew it would make it a real tough decision mike tannenbaum is a worker i woke up this morning and the trigger was pulled
2354059 i was never not interested in the jets i think my interest at first im sure as we all know was to stay within our division maybe that was a little bit of a vindictive nature or competitive nature or whatever i think in the end that was probably the wrong motive and i realized that was not going to happen thats only one or two games a year playing against your old team so you still have a lot more to play it had nothing to do with other teams i look at the talent level and believe me i heard it from mike tannenbaum i was sent everything about the jets you can imagine it was sent to my house and he told me everything i needed to know he was convincing i knew this team had a lot of talent i knew they struggled last year and he went out and worked his tail off i know hes worn out hes relieved now but i know at the end of the season hes going to be more relieved there came a point when i realized my initial thoughts were not going to come true that i had to look elsewhere i havent played in new york im a south mississippi boy mike came to my place today and he saw its a little bit different its a little laid back i know how tough it can be and i know how great it can be in new york city am i ready to face it handle it and deal with it i think so i think its a great opportunity
2354060 you have to dive into it the only way youre going to know these guys know how they play know the coaches is to be in meetings is to go to practice now id be kidding myself if i thought after the second day i wouldnt be walking on eggshells my feet will be hurting shoulder will be hurting all the fun things about camp that is the way you build chemistry to me the most important aspect of winning is chemistry you can have the best players possible but it doesnt guarantee you wins chemistry how you play together and i think the giants are a good example of that they started off shaky last year with the same guys the chemistry got better and they got better were up against the clock i want these guys to know me know what im about how i play what type of leadership i have im not going to call team meetings im not going to rah rah im going to do what i have to do pat guys on my back hug them pick them up off the ground and hope they do the same for me and hope thats enough to win

2354106 kasatochi went from a quiet volcano to an explosive eruption within 24 hours and with very little warning
2354107 we are thankful our colleagues were able to get out before the eruption began they were rescued just in time by a local fishing boat
2354108 fortunately the existing seismic networks on nearby volcanoes picked up the activity at kasatochi volcano
2354109 they were installed with funding from the federal aviation administration to reduce the hazard to aviation from volcanic ash these networks were crucial in recognizing that this volcano had entered the first stage of a major eruption
2354110 our hope is to have monitoring equipment on all volcanoes that pose the greatest threats to public safety
2354111 satellite imagery is useful to see the big picture of what is happening and what is going into the atmosphere but direct instrumentation such as placing seismic monitors around a volcano will help give an early warning and give people more time to plan for hazardous events

2354219 using a four bit microcontroller i would write a simple program that reads the darkness knob and quantizes its position to one of 16 shades of darkness from snow white to coal black the program would use that darkness level as the index to a 16 element table of initial timer values then it would turn on the heating elements and start the timer with the initial value selected from the table at the end of the time delay it would turn off the heat and pop up the toast come back next week and ill show you a working prototype
2354220 toasters dont just turn bread into toast they are also used to warm frozen waffles what you see before you is really a breakfast food cooker as the subjects of your kingdom become more sophisticated they will demand more capabilities they will need a breakfast food cooker that can also cook sausage fry bacon and make scrambled eggs a toaster that only makes toast will soon be obsolete if we dont look to the future we will have to completely redesign the toaster in just a few years
2354221 with this in mind we can formulate a more intelligent solution to the problem first create a class of breakfast foods specialize this class into subclasses grains pork and poultry the specialization process should be repeated with grains divided into toast muffins pancakes and waffles pork divided into sausage links and bacon and poultry divided into scrambled eggs hard boiled eggs poached eggs fried eggs and various omelet classes
2354222 the ham and cheese omelet class is worth special attention because it must inherit characteristics from the pork dairy and poultry classes thus we see that the problem cannot be properly solved without multiple inheritance at run time the program must create the proper object and send a message to the object that says cook yourself the semantics of this message depend of course on the kind of object so they have a different meaning to a piece of toast than to scrambled eggs
2354223 reviewing the process so far we see that the analysis phase has revealed that the primary requirement is to cook any kind of breakfast food in the design phase we have discovered some derived requirements specifically we need an object oriented language with multiple inheritance of course users dont want the eggs to get cold while the bacon is frying so concurrent processing is required too
2354224 we must not forget the user interface the lever that lowers the food lacks versatility and the darkness knob is confusing users wont buy the product unless it has a user friendly graphical interface when the breakfast cooker is plugged in users should see a cowboy boot on the screen users click on it and the message booting unix v 8 3 appears on the screen unix 8 3 should be out by the time the product gets to the market users can pull down a menu and click on the foods they want to cook
2354225 having made the wise decision of specifying the software first in the design phase all that remains is to pick an adequate hardware platform for the implementation phase an intel 80386 with 8mb of memory a 30mb hard disk and a vga monitor should be sufficient if you select a multitasking object oriented language that supports multiple inheritance and has a built in gui writing the program will be a snap imagine the difficulty we would have had if we had foolishly allowed a hardware first design strategy to lock us into a four bit microcontroller
2354226 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document as outlined in mr suskinds book
2354227 now this is from the vice presidents office is how you remembered it not from the president
2354228 what i remember is george tenet saying we got this from basically from what george said was downtown
2354229 but he did not in my memory never said president vice president or nsc okay but now he may have hinted just by the way he said it it would have cause almost all that stuff came from one place only scooter libby and the shop around the vice president
2354230 i would naturally i would probably stand on my basically my reputation and say it came from the vice president
2354231 but there wasnt anything in the writing that you remember saying the vice president
2354232 you know if youve ever seen the vice presidents stationery its on the white house letterhead it may have said ovp office of the vice president i dont remember that so i dont want to mislead you
2354233 this posting is contrary to my practice across 25 years as a journalist but the issues in this matter are simply too important to stand as discredited in any way
2354234 i would say right it came to us george had a raised eyebrow and basically we passed it on it was to and passed this on into the organization
2354235 my source also notes that dick cheney who was behind the forgery hated and mistrusted the agency and would not have used it for such a sensitive assignment
2354236 instead he went to doug feiths office of special plans and asked them to do the job it was feiths office that produced the letter and then surfaced it to the media in iraq unlike the central intelligence agency the pentagon had no restrictions on it regarding the production of false information to mislead the public indeed one might argue that doug feiths office specialized in such activity

2354335 the real genius of the ioc is its ability to create and sustain the myth that it promotes peace in reality trapped by its grandiose goal of embracing the entire human family at whatever cost the ioc has repeatedly caved in and awarded the games to police states bent on staging spectacular festivals that serve only to reinforce their own authority
2354336 the olympic games were founded to bridge cultural divides and promote peace
2354337 what the olympics promote instead is a form of amoral universalism in which all countries are entitled to take part in the games no matter how barbaric their leaders may be
2354338 acting as a catalyst for collaboration between all members of the olympic family
2354339 the sides of the conflict have been playing a kind of cat and mouse game for a couple of years now and theyve always kind of pushed each other to the brink but then pulled back

2354344 if this is a long war georgia will be in a considerable amount of trouble just because its forces are so much smaller it only has about 27 000 soldiers and it would rely also on these militia groups that it is starting to reactivate as well but in a long war georgia would be in trouble

2354359 what youre going to see is a long slow modestly painful recession
2354360 its going to fall heavily on both workers and stock holders who are suffering lower returns as profits come down
2354361 most of the measures suggest that things arent as good as they were 12 months ago but its nothing like 2001 1998 or 1993
2354362 when you say recession it triggers images of 1998 or 1993

2354380 black liberation theology refuses a god who is not identified totally with the goals of the black community
2354381 this is a quote of cone the founder of black liberation theology
2354382 there is no use for a god who loves white oppressors the same as oppressed blacks
2354383 that he would recover and then continue to fight for obama
2354384 i hope shes the candidate because nothing will energize my constituency like hillary clinton if lucifer ran he wouldnt
2354385 when you mention a different opinion the claws come out
2354386 geraldine ferraro is right the way women are treated in this country is more important than this election
2354387 black liberation theology is an understanding of the gospel which sees justice for the poor as the very heart of what the christian gospel is about and the very heart of what god is doing in this world god is taking sides with those who are voiceless and weak and he is empowering them to know that they were not made for slavery not made for exploitation but was made for freedom like everybody else in the world
2354388 black theology will accept only the love of god which participats in the destruction of the white enemy
2354389 there is no use for a god who loves white oppressors the same as oppressed blacks we have had too much of whte love the love that tells blacks to turn the other cheek and go the second mile cone a black theology for liberation p 70
2354390 it was said and eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth but i say love they neighbor as theyself
2354391 they like to use the name of jesus christ and a few selected lines of his teaching but they twist his message of love for all men even for ones enemintes matt 43 22 30 7 12 and gal 6 10
2354392 if god is not for us and against white people then he is a murderer and we had better kill him the task of black theology is to kill gods who do not belong to the black community black theology will accept only the love of god which participates in the destruction of the white enemy
2354393 i think the time has come for black theologians and church people to move beyond a mere reaction to white racism in america and begin to extend our vision of a new socially constructed humanity in the whole inhabited world for humanity is whole and cannot be isolated into racial and national groups

2354395 a principal advantage of linspire its codec licensing agreement with microsoft no longer applies
2354396 with the linspire acquisition we had three desktop brands and two distinct code bases from joint discussions with our respective engineering teams it made eminent sense to combine our efforts with a single code base and two brands
2354397 freespire is returning to debian because we need to build all of our desktop products upon a single code base
2354398 xandros has always worked closely with the debian community where the emphasis is stability and consistency over the bleeding edge besides its not that big a switch since ubuntu is based on debian as well

2354401 john edwards was not aware that assistance was provided to anyone involved in this matter
2354402 i did it of my own voilition and without the knowledge instruction or suggestion of john edwards or anyone else the assistance was offered and accepted without condition

2354405 we know of locations where not only was our product not there but it would have had no function there yet in case after case baron amp budd sues us and gets product id and comes up with at least three or four co workers who identify the product
2354406 each description goes well beyond what one would think necessary to refresh the memory of someone who had actually worked with the product instead the memo appears to anticipate that clients will not have any previous familiarity with the product
2354407 you will be asked if you ever saw any warning labels on containers of asbestos
2354408 keep in mind that defense attorneys are very young and were not present at the jobsites you worked at
2354409 what i was doing was fraudulent there was never any doubt in my mind about it
2354410 how about theyre talking to each other on their cbs the oncomming lane is telling them what happened and which lane is moving
2354411 he was hunted down and shot in the back while he fled
2354412 the birth certificate establishes the existence of the child weve all seen the child so theres no doubt about it so what is the problem in issuing her birth certificate
2354413 without the birth certificate we cant apply for a travel document that would enable her to get a visa and leave the country and be with her family which is the final aim of what we are working for
2354414 we couldnt have allowed the two babies to be fed by the same woman as that might have passed on manjhis infection to the other child the foster mother is trying to help but that could have put her own child in danger that is why we have asked the lady not to breastfeed manjhi any longer
2354415 the doctor only said my son had less blood in his body they didnt tell me if he suffered from any disease
2354416 there are many primary health centres that only have one medical officer mothers are themselves so malnourished thats why they give birth to malnourished children
2354417 these deaths have nothing to do with malnutrition during the monsoons children get infected and succumb to diseases

2354423 we are very careful in the anc not to be seen as another african country that changes laws just to suit us we cant focus only on the short term we must look at what this would mean for the future
2354424 so far we have resisted using our two thirds majority to change laws which do not suit us or are uncomfortable for us
2354425 the nec is not united around what route to take because of the different perspectives people have
2354426 it was a political decision since his removal from office we have been of the view that there is no case against him
2354427 we need to find a political solution for him so much injustice has been done to him every move by the npa is hell bent on destroying him
2354428 some people feel president sylvio berlusconi in italy has just done it and that it could be done here they feel its better to have legal provisions that allow for the five year suspension of charges while the guy is president than to have the institutions and the courts undermined and the independence of the judiciary put constantly under threat as they are currently
2354429 will cause a hoo ha because you are using the parliamentary majority to do it
2354430 and we have to make it clear that you can only have this protection while you are sitting president this is not the united states where you can never be charged this is the chirac option where former french president jacques chirac is now being charged for offences allegedly committed while he was still mayor of paris
2354431 comment and criticism must be informed and thoughtful not reactionary and alarmist because that would tend to undermine the rule of law such criticism also has the potential to weaken confidence in the judiciary and without public confidence the judicial system loses its legitimacy and cannot operate effectively
2354432 we cannot have a judicial system that acts in the manner which our courts have acted
2354433 no amount of threat will intimidate cosatu from talking about the conduct of the judiciary we are not going to be told that judges are angels they take decisions under the influence of liquor
2354434 was going down the dangerous route of becoming a banana republic
2354435 how do we explain this long lapse and the suddenly renewed post 2007 activism of theirs in the light of the need for revolutionary consistency on matters of justice and human rights
2354436 being collusive to a perpetual assassination of human rights and justice in this country
2354437 the judiciary is living in its own elitist lagoon away from the reality of south african society in fact it has almost become a judicial cabal subtly colluding with one another and sending particular signals on its course of action
2354438 being a real life princess youre someone to be reckoned with now make me a sandwich
2354439 mobile satellite services have the tremendous advantage of being able to cover most of the eus territory thereby reaching millions of eu citizens across borders they represent an unprecedented opportunity for all europeans to access new communication services and this not only in metropolitan areas but also in rural and less populated regions
2354440 however these satellite services depend on substantial investment and therefore need simple and swift procedures as well as long term legal certainty this is why the commission in close cooperation with the european parliament and the council of ministers set up in a record time of only ten months a single eu procedure for selecting interested operators of mobile satellite services there is now one market not 27 in europe for mobile satellite services henceforth the ball is in the camp of the industry i expect intense competition among operators offering satellite based communication services reaching consumers from the north of sweden to the south of spain this could pave the way for first satellite launches already in the course of 2009

2354588 these guidelines though not a law are binding on all the private practitioners in the country who are dealing in art and the same were required to be followed we have not taken note of the foreign nationals when these guidelines were issued
2354589 these guidelines were sent to each state government as the health is a state subject but unfortunately none of the states ever tried to religiously abide by the guidelines nor ever tried to have a law on surrogation
2354590 however looking at the reluctance of the states the central government is now proposing to have a composite bill on the issue which has been forwarded to the concerned minister this week after the issue was highlighted in the media
2354591 it will frustrate the purpose of inter country adoption in the country and millions of orphans and deserted children will not be able to be located in a family atmosphere
2354592 in the anand case guidelines have not been followed and the agreement is merely a sham to cover up the business of renting the womb of a poor female it will diminish the social values to vanishing point in india
2354593 a person with infertility only knows the pain of not having a child since the guidelines have not taken care of surrogation by nris and foreign nationals we have made specific provisions in this regard in the bill sent to the minister
2354594 surrogation cannot be blamed to cause miscarriage of inter country adoption system in the country rather it will increase the reproductive tourism in the country even other countries are having it

2354606 the supreme court cannot prevent parliament from discharging its constitutional responsibilities it is purely a constitutional matter

2354612 a black market of illegal transplants flourishes in many countries and not just in asia
2354613 poor clinical results for many patients and exploitation of many in poverty
2354614 we must therefore take a practical approach criminalising organ trading does not eliminate it but it merely breeds a black market with the middleman creaming off the bulk of the compensation which the grateful patient is willing to offer the donor
2354615 basic instinct of kidney failure patients to try to live
2354616 life in the spotlight must be grand but for the rest of us times are tough obama voted to raise taxes on people making just 42 000
2354617 they have no legal right to keep either of those
2354618 there is nothing wrong with watersports its not an obscene activity its something that lots of gay couples participate in and fisting our court case 10 years ago proved that fisting is not an obscene activity

2354620 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2354621 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices
2354622 with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly
2354623 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2354624 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2354625 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false
2354626 used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it
2354627 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2354628 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2354629 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter it is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen
2354630 i am only concerned with the lie had he been a repub we would have had posts numbering in the high 70s by this time
2354631 i am not going to bother and go back several months ago but i am willing to wager cash you and many others went off the handles with the senator in the bathroom the gay congress guy with the interns etc

2354636 which is why sen obama needs all of us he needs us working for him
2354637 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all
2354638 were going to have a very clear message about how the campaign will cooperate and how the convention will be conducted when its appropriate to make that announcement
2354639 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2354640 you could argue that no ones ever ready to be president i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year you could argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can ever be fully ready for the pressures of the office and that everyone learns something and something different you could argue that

2354668 were extremely positive about the future prospects of linux and open source but we cant slack off and we cant forget about those who still might arise to try to slow or reverse the progress that has been made
2354669 we have got to ensure we dont create a dangerous precedent that the surgeons doing the big complex cases arent discouraged from taking them on
2354670 surgeons would be quite anxious about using these measures in this way
2354671 they wouldnt be confident the data is robust enough or that it reflects the mix of patients and activity that they deal with i dont think surgeons will buy into this
2354672 patients will be horrified there is a real risk that the most complicated cases as well as the patients in real need will be forgotten because they dont get the best outcomes doctors already have a duty to provide high quality care i think a good doctor would be insulted by the idea that they will only do their best on the operating table if there is extra money in it
2354673 whose side effects on the body have yet to be properly assessed
2354674 this ad is a lie and its part of the old tired politics of a party in washington that has run out of ideas and run out of steam
2354675 this ad is a lie and its part of the old tired politics of a party in washington that has run out of ideas and run out of steam
2354676 if you believe in the constitution and you believe in what this country means you can not believe that any american should ever face prison for writing fiction no matter what the subject matter of that fiction might be
2354677 there is no quality of life perspective to this just a number
2354678 studies have estimated that by 2020 healthcare expenditure will triple
2354679 if i give you this drug your quality of life will improve
2354680 would you hold to your position if this patient were repeatedly admitted into hospital and spent long periods in the ward convalescing
2354681 has learned that the obama campaign in an effort to quiet talk of the obama clinton drama has offered bill clinton a speaking role on wednesday night at the democratic convention before the vice presidential running mate
2354682 they wont do anything about it they already released him from jail
2354683 if you allow trading currently those who volunteer for the family members or under hota they may then object and say since you can now buy organs then why should i volunteer to save my family members
2354684 within the council itself we had a debate and the views were split down the middle as well between those who felt that there could be a possibility of legalising it because of the good it can bring to the recipients the quality of life saving a life
2354685 however the other point that we still felt was very important is how are you able to administer it the devil is in the details
2354686 it may but the voice for legalising organ trade is not something thats a current topic
2354687 long term risks are if you have two kidneys and you donated one what do you do when something happens to you some accident or some illness then youve got no back up plan and its well documented that organ donors do suffer from what we call donor remorse
2354688 there are so many things that can possibly happen that even if you want to think about ways to put safeguards in to prevent illegal activities from happening there are a lot of details that have to be worked out
2354689 the human body itself cannot be treated like a commercial property that it can be traded with a value
2354690 how are you able to administer it the devil is in the details
2354691 there are medical complications the short term risks are the operation itself anaesthesia for both the recipient and the donor in the surgery
2354692 if you have two kidneys and you donated one what do you do when something happens to you some accident or some illness then youve got no back up plan
2354693 sma council members have a discussion among themselves and it is supposed to be representative of all their members views
2354694 having a fixed price might price out poorer patients from having a transplant
2354695 subsidize i think we know where that slippery slope leads us to
2354696 what price is right a price that is cheap to a multi millionaire will be criticized as being too cheap or unfair to the donor a price too expensive will be unfair to the poorer recipients
2354697 if there were a group of questionable donations all with the name abdullah that were funneled through a guy in jordan who is a jordanian national who is under investigation for war profiteering and it were barack obama instead of john
2354698 a little bit expensive but we want to get one house where we want to stay and build a family in
2354699 just take it easy i can help first lets make sure hes dead
2354700 people who farm now are not doing this for laughs despite the fact hollywood still thinks that theyre doing it to make a lot of money
2354701 they come into our own national parks and risk the lives of sheriffs and others
2354702 cannot be observed under lab conditions vaildated sic nor replicated
2354703 basically falsifying id through lab experiments can be rules out the time scales are just way to huge the fossil records may say something but the gaps in them are quit large
2354704 on the other hand more knowledge of gene regulatory networks will support intelligent design
2354705 btw dont quite get how knowledge about gene regulatory networks are suppose to support the theory of evolution through natural selection gene regulatory networks connect genes to cell biology but dont explain the distribution of genes
2354706 its alway been with an open mind that the human race as a species has
2354707 this is a regular trumped up charge by religious nutjobs and their apologists that atheists and or scientists are arrogant and not unlike
2354708 i believe in an open mind but not so open that your brains fall out
2354709 anything is possible its just the degrees of possibility unless theres concrete proof no point shutting the door your ball
2354710 i suppose that you think that creationism is dead wrong which it is then
2354711 perhaps you can highlight some reasons why creationism is more compelling for you
2354712 religious nutjobs hmmm is that term even unbiased and well do a count keeping track of the trail is getting boring anyway
2354713 you brought this up you cant offer the proof i asked for so its suddenly boring and now want to change the rules of your game
2354714 want to investigate the existence of garden gnomes who inhabit english country gardens recounted in childrens fables
2354715 you seem to insist that just because some ideas exist they are somehow equally likely to be true so what are the reasons why creationism is more compelling for you why cant we just ignore it
2354716 truth be told i never bothered much about whether its true or not
2354717 whatever gave you the idea that i believe in creationism that much
2354718 truth be told i never bothered much about whether its true or not its the arguements and reasonings of the different camps that interest me
2354719 truth be told i never bothered much about whether its true or not
2354720 what you are admitting is that truth fact or fiction is unimportant to you you just like arguing
2354721 developmental models describe genes to phenotype there is no feedback via a selection process
2354722 given a new virus x that ravaged large chunks of human population can we determine if x was a natural virus or an intelligently designed one the response of course would be different based on the answer
2354723 how the heck you can put id into the same theoretical framework in something that is so empirical is beyond me
2354724 lets be clear as to what kind of intelligent design we are talking about 1 human intelligent design hid 2 alien intelligent design aid 3 transcendental intelligent design tid i always speak about id in the sense of 1 and 2 here id in the sense of 3 is boring
2354725 i know but smearing is not an argument hence i cant make argument against it
2354726 our strategy has been to change the subject a bit so that we can get the issue of intelligent design which really means the reality of god before the academic world and into the schools
2354727 this isnt really and never has been a debate about science its about religion and philosophy
2354728 do you need a creator to do the creating or can nature do it on its own
2354729 creationism in any of its forms such as intelligent design is not based on facts does not use any scientific reasoning and its contents are pathetically inadequate for science classes
2354730 if you think about doing the unthinkable you can the skys the limit thats one thing ive learned from bob anythings possible
2354731 its rare to be able to find a coach athlete combination that works so well
2354732 more than an athlete coach combination were friends we have so much love and passion about what we do
2354733 weve had our bad communication here and there but we tend to do well
2354734 the biggest challenge with michael is making sure im one step ahead of him
2354735 its little things bobs car was a stick shift thats how i learned i always had trouble and i remember going to school one day and we were on a hill at a busy intersection and of course i stalled in the middle of the hill there were tons of people behind me i still dont know how to drive a stick
2354736 the male white was lying on his sofa inserting a claw hammer covered with a plastic bag into his rectum
2354737 it is so hot that you can even smell your own hair burning
2354738 to me the most important concept in science is the testable prediction equipped with supporting evidence from facts and a explanatory framework from theories we can then proceed to make precise daring predictions
2354739 post hoc analysis design and analysis of experiments refers to looking at the data after the experiment has concluded for patterns that were not specified a priori it is also known as data dredging to evoke the sense that the more one looks the more likely something will be found
2354740 and yet in a simplified analogy we can apply any of newtons 3 laws and know what we will get in the end ball goes up ball comes down etc thats the main difference
2354741 and with evolutionary theory the prediction is that a missing link in the fossil record can be and have been found
2354742 were discovering new things about the world around us all the time galileo was ostracized so was darwin when some other scientist births a new theory that is totally at odds with darwinism id creationism and other known theories will history repeat itself or will we be more open to accept these new findings
2354743 id is creationism relabeled it is a religious belief masquerading as a scientific theory
2354744 creationists believe everything was created and over and done with in the past fullstop
2354745 i suppose that you think that creationism is dead wrong which it is then
2354746 ps evolution was brought up as an analogy its funny how it has overtaken this blog as a hot topic
2354747 as for the priests believing in things without evidence thats a whole cartload of theology that will blow all our heads a way theres already loads of discussion on the net as to what they believe is real or not and both sides make some valid comments but it is ultimately unprovable because there literally no higher authority to confirm whether what they believe is true or not to say they are wrong merely means you have a set of beliefs different from them and whatever evidence they give you will be viewed with skepticism exactly why scientists in olden days believed for so long that the earch could not possibly be round and was not the center of the universe
2354748 very strange that you should fail to mention any of these alternative theories
2354749 and it seems that you are saying that the earth is in the centre of the universe
2354750 not sure how many scientists nowadays will claim that maybe you can name a few
2354751 maybe thats because i wasnt the one to bring in creationism and id in the first place
2354752 to say they are wrong merely means you have a set of beliefs different from them and whatever evidence they give you will be viewed with skepticism exactly why scientists in olden days believed for so long that the earch could not possibly be round and
2354753 which is what ive kept repeating what goes for science now may not necessarily be true tomorrow
2354754 no you didnt answer it i dont think that plato and aristotle were flat earthers do you know where to check this up
2354755 i take it you mean that the correct view is opposite to their beliefs
2354756 i am always open to new scientific theories i dont see much point in constantly re evaluating discredited ideas though
2354757 look at what we are capable of achieving now gm food clones etc intelligent design
2354758 its not that nice actually volcanoes earthquakes tsunamis occasionally meteorite impact to wipe out most species
2354759 the only planets where life can originate and evolve are those that have the right conditions to allow life to originate and evolve to see life and evolution and claim creation or design is therefore an unfalsifiable proposition
2354760 of course there is a possibility that an invisible entity created life or designed the universe in a way which allows life to begin and designed a set of rules for evolution and then applied the pressures to force species to evolve one way or another according to his or her design
2354761 how similar to to see different skeletons and claim evolution is therefore an unfalsifiable preposition touche
2354762 and im sure you were around when the life evolved to say whether a guiding hand was around or not
2354763 whether it is infalsible or not is only due to our inability now to collect data to prove it so or otherwise im sure science will progress in the future to tell us more
2354764 until then an open mind is the only thing that ensures we will not throw out any theory or hypothesis that might in the future turn out to be right
2354765 except there is more to evolution than fossils we have a good understanding of how the mechanics of evolution work and we have observed and replicated evolution in the lab setting
2354766 but surely you must admit that currently we have no good evidence on the nature of either or how we should model our lives and society based on our knowledge of the two
2354767 which does not pre clude the possibility that the bacterias dna did not already have encoded
2354768 who said anything about modelling our lives or society based on these theories
2354769 of course everything that i did not witness not happen must have happened
2354770 or maybe just maybe its our knowledge and ability to capture evidence that is limited
2354771 i wanna be the guy you can lay your feet on when you have a long day and i can rub them i wanna be the person who takes you places you never been somethin somethin somethin
2354772 i didnt wish it to happen i was extremely depressed and upset after being
2354773 if i start using my mind be self conscious of the risks a lot of catholics would suffer i would become neurotic if im afraid of being sued
2354774 n othing is said to be done or believed in good faith which is done or believed without due care and attention
2354775 if i start using my mind be self conscious of the risks a lot of catholics would suffer i would become neurotic if im afraid of being sued
2354776 what matters more would be what exactly did the priests and other church staff do for or to the plaintiff that day and whether those things led to the illness that the plaintiff claims to be suffering from
2354777 rather sad the way they spend time over semantics and not the essentials of the case
2354778 a woman and her family of a different faith goes to a temple or mosque to pray instead throws a scene in a sacred place her family requests the imam or temple priest to pray for the person what should the priest or imam do
2354779 are you denying the role and function of the priest in society
2354780 maybe you had very little religious education or maybe you have a deep abhorrence to catholic christian beliefs good if you can find out more about christianity
2354781 the concept of the son of god becoming man might be too much for your human mind to comprehend but if you seek the truth you will find it
2354782 last but not least try to be respectful of all religions especially on the internet
2354783 i said you did all these acts you said no i asked why you said you did not get permission from the bishop
2354784 the whole package must be followed it cannot be set as an exorcism
2354785 the substance is what we are interested in not the form
2354786 would you agree that the signs displayed by the plaintiff were more severe than these examples
2354787 nothing wrong with that angrydoc its called the placebo effect
2354788 now considering that people pray for each other all the time and sometimes do pray in groups as well by your and the plaintiffs lawyers understanding that mean mass exorcisms are being held all the time
2354789 whichever the case the priests assumed she was possessed when they could not reasonably have known that she was
2354790 in fact since there is no evidence at all that she was possessed
2354791 actually for the priests to prove they did nothing wrong they just need to prove that a there is already something wrong with her i e her condition was not caused by what happened or b shes faking her condition or a combination of both
2354792 there isnt a need to question the issue of belief behind the case because the case is all about alleged cause and effect
2354793 a prayer is akeen to someone offering you a consoling pat on the shoulder when you tell him her someone close to you just died
2354794 when i said a prayer is like a pat its as a comparison with an exorcism hence the pat vs punch in the analogy
2354795 from that perspective i would say her diety is offended that she seeked help from someone other that he her itself and is now tormenting her for it which seems more logical if not feasible
2354796 ok i can see how a pat can be like a prayer because it is meant to make you feel better but how is an exorcism like a punch
2354797 in which case the plaintiff should seriously consider suing her family since they initiated this whole serious of events by bringing her to the church requesting help on her behalf and leading to her current situation
2354798 people try to help you out of a good heart you think the priest trying to purposely harm you meh
2354799 here the priest assumed prayer done in the manner described was suitable when it was obviously not
2354800 what is the catholic priest supposed to be a doctor can make diagnosis of psychiatric conditions
2354801 i think you guys are blowing this way out of proportion
2354802 its like approving your leg to be amputated then suing the hospital for doing what they did based on your orders
2354803 if she wants to wayang the priests could have said a simple
2354804 2 imagine yourself as a catholic priest sitting in a catholic church and you get a person who comes in with signs suggestive of
2354805 the priests may win the case but that does not change the fact that their belief system is partly responsible for getting them into the case to begin with
2354806 the fact remains that in this case the priests assume possession and acted accordingly to the point that they physically restrained her why did they jump to that conclusion
2354807 she could have bumped into any random joe and claim that person traumatized her could she not
2354808 religion is not an issue since she squeezed singtel telecom for 30k as well
2354809 for the simple fact that they had to prevent her from hurting herself or others
2354810 where she was previously a healthy active person her own lawyers words saying she was a national runner and such brought to a back room and held for hours an not allowed to leave and her current condition was because of what had happened in the church
2354811 religion is not the issue belief in things without evidence is
2354812 the belief in things without evidence was what made the priests do the things that made it possible for this case to come this far
2354813 2 i do not believe the priests had any valid reason to believe that the plaintiff was possessed or that prayer would have helped her
2354814 its like seeing person collaped on the floor do you run a background check on him before offering help or do you just go ahead
2354815 as for the priests believing in things without evidence thats a whole cartload of theology that will blow all our heads a way
2354816 but it is ultimately unprovable because there literally no higher authority to confirm whether what they believe is true or not
2354817 to say they are wrong merely means you have a set of beliefs different from them and whatever evidence they give you will be viewed with skepticism
2354818 exactly why scientists in olden days believed for so long that the earch could not possibly be round and was not the center of the universe
2354819 if you see a man collapsed on the floor do you straight away perform cpr on him
2354820 scientists did not believe the earth was flat or that it was the centre of the universe religious people who based their beliefs on authority and not observation and evidence did scientists proved them wrong
2354821 so you say but more likely its unacceptable to you
2354822 evidence that life cannot have started without some outside influence that is beyond our meagre powers to understand and replicate
2354823 there is no concrete evidence that evolution happened either only
2354824 what you believe to be good science now may not be in the future
2354825 btw did you know einstein and stephen hawkings believed in a god though not necessarily in a strict bible sense
2354826 evolution is a scientific theory based on observed facts the theory of evolution explains observed phenomena but it cannot predict outcomes with certainty evolution will never become a law so your comparison with the law of gravity is flawed
2354827 it is not important whether einstein and hawkings believe in god they do not in the biblical sense as you mentioned but whether they or anyone else you may care to mention have evidence to support a belief in the existence of god
2354828 clearly overly biased ive worked in the wards before and dealt with violent patients as well i dont see how different it is in the hospitals versus what the reports said the family and the priests did maybe no haloperidol so makes the problem more prolonged nevertheless we dont take consent from the patient when he jab the im halo u guys smack of elitism doctors are great priests are crap sigh
2354829 there is no concrete evidence that evolution happened either only
2354830 they remain open minded enough to accept the possibility of it because there is no irrifutable evidence to suggest whether one or the other is the absolute truth
2354831 so what is the priest supposed to do when the lady turns violent not restrain and just tell her to go to the hospital
2354832 so evolution is not a law when you dont want it to be but there are laws of evolution which the scientific community
2354833 too often the call to be open minded is an excuse used by those with no evidence to support a claim to not have to supply evidence they call for others to suspend judgement while there is no evidence but at the same time they do not themselves susepnd their promotion of their beliefs
2354834 and here you are calling others to believe that there is no god god goddess etc without being able to supply evidence to that effect
2354835 i wouldnt believe that a 5 legged human exists until someone shows me yet i do not need to prove that i dont believe that a 5 6 7 legged human is possible
2354836 it is however important that if someone believes that bigfoot unicorns fairies and god exists they prove it
2354837 and you just used one when it suited your purpose and then the other when the situation evolved i understand you were just being open minded
2354838 me telling people to not believe in things without evidence when i cant produce evidence for the absence of evidence yes i shouldnt tell people not to believe in unicorns until i cant find a unicorn wait or should that be until i find a unicorn i am confused
2354839 organ trading often involves the exploitation of the poor and socially disadvantaged donors who are unable to make an informed choice and suffer potential medical risks
2354840 we have to see aids as a disease clouding the issue with the morality aspects only impedes the treatment and prevention of the disease
2354841 organ trading often involves the exploitation of the poor and socially disadvantaged donors who are unable to make an informed choice and suffer potential medical risks
2354842 some of these educated people who are in need of money may die anyway if they dont get the money
2354843 whether doctors should subject the lives of healthy people to risk for no physical benefits to them
2354844 well then how do your deal with the moralities of drug trials
2354845 well if its any comfort i suspect the ethical issues revolving around a human donor will all be moot in our life time with the advent of first human compatible animal organs and then
2354846 the defaultbutton of panel1 must be the id of a control of type ibuttoncontrol
2354847 a mixture of rice protein powder and a small amount of activated charcoal
2354848 0 3 hypericin free of heavy metals pesticides and adulterants
2354849 of course that begs the question of how they then know if their results are in fact placebo effects
2354850 in the hypertension eg wouldnt it make more sense if the placebo is nothing
2354851 if the placebo is active how do they make the deduction that any observed difference is due to the tested drug
2354852 correct but itss also possible you also dont know otherwise right
2354853 bigdog is the alpha male of the boston dynamics family of robots it is a quadruped robot that walks runs and climbs on rough terrain and carries heavy loads bigdog is powered by a gasoline engine that drives a hydraulic actuation system bigdogs legs are articulated like an animals and have compliant elements that absorb shock and recycle energy from one step to the next bigdog is the size of a large dog or small mule measuring 1 meter long 0 7 meters tall and 75 kg weight
2354854 the company says in its filing that it intends to use the net proceeds from its ipo for capital expenditures working capital and other general corporate purposes including the expansion of manufacturing facilities repayment of approximately 2 5 million in debt research and development and sales and marketing expansion it might also use some of the funds for acquisitions and other means of growing its business according to the filing
2354855 count me in for womens economic independence has launched a new program to expose young women in high school and college to entrepreneurial career paths the program make our daughters a million debuted at the make mine a million business event in newark n j on june 3 2008 participants ranged in age from 13 to 20 many of whom already had ventures under way such as a 13 year old girl with her own jewelry and beading business the girls met successful women business owners learned confidence building tips and talked about goal setting networking and money
2354856 since partnering again in the summer of 2005 the founders of fantasia fresh juice co sold to naked juice in 2000 have moved quickly to get their drinktab revolution out to consumers inspired by the success of airborne tablets the duo created effervescent drink tablets they dissolve in water to create a colorful fizzy beverage which theyre marketing to both teens and young adults as high energy vitamin packed beverages
2354857 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2354858 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2354859 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2354860 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2354861 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2354862 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2354863 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2354864 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2354865 the united states and russia must take the lead in striving to abolish nuclear weapons
2354866 these two countries should begin implementing broad reductions of nuclear weapons instead of deepening their conflict over among others the introduction of a missile defence system in europe
2354867 there can be no assurance that impairment charges will not be required in the future and any such amounts may be material
2354868 with moon we have focused most of our attention on the gunplay challenging the player to use their weapons carefully and strafing to be most effective against the hostiles
2354869 adding a jump element to the game would have divided our gameplay focus in order to present the player with interesting ways of utilizing the jump so it didnt feel like an afterthought and may have diluted the overall experience focusing on one thing and trying to make it good is usually the best thing to do rather than do many things only to an ok quality
2354870 weve focused on high action gameplay challenges that we hope will really test the players skills a challenge wont be just a case of unloading a bunch of bullets into a heavily armored stationary enemy instead were hoping to take the player off guard with interesting enemy placement and behaviors so the player finds that they need to stay alert and pay attention to their surroundings in order to survive
2354871 to balance this hectic pace of gameplay moon also has some exploration aspects that may allow you to access a new area or reward you with a tasty treat were tuning the game to be a considerable challenge on normal difficulty while also giving the choice of rookie and veteran difficulty settings for different levels of player experiences and play styles

2354873 en las horas del crep sculo cuando la oscuridad suele ser tanta que ni siquiera nos vemos realizo una especie de ejercicio de memoria por ejemplo le pregunto por epicuro arist teles cu nteme qui n fue y me cuenta cosas durante una hora de tal manera que siempre lamento que no lo escuche ninguna persona culta y erudita que pudiera replicarle de manera an loga

2354877 the fishermen are well protected and it would not be possible for sri lankan navy to fire at them in indian waters
2354878 if they open fire at our fishermen in indian waters it will be disastrous for the sri lankan navy but if the indian fishermen were fired at in sri lankan waters we cannot do anything about it
2354879 the fishermen should not cross the international maritime boundary line imbl the fishermen would definitely not have any problem if they fish here

2354883 we will boycott the delegation as mehbooba farooq and saifuddin soz are part of the team they are responsible for amarnath land issue
2354884 we call on russia to cease air and missile attacks on georgia respect its territorial integrity and withdraw the ground combat forces from georgian soil
2354885 the us is working actively with its european partners to launch international mediation we urgently seek russias support of these efforts
2354886 we underscore the international communitys support for georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders as articulated in numerous un security council resolutions
2354887 in view of russias past provocative actions in south ossetia including the recent overflight of the region by its warplanes on july 8th moscow has a particular obligation to avoid further escalation of the situation
2354888 i am eager to see this crisis resolved quickly and peacefully through diplomacy not violence the us should engage immediately with georgia a close us partner and russia at the highest levels and insist the forces of both countries stand down now
2354889 the government of georgia has called for a cease fire and for resumption of direct talks on south ossetia with international mediators the us should immediately convene an emergency session of the security council to call on russia to reverse course
2354890 for years russia has armed and supported separatist movements along its border with georgia this is yet another instance of russias bullying of its neighbours and denotes the increasingly aggressive nature of russian foreign policy
2354891 we are now trying to control khartoum god willing we will take power its just a matter of time
2354892 the data collected through this project will assist designers and engineers in developing more sophisticated assistive aids for individuals suffering from various neuromuscular diseases and musculoskeletal injuries
2354893 better orthotic technologies could ultimately help people suffering from this disease greatly enhance the quality of their life
2354894 a big challenge for biological therapeutics is that they are broken down rapidly in the body the technology developed by asterion ltd is based on basic structural biology work that has provided us with the knowledge necessary to develop longer acting drugs this is a major advantage for patients as it means monthly injections rather than daily injections
2354895 our patented and versatile therapeutic platform technology profuse tm could also tackle major diseases such as some cancers anaemia infertility and diabetes under normal circumstances hormones of the type known as cytokine hormones growth hormone for example circulate in the blood and are bound to proteins that prevent them from being degraded the basic structural biology work we have done in the past means that we can see the interaction between the hormone and the binding protein in exquisite detail our understanding of this structural information means that we can rationally design drugs that consist of this pairing of hormone and binding protein that still allows them to activate the cell surface receptor in this situation the hormone portion of the drug is better protected in the circulation from degradation and so it has a much longer effective life in the body
2354896 its exciting because weve found a compound in nature that may one day surpass a currently marketed drug or could become the structural template for rationally designed drugs with improved selectivity
2354897 the ocean is a genetically distinct environment and the single most diverse source of new molecules to be discovered
2354898 i dont have pet peeves i have major psychotic hatreds
2354899 ive learned a lot become a better professional and a better man because of my experience and my time in new york i dont regret or feel ashamed about anything that happened to me in my time in new york
2354900 the most difficult part is just the realization that the organization no longer wants you
2354901 you spend eight years there and in the blink of an eye youre no longer wanted there
2354902 i threw the ball a lot better than the linescore said
2354903 i just really got outpitched theres nothing really more to say
2354904 that last start i was trying to get out alive
2354905 i didnt care if i gave up 100 runs that game i was so beat out there i was so exhausted out there
2354906 he was attacking the zone with like nine pitches it seemed like
2354907 when i hit it and drew caught it i didnt know where it went
2354908 i thought it kicked away from him just trying to make something positive here hoping we can get a run to score o c did a good job reading the throws
2354909 once he got out of that jam it affected the rest of the night
2354910 he did a good job coming back at us and pitching seven strong innings we didnt do much to him
2354911 he doesnt bother me as much as some of the other guys
2354912 when i pitch i try to think the other team is the best in baseball
2354913 can feel the difference see a little more life on the ball
2354914 scott seems to have a v12 engine castroneves said after watching dixon grab the pole for the meijer indy 300 on saturday at kentucky speedway
2354915 its been pretty tough the last couple of weekends said dixon tied for second on the career indycar series pole list with 13
2354916 weve missed a little bit on qualifying hopefully it looks like the car is pretty strong this week
2354917 missed during qualifying recently shows just how dominant his car has been all season the indy 300 marks the 12th straight race dixon will start in the top 10
2354918 we probably should have a lot bigger lead than weve got right now dixon said
2354919 weve to do what were capable of and hopefully the last four races we can string out that lead a little bit more
2354920 its still like 60 points its still 200 points in the game and what we need to do is just keep pushing as hard as we can
2354921 now its about going out there taking chances and trying to make some gains
2354922 definitely if i win some questions are going to stop so thats good meira said
2354923 ok but admitted a lack of track time the last two months has them scrambling to keep up fisher set the track record while winning the pole here in 2002
2354924 there were some research and development things we wanted to try in the trailer but we just didnt have the time she said
2354925 our target is for a top 10 obviously if we could come away with that wed feel great
2354926 its kind of like ive been given a clean piece of paper a clean slate said miller whose well known emotions caused him to pause several times as he described the last two months
2354927 it was really neat just getting in the car at the hospital knowing i was going home miller said
2354928 i would like to have him involved he is too good a resource not to greg miller said
2354929 what can i say i havent got the focus this week obviously im still just having a hangover after winning the open
2354930 i played poorly and im bitterly disappointed about it the south african said
2354931 ive been fighting with my swing ive got the double miss going missing left and right i really need to figure out what im going to do with my long game
2354932 its not a complaint but theyre on the verge of dying mediate said
2354933 its like i forgot how to play golf i looked like a 20 handicap
2354934 my whole intention for the year was to make the team austin said
2354935 the ryder cup is not this week said azinger who will announce his picks sept 2 in new york
2354936 im going to call shannon and tell her to put away the sharp objects azinger joked
2354937 every expert that ive heard in the last month has said that paul is going to go with young guys the 44 year old austin said
2354938 ive played one bad tournament in the last three months and thats all anyone is going to remember
2354939 i tossed my club at the bag on the par 3 13th and it must have just caught the plastic part because it dented the shaft said weir who is 8 over after his second round 75
2354940 i didnt three putt a single green with the hybrid and that was after five three putts with the regular one he said
2354941 i might bend my putter to an 18 degree loft tonight maybe thats the way to putt these greens
2354942 ended up with the football trying to make the best out of a bad situation
2354943 the competitor in him probably got the best of him he lowered his shoulder and the end result was a broken collar bone
2354944 i thought our first offense was sharp coming out of the gate that was important to us
2354945 i thought he played really well i liked the poise
2354946 there were so many good things that i saw and a couple bad ones but donovan was a plus
2354947 can be great if we continue to stay healthy and continue to progress
2354948 i think it was awesome that the offensive line did a great job of run blocking
2354949 we threw two passes and they protected very well i think it was a good first drive for us
2354950 it was done he just had to review it and look through it one more time hell be out there for the next one
2354951 its nothing different just going out and trying to make the same plays
2354952 youve got to understand that this is first time in the nfl
2354953 weve all been through that before and understand you kind of have some butterflies and get a bit nervous at times but i thought he handled it well
2354954 the number one reason was because we believe he can help our hockey club and we felt strongly that we missed him last year
2354955 we missed his leadership and his play and his coolness
2354956 he wanted to come back and we wanted him back
2354957 and you obviously dont want to enter into a new contract without resolving the past so we did that
2354958 junior guard patrick beverley will not compete for the razorbacks in the 2008 09 basketball season and offered no further details
2354959 if we cant fix it its done in the garbage
2354960 the blacksmith is for stuff we cant get done outside
2354961 the cost to have a pool of spares for every component would be so great
2354962 they were just around so long they were life extended and then extended and then extended again
2354963 when i first got here that was full of whale oil
2354964 ill let you have a cigarette just remain by the door of the bus so you dont get left behind
2354965 sir you will either die on the gallows or of some unspeakable disease
2354966 he has all the virtues i dislike and none of the vices i admire
2354967 a modest little person with much to be modest about
2354968 i have never killed a man but i have read many obituaries with great pleasure
2354969 he has never been known to use a word that might send a reader to the dictionary
2354970 poor faulkner does he really think big emotions come from big words
2354971 thank you for sending me a copy of your book ill waste no time reading it
2354972 he can compress the most words into the smallest idea of any man i know
2354973 i didnt attend the funeral but i sent a nice letter saying i approved of it
2354974 he has no enemies but is intensely disliked by his friends
2354975 i am enclosing two tickets to the first night of my new play bring a friend if you have one
2354976 cannot possibly attend first night will attend second if there is one
2354977 i feel so miserable without you its almost like having you here
2354978 he is a self made man and worships his creator
2354979 ive just learned about his illness lets hope its nothing trivial
2354980 he is not only dull himself he is the cause of dullness in others
2354981 he is simply a shiver looking for a spine to run up
2354982 they never open their mouths without subtracting from the sum of human knowledge
2354983 in order to avoid being called a flirt she always yielded easily
2354984 he loves nature in spite of what it did to him
2354985 why do you sit there looking like an envelope without any address on it
2354986 his mother should have thrown him away and kept the stork
2354987 some cause happiness wherever they go others whenever they go
2354988 he uses statistics as a drunken man uses lamp posts for support rather than illumination
2354989 fg to gain 2 seats mckenna gain in d central apr 07
2354990 6 7 seats for the pds with cog getting in for 8 on a good day
2354991 i would like to posit the hypothesis that sinn f in fill the space in the irish political party system of the bnp or jean marie le pens front national in france
2354992 she was sort of disturbing other spectators around her which is against the house rules
2354993 democracy and human rights are more important than the olympics
2354994 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2354995 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2354996 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2354997 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2354998 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2354999 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2355000 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2355001 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2355002 todos os treinadores de clubes europeus jorge jesus ao receber o convite penso que teria sido ele o premiado algo que comunicou a alguns jornalistas
2355003 create a single standard of high quality comprehensive and preventive health care for all
2355004 allow freedom of choice of physician hospital and other health care providers
2355005 eliminate financial barriers that prevent families and individuals from obtaining the medically necessary care they need
2355006 allow physicians nurses and other licenced health care providers to make health care decisions based on what is best for the health of the patient
2355007 xbox live arcade needs more games like braid heck gaming on all platforms needs more titles like this imaginative innovative and engrossing braid is a spectacular achievement if only the experience lasted a little longer and there werent as many puzzles with singular solutions despite its short length and robust pricing 15 braid is definitely worth downloading
2355008 levi was gonna stay home but then he said dad mom i wanna go support moms purses

2355011 we were issuing about 10 000 marriage licenses a year but this year we will definitely see a 25 to 30 percent increase

2355020 there has been tremendous excitement from the many artists contributing their voices to these elvis christmas classics we believe elvis fans will truly enjoy these unique collaborations while introducing elvis holiday classics to the many fans of his duet partners
2355021 this is an excellent example of the innovative ways in which we keep elvis catalog fresh for new and existing fans and continue the history of creating preserving and celebrating his great music
2355022 we are so pleased that these accomplished artists are collaborating with elvis in this unique way to make exciting new versions of his christmas songs i am sure elvis would be proud to have worked with them
2355023 weve assembled some of todays top country artists to record a tribute to elvis classic christmas album each track on this special disc will also include samples from the kings original recordings
2355024 to describe or praise publicly usually to promote for sale
2355025 in international relations the influence of russia is returned the place of russia in the world is returned but internally in our moral state we are far from what one would like to be as we organically need
2355026 when they started getting all worked up by a national idea it was nauseating where are you going why are you going there you havent matured enough for it
2355027 this is exactly the kind of up to date information we are looking for we will be liaising to get access to the footage
2355028 you two were at the end of the universe eh right at the edge of knowledge itself and youre busy blogging
2355029 otherwise well have to send him a doctor to clear out all these problems
2355030 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter it is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen
2355031 in one skinny mini monstrosity after another pouty posh beckham can really wreck em
2355032 if you dont take him off the field as a coach he will just about die out there
2355033 that impacted my decision its a michael irvin type work ethic thats what we are talking about with felix jones
2355034 he always demanded that female workers signalled to him with their eyes that they desperately wanted to be laid on the boardroom table as soon as he gave the word
2355035 i didnt realise at first that he wasnt speaking metaphorically
2355036 if we had no sexual harassment we would have no children
2355037 i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness
2355038 you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself
2355039 i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2355040 edwards told abc news correspondent bob woodruff he did have an affair with 44 year old rielle hunter but said that he did not love her
2355041 i also have not been engaged in any activity of any description that requested agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby
2355042 oddly made somewhat easier after her diagnosis of breast cancer in march 2007
2355043 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognised my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness
2355044 although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public when a supermarket tabloid told a version of the story i used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it but being 99 per cent honest is no longer enough
2355045 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices and i had hoped that it would never become public with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly
2355046 but that misconduct took place for a short period in 2006
2355047 i also have not been engaged in any activity of any description that requested agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby
2355048 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
2355049 if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2355050 it has allowed us to take back ownership and allow for community input to the redevelopment of this key main street corridor
2355051 we cannot engage public comment until we complete our obligations to talk with the financial community that process is ongoing
2355052 jonathan dropped and ricco just shot him a couple more times
2355053 have shown that the gaming control board despite its best efforts is not competent to handle the challenging task of examining license applicants backgrounds by itself
2355054 make much of their profits by preying on and deceiving the vulnerable so it is not surprising that this industry should attract people of less than the highest ethical character
2355055 its always better to be conservative in matters like this and certainly with the credit markets as they are it allows us to fully explain and justify the deal
2355056 reserving the option to not move to 5 000 unless market forces warrant it
2355057 essentially gaming revenues are declining in almost every market in the united states currently given that backdrop its difficult to understand why projections for a new property would suddenly become greater today than they were at some point in the past
2355058 a casino in pittsburgh will do quite well but im not convinced that it will do that well
2355059 at first blush this seems to be a reasonable estimate of performance for a casino that has a monopoly in a good sized metropolitan market
2355060 house histories a guide to tracing the genealogy of your home
2355061 the challenge became how to get a high quality real world product from students with little to no formal historic preservation background
2355062 i knew that the class had to be highly structured and thats when i got the idea to model it on the work that i do every day here at pfaffmann
2355063 it was neat to see what discoveries they would come up with every day
2355064 mr and mrs godfrey and their family live in the immense mansion built by mr smith the pipe manufacturer on winebiddle and penn avenues
2355065 decidedly domestic mrs godfrey rarely goes out except in response to calls of missionary or church work she is a baptist to which she is devoted their wealth would reach about the 300 000 figure misses jessie and hattie godfrey the daughters of the house are both bright young ladies the former a musician and the latter something of a beauty
2355066 gave us a great two hours on how to do quality research
2355067 that was the first week of class and he set the stage perfectly for what i wanted to do
2355068 we not only spent a lot of time looking at the history of the building and the people who lived there but also mortar analysis and how the building has physically changed and what is necessary to better preserve it
2355069 the experience of presenting to an audience and having media interviews was invaluable
2355070 that made it much more intense than any other class ive ever taken
2355071 he was very demanding and was very involved in it himself
2355072 he was part of our group and pushed us pretty hard
2355073 we had people on the drafting committee that had been clinton supporters that had been obama supporters by the end we were all in agreement on what should be in the platform
2355074 they did a nice job melding the clinton views and the obama views together not that they were that far apart
2355075 the first woman in american history to win presidential primaries in our nation
2355076 our party is proud to have put 18 million cracks in the highest glass ceiling
2355077 working together we can cut poverty in half within 10 years
2355078 coverage should be made affordable for all americans with direct financial assistance through tax credits and other means
2355079 as affordable coverage is made available individuals should purchase health insurance and take steps to lead healthy lives
2355080 no self respecting women should wish or work for the success of a party that ignores herself

2355093 the language in the ballot title and summary for proposition 8 is argumentative and seeks to negatively affect voters
2355094 since the superior court would not exercise its authority to protect voters against misleading language we will ask the appellate court to do so
2355095 was more about politics than the law the court properly dismissed it
2355096 the test for this court is not whether it can draft a title that is better or more complete
2355097 rather it is whether the attorney generals title which is presumed accurate substantially complies with the law if reasonable minds may differ as to the sufficiency of the attorney generals title the title must be upheld in this case reasonable minds may differ

2355099 in sum following the legislature this court generally condemns noncompetition agreements
2355100 under the statutes plain meaning therefore an employer cannot by contract restrain a former employee from engaging in his or her profession trade or business unless the agreement falls within one of the exceptions to the rule
2355101 all agreements that dont fit into one of the statutory exemptions are by virtue of this decision void
2355102 contrary to andersens belief however california courts have not embraced the ninth circuits narrow restraint exception
2355103 we reject andersens contention that we should adopt a narrow restraint exception to 16600 and leave it to the legislature if it chooses either to relax the statutory restrictions or adopt additional exceptions to the prohibition against restraint rule under 16600
2355104 this is not a surprising opinion i think this is what most practitioners in california expected
2355105 weve reaffirmed the concept of employee mobility in california and employers really need to ensure that their employment agreements are consistent with this decision
2355106 im happy that both sides were able to recognize the value in reaching a resolution at this stage of the case which was somewhat earlier than these cases usually settle
2355107 the involvement of business people on the plaintiffs side really facilitated a settlement they pushed us and the defendants to be realistic about the case
2355108 this case has broader international implications and confirms the importance of allowing international investors access to u s courts when theyve been harmed by securities fraud
2355109 while there were other u s plaintiffs involved german and luxembourg institutions have been running the case
2355110 dekabank participated in every single mediation session much more actively than an awful lot of u s clients that weve got
2355111 i think sometimes courts are a little more skeptical of foreign plaintiffs than they are of u s plaintiffs and this case demonstrated that theres not really any reason for that kind of skepticism
2355112 although it has strong defenses to plaintiffs claims deloitte concluded that it was in the best interests of the firm and its clients to settle this matter now rather than face the burden expense and uncertainty of continued litigation
2355113 mga and ceo isaac larian were entitled to have their case heard by a panel of impartial jurors
2355114 received a verdict from nine impartial jurors and a patently biased one

2355116 as counsel to clearjets schulte was under no duty to make efforts to prevent the departure of a key employee or absent an independent duty to disclose the impending departure to other corporate officers

2355118 there is an implicit message in this opinion to the new jersey legislature to address these eminent domain issues
2355119 they have been talking about it for three years and have not done anything i hope this provides some impetus for them to take action
2355120 its been a very helpful calling card for conversations with potential clients
2355121 to keep the games in the forefront of the minds of our personnel
2355122 i listened to my client give a talk and during his talk he said in 2007 there were 450 cases of enforcement
2355123 by april of this year there were already 500 cases
2355124 interestingly enough there are very few laws in this area
2355125 when i first sat down with one of my partners and said we should go after the beijing olympics the first words out of his mouth were what do they need lawyers for
2355126 i got a frantic phone call from one of my partners in beijing to tell me that this young associate had sat down at a table at this business conference right next to two guys
2355127 we passed all the tests i guess and in the fall of 2002 we signed an engagement letter with them
2355128 we do have one last assignment and that is were working on the windup and dissolution of the organization
2355129 they have to settle out every single claim and they have to do it meticulously
2355130 the statute is not perfect but i think the headline point and just about everybody agrees is that the statute has been extraordinarily effective over the last 22 years
2355131 i take that as a starting point dont fix what aint broke
2355132 the law has been effective but it can be so much more effective
2355133 the amount of money or property paid or approved because of the act of the defendant
2355134 just about every court has said the action must be pleaded with particularity it is not a controversial proposition
2355135 there is nothing in the statute that imposes the 9 b requirement which a number of courts have used to deal a death blow to qui tam suits
2355136 we now have terms and issues defined when you change this law especially with the kind of loose language being thrown about we wont know what the law says again well go through another 20 years of litigation
2355137 cant sell it without us what i assume they would like is for us to give them an epa registration the way to go about doing that is not to sue us

2355148 place appropriate limits on a service based on such criteria as medical necessity or on utilization control procedures
2355149 as authoritatively construed allows for categorical limits on treatments it follows that subdivision 10 of the statute cannot be said to have unambiguously conferred a right upon this plaintiff to a particular service or treatment
2355150 plaintiff has not cited to any authoritative interpretation by the secretary of health and human services supporting her argument
2355151 appropriate limits on a service based on medical necessity or on utilization control procedures
2355152 precludes a finding that the right that this plaintiff invokes is unambiguously conferred by this statute
2355153 i believe very strongly that these records the researchers need belong to the public not to the bar
2355154 im concerned as is everybody about rights of privacy but im highly confident that if the bar provides the records in the way that we had requested that they will be truly anonymous
2355155 this issue was thoroughly vetted last year by the committee of bar examiners and by the full board of governors
2355156 professor sander was given ample opportunity last year to present his case and after listening to significant public comment during a public hearing the board voted unanimously to protect the confidentiality of our test takers
2355157 its just that some people dont want the research to continue to its conclusion because it may be a conclusion that is politically incorrect and that is something that should not even be considered by the state bar

2355242 i wish i could simply wave a magic wand and lower gas prices tomorrow id do that unfortunately higher gas prices are a problem that has been years in the making
2355243 the fundamental source of high gas prices is the fact that supply is not keeping pace with demand to reduce pressure on prices we need to increase the supply of oil especially oil produced here at home so in june i called on congress to lift the legislative ban that prevents offshore exploration of parts of the outer continental shelf or ocs but the leaders of the democratic congress have refused to allow a vote

2355248 sarge was a good player and a terrific guy he had this sort of dry sense of humor that everyone truly enjoyed he was one of those people you couldnt help but enjoy being around
2355249 the fact that sarge was a u s open champion validates the kind of player he was and the fact he battled through local and sectional qualifying to get there reflects in some way the type of person he was sarge contributed a great deal to the game of golf i guess you could say sarge served his country and the game of golf very well
2355250 we are all going to miss sarge who was a patriot first and a professional golfer second

2355307 stringent laws mean you will catch some people but you will not catch terrorism you will catch only terrorists a central agency will ensure the terrorist is not trained he is not indoctrinated and he is not allowed to function laws are meant when the crime is committed we have to deal with that beforehand
2355308 if you study the constitution it talks about law and order as a state subject terrorism is not law and order problem and therefore there is a need for an all party conference in parliament to sort this issue out
2355309 contributions of the team of legal officers who worked tirelessly to prepare singapores case at the international court of justice

2355325 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2355326 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2355327 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2355328 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2355329 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2355330 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2355331 nobody is allowed to participate if they have not had full health and safety training and are not wearing life jackets

2355341 if i found someone who wanted to blow herself up
2355342 id recite a verse from the koran telling her that in allahs eyes suicide is the road to perdition
2355343 for centuries women have been distanced from religion from the pillars of islam
2355344 sometimes its as much about psychology as it is religion
2355345 today when more children are overweight compared with previous generations it can be harder for parents to objectively identify if their child is overweight
2355346 research shows that most parents of overweight or obese children think that their child is a healthy weight some research showed that only 10 of parents with overweight or obese children described their child as overweight
2355347 preliminary findings of the survey suggest that many people who would be defined clinically as obese find the use of the term obese highly offensive and would stop listening to further advice
2355348 to shrink from using the word obesity is really ducking an issue
2355349 it does not have to be used in a judgmental or insulting way if a child is obese then the parents should know that its obese we must make parents know that the lifestyle of the family needs to be modified
2355350 risks and benefits of bmi reporting in the school setting
2355351 our feeling is that the information should be given to parents if there is a serious health concern much like any other health concern a child might have
2355352 this information should not be included on a report card or such medical information should be kept separate
2355353 the government must lead on action across society to tackle obesity engaging parents in this issue is essential to achieving success in instigating behavioral change

2355357 to advocate isolationism today therefore is to aid albeit unconsciously the communist grand design of world domination
2355358 w e have here a political force committed fanatically to the belief that with the u s there can be no permanent modus vivendi that it is desirable and necessary that the internal harmony of our society be disrupted our traditional way of life be destroyed the international authority of our state be broken if soviet power is to be secure
2355359 soviet pressure against the free institutions of the western world is something that can be contained by the adroit and vigilant application of counterforce at a series of constantly shifting geographical and political points corresponding to the shifts and maneuvers of soviet policy but which cannot be charmed or talked out of existence
2355360 totalitarian regimes imposed upon free peoples by direct or indirect aggression undermine the foundations of international peace and hence the security of the united states
2355361 it must be the policy of the united states to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures
2355362 animated by a new fanatic faith antithetical to our own and seeks to impose its absolute authority over the rest of the world
2355363 to bludgeon the mass mind of top government so that not only could the president make a decision but that the decision could be carried out
2355364 the implacable purpose of the slave state is to eliminate the challenge of freedom
2355365 freedom for all the peoples and nations now under communist domination including the russian people
2355366 repudiate all commitments contained in secret understandings such as yalta which aid communist enslavement
2355367 w e shall again make liberty into a beacon light of hope that will penetrate the dark places it will mark the end of the negative futile and immoral policy of containment which abandons countless human beings to a despotism and godless terrorism
2355368 any gangsters rule is strengthened if he can get his picture taken along with the mayor the chief of police and the parson
2355369 i doubt if any united states senator or government official ever before in the history of our republic has been called upon to make a case for victory in a conflict where everything that the united states stands for today or ever stood for in the past is at stake
2355370 the concept of mutual assured destruction provides one of the few instances in which the obvious acronym for something yields at once the appropriate description for it that is a mutual assured destruction posture as a goal is almost literally mad mad
2355371 the world peace council a moscow directed movement which advocates the disarmament of the west as well as support for terrorist groups
2355372 weve fought fire with fire never thinking that fire is better quenched with water
2355373 the human race is very resilient depending upon certain assumptions some estimates predict that there would be ten million casualties on one side and one hundred million on another but that is not the whole of the population
2355374 im not saying we wouldnt get our hair mussed but i do say no more than ten to twenty million killed top depending on the breaks
2355375 that was the best statement i have ever heard from any president
2355376 wouldnt it be better to save lives than to avenge them
2355377 many people at the top of the soviet hierarchy were genuinely afraid of america and americans
2355378 many soviet officials feared us not only as adversaries but as potential aggressors who might hurl nuclear weapons at them in a first strike
2355379 reagan did not know enough about nuclear weapons systems to formulate a policy to accomplish his objectives he was susceptible to manipulation by advisers who shared his militant anti communism but not his distaste for nuclear deterrence and who wanted neither arms reduction nor arms control
2355380 im with the bush cheney team and im here to stop the count
2355381 he is the kind of man with whom i would want to stand at armageddon
2355382 when i was coming up it was a dangerous world and we knew exactly who the they were it was us versus them and it was clear who them was today were not so sure who they they are but we know theyre there
2355383 why not the alternative is to leave monsters on the loose raving and pillaging to their hearts content
2355384 this is a big shift to wrap ones mind around but we cannot cling to the old order like medieval scholars clinging to a ptolemaic system even after the copernican revolution we must realize that the strategic world we grew up in has been turned upside down
2355385 who is this guy i cant believe how naive he is
2355386 jacksonian realism is based on the very sharp distinction in popular feeling between the inside of the folk community and the dark world without jacksonian patriotism is an emotion like love of ones family not a doctrine
2355387 the civilian nuclear industry appears to be poised for worldwide expansions

2355400 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2355401 i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness
2355402 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices and i had hoped that it would never become public
2355403 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry

2355430 over half of the recorded aids cases in the palestinian territories have died and seven have reached an advanced stage and are receiving full anti retroviral medication which was introduced in february of this year by the pna
2355431 the palestinian ministry of health has assumed full responsibility for these cases at a cost of 2 000 dollars per person per month the pna also takes care of counselling and related medical follow ups as well as unrelated treatment including dental care and surgery
2355432 our five year project will involve researching high risk groups such as prostitutes and gay men whom we know very little about due to the taboo nature of these issues in our highly religious and conservative society
2355433 we plan to use a snowball effect of establishing where we believe these groups are operating and then studying their dynamics by approaching womens shelters womens jails and perhaps the police
2355434 apart from establishing contact with prostitutes and gay men two of the highest risk groups we are also trying to educate men about the necessity of using condoms
2355435 traditionally sexual reproductive health issues have targeted women as men in our patriarchal society have regarded this as primarily a womens issue
2355436 the palestinian national aids council held a world aids day conference in the west bank and gaza in december of 2006
2355437 a palestinian man who was suffering from aids introduced himself and explained his circumstances not only was the audience sympathetic and interested but afterwards a prominent muslim leader and a prominent christian leader hugged and kissed the young man it was very moving and this helped people to understand that aids sufferers were neither dangerous nor a threat to other people
2355438 the visitor to the colnaghi exhibition is apt to suffer from red spots in front of his eyes

2355440 interest in edward seago as an artist has been increasing and there has been a move to reassess him as an artist who never received the critical acclaim he deserved despite his popularity and commercial success during his lifetime his work has had a profound influence on many current artists hence the title of this exhibition the artists artist

2355495 patently protectionist an empirical analysis of patent cases at the itc
2355496 that the itc is protectionist is unfair to defendants and fosters inconsistency in us patent law
2355497 fails to find support for the first two contentions itc cases involve domestic defendants as often as they do foreigners and often in combination thus plaintiffs are using the itc to prosecute not only foreign companies but us companies as well when cases were adjudicated plaintiffs were more likely to win in the itc than in district court however when cases filed in both venues were compared the difference disappeared cutting against claims of an anti defendant bias the data provide some support for the third contention however

2355716 people spoke with great eloquence about the reasons for stopping the escalation of the war
2355717 being held in the el paso county jail near colorado springs colorado awaiting a military court martial for resisting the unjust and illegal war against and occupation of iraq robin will be court martialed for desertion with intent to remain away permanently article 85 of the uniform code of military justice in early september the maximum allowable penalty for a guilty verdict on this charge is three years confinement forfeiture of pay and a dishonorably discharge from the army in order to expedite robins trial it appears that his unit command the fourth brigade combat team fourth infantry division is option to not charge robin with speech related violations of military discipline opting to try and convict robin as fast as possible
2355718 robin long did what he did because of his conscience and because he believed that the war was wrong that he was simply running away or hiding out i think most americans now realize that the war in iraq is a complete mistake
2355719 the war resisters support campaign is calling on supporters across canada to urgently continue to put pressure on the minority conservative government to immediately cease deportation proceedings against other us war resisters and to respect the will of canadians and their elected representatives by implementing the motion adopted by parliament on june 3rd
2355720 if i tell the iraqi police or the sons of iraq they will tell the wrong people and i will be killed i dont trust them if i tell the americans theyll tell no one how they found about the grenades
2355721 when the sois sons of iraq stood up we were basically hiring terrorists
2355722 why dont you ask the iraqis to pay the entire costs of that program
2355723 the u s military was supposed to be out of the employment business by now when it introduced the sons of iraq initiative last year senior commanders expected the local security personnel to be hired gradually into the ranks of the iraqi army and police but iraqs shiite dominated central government has balked at the idea of bringing so many young sunni men including many onetime militants into the countrys fledging security forces less than 20 of the roughly 103 000 sons of iraq had been given government jobs as of early june that has left u s forces responsible for employing and paying the iraqis
2355724 the national front and other onetime insurgent groups will join a bitter struggle for power between established sunni politicians of the iraqi islamic party and upstart leaders of the sahwa or awakening council a u s backed tribal alliance whose popularity has grown following its success in combating the group al qaeda in iraq entering the elections is to change the current reality in our area the domination of the sunni spectrum by the iraqi islamic party said effan al issawi the top awakening commander in falluja they are unworthy of leading the sunnis
2355725 i believe i have something okay we continue to urge the council of representatives to seek a compromise that can be adopted promptly we regret that the iraqi parliament adjourned yesterday without finishing its work on a local elections law the parliamentarians have made great strides towards finishing the closing agreement on most of the more difficult issues we recognize that the election law brought to the floor important questions regarding the status of kirkuk the status of kirkuk is indeed a sensitive issue that needs to be addressed in a serious fashion but it is an issue that cannot be solved through the legislative mechanism of the eleciton law the election law should not be held hostage to that problem
2355726 my understanding is that theyre continuing i dont have anything particular to say about the process right now we havent discussed those publicly before im not going to here as we said well provide you with details when we get through with this
2355727 i would not be prepared to provide a timeline for that
2355728 shiite militia leader muqtada al sadr stepped back into iraqs political fray friday with an offer that if genuine washington would be hard pressed to refuse set a timetable for withdrawal of u s troops from iraq and the mahdi army will begin to disband the main reason for the armed resistance is the american miltiary presence said sadr emissary salah al ubaidi who spoke to reporters in najaf friday if the american military begins to withdrawal there will be no need for these armed groups
2355729 was one of the main reasons that violence in iraq has dropped to the lowest levels in four years for both civilians and trooops
2355730 i was pleasantly surprised when i learned that libertarian party presidential candidate bob barr would be testifying he didnt disappoint he made a great opening statement about preserving constitutional liberty through checks and balances and the separation of powers but the best part of his testimony was in the second round before questioning what we are facing now is a constitutional clock and it is countind own what remains of the constitution of this great land i might ask then to introduce for the record the disappearing bill of rights this is the bill of rights that we as members of the judiciary committee know he holds up a copy of the bill of rights as adopted in 1791 he flips it over to reveal a copy of the bill of rights that is largely redacted this is what it is fast becoming you know its a sad day when a former congressman has to submit the bill of rights for the record in a congressional hearing
2355731 seemed to be really trying to make case for their won partys reelection they failed as petulant and petty as the republicans were throughout the hearing representative lamar smith of texas the ranking republican hit the nail on the head it seems that we are hosting an anger management class this hearing will not cause us to impeach the president it will only serve to impeach congresss credibility the democrats have become a sorry excuse for an opposition party i dont think any of the many potentially deserving members of the bush administration will ever be impeached for the same reason that we didnt have impeachment hearings today or even months ago the democrats are just as corrupt and complicit spineless democrats are neocon appeasers and the blood is on their hands too
2355732 well wait a second who should be apologizing whos voted for this war who voted for the patriot act who supports all these appropriations who supports the fisa bill
2355733 you like to invoke the name ralph nader but you never invoke the name ross perot who won 19 of the vote and elected bill clinton president in 1992 with 43 or less of the vote clinton got less percentage of the vote than our current president did in 2000 but you never hear about
2355734 come on we can have a better country we can change this around
2355735 well if i were president the home morgate crisis wouldnt have happened and the oil prices wouldnt be what they are

2355739 i would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice
2355740 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself

2355757 and i entered a strange zone was sucked up into what felt like a void my senses materially unaltered felt different as if spirituality disconnected from that jubilant scene passing before our eyes babies families six foot smiling blank copy page of a common place book rod ent ertainments later this tome turned again after a close about turn upward one not dyad claspton who dyes the other world entered as void impressed force negative vivacity negativity certain hits where a concern this realms big slim if not the same

2355759 this was not the first time ronnie and i had entered a whites only place just the first time as
2355760 since my daughter was born with cerebral palsy over 10 years ago i began to notice how little recognition and inclusion there was in marketing outreach efforts
2355761 from my own observations and from the observations of others caring for family members with physical and or mental challenges it seemed that companies were only satisfied with adhering to the requirements of the american disabilities act which is necessary but the recognition of the communitys contributions and vitality faded into the background
2355762 incorporating people with disabilities in personal and professional activities still makes people uncomfortable such as still is the case with some ethnic minorities but the disability community can no longer be overlooked
2355763 the reality is that the disability community comprises every race and culture in existence which i would say justifies being recognized as multicultural in addition the community is the largest minority population in the nation with over 55 million people with an aggregate income of over 1 trillion
2355764 this does not include its supporting network such as immediate and extended family members as with the other diverse cultures the special needs community is also very conscious of which companies are reaching out to them with products services and marketing programs and those that are not
2355765 for example among the companies with which i work is a leading financial investment firm that recognizes the need to provide customized life planning services to families with special needs children or adults
2355766 these are parents or caregivers who are concerned with the challenges associated with ensuring life long financial stability for family members with disabilities also there are employment issues specific use of consumer goods and services and many more marketing opportunities for savvy companies to maximize
2355767 my job is to open the eyes of corporations that they can greatly enhance their bottom line by making them aware of the significance of the disability community and showing them how to be effective at reaching this significant consumer segment
2355768 and at the same time help fill the many voids for products services and recognition within this growing community
2355769 one almost never sees voluntary self restraint everybody operates at the extreme limit of those legal frames an oil company is legally blameless when it purchases an invention of a new type of energy in order to prevent its use a food product manufacturer is legally blameless when he poisons his produce to make it last longer after all people are free not to buy it i have spent all my life under a communist regime and i will tell you that a society without any objective legal scale is a terrible one indeed but a society with no other scale but the legal one is not quite worthy of man either

2355807 voter registration barriers challenged in new mexico at veterans affairs
2355808 senator mccains tax cuts would primarily benefit those with very high incomes almost all of whom would receive large tax cuts that would on average raise their after tax incomes by more than twice the average for all households

2355858 he was there a month ago in this community and was asked a question about this dhl issue and did not say one word about his role in this or the role of his campaign manager that is the furthest thing from straight talk that we can imagine
2355859 john mccain can become an emblem for people about what is wrong with washington he released an ad this week about how washington is broken and how he will strive to fix it he didnt mention that he has been enmeshed in a broken washington culture for 26 years or that his campaign is run by the most powerful now former lobbyist in washington

2355881 i am neither geek nor nerd i am not a hacker a phreaker a programmer or any variety of technoid dweeb
2355882 but you like to spend so much time by yourself
2355883 considering the attitude of the people particularly effluent class towards ownership and use of vehicles it is highly unlikely that provision of safe footpaths can stop this dependency but walking friendly routs along roads and streets can slow down the trend and allow health conscious residents to take a chance by foot
2355884 municipalities have the main responsibility for land use planning and for developing and managing the physical environment of urban areas but city and town development is a complicated process where a number of stakeholders often have contradictory interests the municipalities are dependent on close co operation with the private sector public and private developers and national authorities of various sectors in order to create a comprehensive approach co ordinate efforts and balance out different interests
2355885 it is a free for all society when one hits the road in any of the cities in the country in the absence of safe footpaths people driving in our crowded habitats should be more courteous towards those walking on roads otherwise women and senior citizens will always be afraid to come out of homes on foot

2355892 hegel remarks somewhere that all great world historic facts and personages appear so to speak twice he forgot to add the first time as tragedy the second time as farce
2355893 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
2355894 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
2355895 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
2355896 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
2355897 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
2355898 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
2355899 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
2355900 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
2355901 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
2355902 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
2355903 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
2355904 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

2355910 we dont just kick them scammers out after they tried to scam somebody we dont allow the scam artists to register and contact other singles in the first place
2355911 does this mean the credit crisis is over and that commodities will tank
2355912 there are 8 500 banks in the u s based on an independent analysis by chris whalen from institutional risk analytics they have identified 8 of all banks or around 700 banks as troubled this is quite a divergence from the fdic estimate should you believe a governmental agency that wants the public to remain in the dark to avoid bank runs or an independent analysis based upon balance sheet analysis the implications of 700 institutions failing are huge there is roughly 6 84 trillion in bank deposits it is almost beyond belief that 2 6 trillion of these deposits are uninsured there is only 274 billion of the 6 84 trillion as cash on hand at banks this means that 6 5 trillion has been loaned to consumers businesses developers etc the fdic has 53 billion to cover 6 84 trillion of deposits does that give you a warm feeling

2355917 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2355918 i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness
2355919 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices and i had hoped that it would never become public
2355920 with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly but that misconduct took place for a short period in 2006 it ended then
2355921 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2355922 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
2355923 if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help

2355941 brenden gaskins from the first day of camp on has done a real nice job and kurt is pushing him coming out of spring practice one of my biggest concerns was backup quarterback and i am not concerned at this point i like the way both guys have come back
2355942 most of the other positions i am comfortable with not only with the potential who might be there but the depth but i would say fullback is the spot if i would have to say remaining if there is a concern thats where i would put it
2355943 i just think they are coached very well and i think we have competition at both spots which is great
2355944 so you have brandon howard and g pittman at the field corner and then scotty johnson and brandon bradley at the boundary corner so if they want to hold their spots or compete for their spots they have to make plays they are doing a nice job
2355945 i think his ability to rush the passer is what precipitated the move back
2355946 he might be the second best pass rusher on our team after jan jorgensen
2355947 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2355948 we deplore the russian military action in georgia which is a violation of georgian sovereignty and territorial integrity
2355949 the deputy secretary said that we deplore todays russian attacks by strategic bombers and missiles which are threatening civilian lives
2355950 these attacks mark a dangerous and disproportionate escalation of tension
2355951 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2355952 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2355953 georgian military forces completely control all the territory of south ossetia
2355954 they have sent in their troops and weapons and they are bombing our towns
2355955 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located
2355956 we wont allow the death of our compatriots go unpunished
2355957 the cdc is committed to ensuring that its resources are going to the populations hardest hit by the epidemic
2355958 its often more politically viable to fund programs for women and children and youth
2355959 at a minimum we need to be matching percentages to where the epidemic is
2355960 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2355961 its impossible to count the ruined buildings now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2355962 russia is fighting a war with us in our own territory and we are in this situation of self defence against our neighbour
2355963 in accordance with the constitution and federal laws i as president of russia am obliged to protect lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located
2355964 we wont allow the death of our compatriots to go unpunished
2355965 i want to reiterate on his behalf that the united states supports georgias territorial integrity
2355966 we call for an immediate halt to the hostilities and strongly urge all parties involved to display restraint in words and deeds and to respect national boundaries
2355967 ambulances are not able to move to evacuate wounded people
2355968 we are hearing reports of residents hiding in their basements and of hospitals being overwhelmed with the number of wounded having to conduct surgeries in corridors
2355969 we are receiving reports that a policy of ethnic cleansing was being conducted in villages in south ossetia the number of refugees is climbing the panic is growing people are trying to save their lives
2355970 about 1 400 died we will check these figures but the order of the numbers is around this we have this on the basis of reports from relatives
2355971 he is in big danger of losing the cachet he built up for himself in being pro western and the restraint he has often shown in the face of provocation by russia
2355972 i am deeply concerned over the dramatic situation in georgia and i deplore the loss of human lives and the suffering inflicted on the civilian population
2355973 i think my attitudes were a lot like yours back when i was 19 or 20 one thing i learned is that while im completely entitled to my tastes my likes my dislikes its a mistake to think that everyone else shares them
2355974 when i was in high school i felt so disconnected from the music community at large growing up in a rural community that it was easy to believe that what i wrote online would never matter in the real world now as my professional career is beginning i bitterly regret the youthful stridency that permitted me to opine so freely and so publicly not infrequently about people who i now know have read this site
2355975 and surely struggle against him we must in every possible way who would annihilate knowledge and reason and mind and yet ventures to speak confidently about everything
2355976 when the power of love becomes stronger than the love of power we will have peace
2355977 more than any time in history mankind faces a crossroads
2355978 from the day we went to school we learned nothing on the contrary we were made obtuse we were wrapped in a fog of words and abstractions
2355979 ive always said that theres nothing an atheist cant do if hes really unsure whether he believes anything or not
2355980 you know the saying snitches get yo know i see you somewhere
2355981 the fact that you have an exemption in one part of the criminal code and then another part of the criminal code is interpreted as not protecting that same conduct raises an issue of due process of law
2355982 this exact set of circumstances has come up several times in other states defendants have had their convictions overturned or criminal cases against them have not been allowed to proceed
2355983 it shows the persistence of these healing practices and the laws inadequacy to remedy this particular issue
2355984 i do think there are more cases we dont know about
2355985 many times the lord has told me things that are going to happen many years down the road but this was the first time i had experienced this kind of preparation for that very day
2355986 i feel god saying it is time for believers to step forward in obedience and faith and signs will follow
2355987 both the mother and the father were praying to god
2355988 has not been sick at all over the last couple of days
2355989 it was extremely hard to get any information from the mother and the father about any medical problems madeline was experiencing
2355990 neumann preferred to say that she was in sleep mode
2355991 i asked kara if she loved jesus and she shook her head yes
2355992 we just thought it was a spiritual attack and we prayed for her
2355993 i said the lords going to heal her and we continued to pray
2355994 we need agreement in prayer over our youngest daughter who is very weak and pale at the moment with hardly any strength
2355995 we thank you father for giving dale and leilani the faith to hold fast to the confession of their hope that it waver not for it is your will father that kara was already healed i peter 2 24 we add faith to dales and leilanis and command kara to be healed we command that spirit of infirmity to loose kara now leave her body leave her home and go back from where it came and stay there
2355996 was a test of faith for the neumann family and asked the wormgoors to join them in praying for kara to get well
2355997 we believe that all parents should have a duty to get necessary medical care for their children regardless of their religious beliefs
2355998 lots of diabetes deaths lots of infectious diseases that are readily treated with antibiotics
2355999 almost half the states permitted spiritual care in some form for the healthcare of children
2356000 this means religious accommodations did not originate with the federal government the federal government simply responded to what state governments were already doing
2356001 solely because he or she provides a child with treatment by spiritual means through prayer alone for healing in accordance with the religious method for healing in lieu of medical or surgical treatment
2356002 if there is some ambiguity in the law regarding the way its to be construed or if there are two offenses that fully describe the conduct involved then the defendant is entitled to get the benefit of the more lenient application of the law
2356003 at some point you may see that being argued here
2356004 the law is a green light for parents to think they dont have any responsibility to society regarding how they treat their children the state should be stepping in here to do everything it can to discourage faith healing in place of medical care
2356005 we deplore the abuse and neglect of children under any circumstances
2356006 dont claim that all cases of religious objections to medical care should be free from legal limitations
2356007 the christian science church has documented 125 years of healings that have occurred through prayer
2356008 spiritual healing through prayer definitely has a place in society
2356009 ketoacidosis is something that kills children in hospitals every day
2356010 but we never second guess the doctors because we assume that they do their best but the parents of children who died of these illnesses never get the benefit of the same assumption what gets lost is what they were seeing what they were experiencing no one seems to want to find out about the reasonableness of their conduct
2356011 the law is supposed to reflect public consensus most people do not want this kind of behavior exempted from prosecution
2356012 what everyone wants to have happen is that children will be protected that children will be safer and that children wont suffer
2356013 i dont think that prosecuting parents after the child has died really solves that
2356014 no one who is involved in these cases likes them
2356015 no one walks away from them feeling satisfied no amount of prosecuting the parents is going to bring the child back to life
2356016 we anoint people for healing ive seen people get healed and ive seen people who havent healed
2356017 god is the creator of the doctor who has skill and those who make medicine to heal
2356018 is as much about wholeness as about a disease being cured
2356019 theres an old saying in politics that elections are won or lost one vote at a time
2356020 public embarrassment for team franken only one person attends campaign event
2356021 he said he did not know how much the program would cost or how he would pay for it
2356022 my mom and my aunt eventually got me to talk with my county vso he got me registered with the va and since then i havent had a problem ive gotten a lot of help and every question ive gotten answered
2356023 when accessorizing take off the last thing you put on

2356025 attendees must be able to use a mouse create a new folder and have a basic understanding of a computer
2356026 there was a rich man whose manager was accused of wasting his possessions 2so he called him in and asked him what is this i hear about you give an account of your management because you cannot be manager any longer
2356027 the manager told him take your bill sit down quickly and make it four hundred
2356028 he told him take your bill and make it eight hundred
2356029 a man with 10 wives would collapse and die but my own power is given by allah that is why i have been able to control 86 of them
2356030 i dont go looking for them they come to me i will consider the fact that god has asked me to do it and i will just marry them
2356031 i said i couldnt marry an older man but he said it was directly an order from god
2356032 i am now the happiest woman on earth when you marry a man with 86 wives you know he knows how to look after them

2356039 over the past two hours russian aviation has carried out flights on economic and civilian infrastructure targets
2356040 there has been an attack on the port of poti and on a railway junction and aerodrome in senaki
2356041 significantly increased its military presence on the border with abkhazia over the past 24 hours
2356042 the united states calls for an immediate ceasefire to the armed conflict in georgias region of south ossetia
2356043 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2356044 we underscore the international communitys support for georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders as articulated in numerous un security council resolutions
2356045 its a tactic of an adversarial approach towards the citizens you are representing it certainly doesnt show good faith i think most voters would be shocked that our own elected officials these are people that serve at the pleasure of the citizens for the citizens are conducting themselves in a way that is in essence spying on representatives of the community
2356046 i just wanted to protect myself the county the sheriff and other elected officials from anything that might be irregular
2356047 my only instruction was to video tape the meeting in case something got out of hand
2356048 clear that brock went to great lengths to cover up
2356049 people are human and they make mistakes i feel bad for his family and i feel bad for him im sure this is one of those times when being human catches up with you
2356050 anybody looking at this its going to be difficult for john in the future politically
2356051 what we need is a critique of visual culture that is alert to the power of images for good and evil and that is capable of discriminating the variety and historical specificity of their uses
2356052 i often say that when i am making a portrait im not
2356053 portraiture in the past has been regarded as a documentation of a person but for me it is a documentation of the encounter between myself and the subject it is not meant to reveal them nor is it meant to subject them to an x ray it is a departure from that i am more interested in the alchemical reaction that occurs when elements are brought together in a space not so much a collaboration between photographer and subject more a scientific experiment the studio becomes a lab
2356054 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
2356055 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
2356056 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters know is who uses that language for what purpose
2356057 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
2356058 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
2356059 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
2356060 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
2356061 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
2356062 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
2356063 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
2356064 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
2356065 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
2356066 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
2356067 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
2356068 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
2356069 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
2356070 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
2356071 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
2356072 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
2356073 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
2356074 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
2356075 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
2356076 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
2356077 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
2356078 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
2356079 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
2356080 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
2356081 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
2356082 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
2356083 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
2356084 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
2356085 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
2356086 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make
2356087 rudy is a family pet he doesnt go anywhere but hes part of the family

2356091 how many novels do we really need each year to support a brand
2356092 over the past twenty years or so it has been argued that over one hundred billion us dollars has been expended by the saudi government in propagating their version of islam across the world
2356093 there are no jokes in islam there is no humour in islam there is no fun in islam
2356094 we had a hard fought primary campaign and it was exciting it was a bit like the preverbal rollercoaster but we are now unified and ready to go forward together and it is imperative that each and every one of us think about how we are going to help in this election i am proud to be standing with and working for barack obama
2356095 i hope those of you who supported me will work as hard and fight as hard for senator obama as you did for me
2356096 i have a great deal of respect for senator mccain and for his heroic service to our nation but john mccain and his fellow republicans offer a very different vision for america and its a vision that were familiar with the same policies and politics that we have had to endure for eight years under president bush
2356097 alcohol drugs and partying are not the answer it just makes things worse
2356098 for gallantry in action against a determined enemy sgt hernandez exemplary bravery under fire and a complete disregard for his own safety enabled him to single handedly pull two members of the iraqi national police force to safety despite having already been severely wounded himself the gallant actions of sgt hernandez are in the finest traditions of military heroism
2356099 soldiers should talk about experiences they encountered down range its about making themselves better in their head and in their heart and if they dont feel comfortable talking to people who have not experienced combat issues they can look me up ill be more than happy to talk to them
2356100 ive been in the army a while and hernandez is one of the top team leaders ive ever had
2356101 when i came back i wanted to talk about everything that happened and it helped me because after a while i was happy
2356102 if i had waited i probably would have developed ptsd
2356103 the guys ask if i sit in my front porch and predict what the weather will be like today is your leg aching they ask
2356104 they give me a hard time and i love it
2356105 some dont even have a mom and dad who can give them a hug
2356106 its pretty hard on them and pretty hard on us to see that im just glad my son doesnt have to go through that thats why i want to go back to help the iraqi people acquire the same rights we have in the u s
2356107 people who want to pull out from iraq should walk a mile in my shoes and see the things i saw
2356108 i am neither geek nor nerd i am not a hacker a phreaker a programmer or any variety of technoid dweeb
2356109 if you have it between your arms you wont knock it over i have never spilled a drink on the table

2356116 african americans continue to suffer from the consequences of slavery and jim crow long after both systems were formally abolished through enormous damage and loss both tangible and intangible including the loss of human dignity and liberty the frustration of careers and professional lives and the long term loss of income and opportunity
2356117 church officials vetted li by talking to people listed on his application as personal references
2356118 yesterday edmonton radio station 630 ched reported that mclean had told an asian man who was hitting on a female co worker of his on the bus to lay off
2356119 a chinese muslim li expressed to investigators that his actions were motivated by the koran
2356120 he was a very nice polite guy we wouldve had no reason to let him go before all this happened
2356121 very unfriendly he would never keep the elevator open the striking characteristic for this guy is that he is really anti social
2356122 he was kind of a lost soul it was as if he was always looking for something a member of a winnipeg family which befriended li even having him over for christmas dinner two years ago told the free press they say li was clearly battling mental illness but refused repeated offers to see a doctor and get help i think in their culture the issue of mental illness is kind of frowned upon the woman said and canada encourages immigrants to cherry pick the perks while clinging to the old ways they were so desperate to escape she works in the mental health field and said it was obvious li was struggling he was definitely schizophrenic probably paranoid schizophrenic she said he needed help but he just wouldnt get it there was the constant paranoia a feeling that he was always being watched and that others might be out to get him there were his bizarre rambling stories that seemed to come out of nowhere and there were the unannounced bus trips that would catch his wife by surprise such as the time he hopped on a greyhound headed to the pas later explaining that he wanted to look at some land he was thinking about buying i dont think he actually had any money this was probably just a symptom of his disease the woman said she recalls an unusual conversation with li shortly after he got a red light ticket in winnipeg he started talking about how they were after me there was nothing there the woman said

2356128 i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness
2356129 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2356130 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
2356131 im the only one with a mainstream presence jennas never been on the cover of fhm theres a lot more things ive done than jenna i wouldnt say she has a mainstream presence i would say that she is the number one face
2356132 i tell you the truth whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven
2356133 there are no jokes in islam there is no humour in islam there is no fun in islam

2356144 i never dreamed that i would ever see my website on the second page of a google search my website now reaches 300 service which i ever subscribe excellent client support work is carried out precisely and on time thank you
2356145 the way we developed the performance capture workflow on avatar is we have our virtual camera which allows me to in real time hold a camera its really a monitor in my hands and point it at the actors and see them as their cg characters
2356146 its this amazing ability to quickly conjure scenes and images and great fantasyscapes that is very visual when you are doing performance capture creatively its very daunting its very hard to imagine what it will look like but if you can see it if you can have a virtual image of what is it going to be like then you are there
2356147 we turned the set on the soundstage into a capture volume and turned the physical camera into a capture virtual camera so we were able to integrate cg characters and environments into our live action
2356148 we have people in flying vehicles and i can see what is outside the window fed in in real time
2356149 are we looking at a situation maybe 10 15 years out where most laptops are sold with 3d stereoscopic screens most monitors are stereo compatible most dvd players can run stereo content i can see this becoming much more pervasive that we are thinking now
2356150 i thought why me i didnt know how to handle it i didnt know anyone with diabetes there was no familiar face in music or sports that i could connect with but i started to see it as an opportunity to be an inspiration to a generation that doesnt openly talk about having diabetes and not feeling embarrassed by the disease
2356151 i remember when i was first diagnosed i was like i can do this and then sometimes it became alright i need somebodys help so id say can you do my needle for me today its ok to rely on other people and just be positive and keep going the biggest challenge is managing it before i go on stage and making sure i keep a watch on my blood sugar throughout the day its always very important there are times when you cant really help what happens to the sugar because part of it is kind of unpredictable but to be able to live my dream by being in a band shows that anything is possible even if you have diabetes
2356152 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public when a supermarket tabloid told a version of the story i used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it but being 99 honest is no longer enough
2356153 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices and i had hoped that it would never become public with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly but that misconduct took place for a short period in 2006 it ended then i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established i only know that the apparent father has said publicly that he is the father of the baby i also have not been engaged in any activity of any description that requested agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2356154 if you want to succeed in your life remember this phrase the past does not equal the future because you failed yesterday or all day today or a moment ago or for the last six months the last 16 years or the last fifty years of life doesnt mean anything all that matters is what are you going to do right now
2356155 im satisfied this was a deliberate attempt by mr mellin to kill himself

2356164 do you want to stay in the eu if so sign lisbon if not get out
2356165 the recent poll showing that 71 of irish people are opposed to a second referendum on the lisbon treaty has not had much impact in european capitals since the wording of the question indicated that the vote would be on the same text there is no question of that either the irish will be asked to adopt the lisbon treaty with ad hoc declarations responding to their concerns like in 2002 for nice or they will be asked if they want to continue to be part of a union that is governed by the lisbon treaty this second possibility would clarify things either you stay or you go but you do not block europe as a whole
2356166 here is why the lisbon treaty referendum was lost and if the government does not address this the next one will likely be lost as well people are worried about the loss of sovereignty and national identity the european court of justice an institution of the eu will gain immeasurably more power over irish law if the lisbon treaty and the accompanying charter of fundamental rights is ever passed we have to wake up to the fact that the more power we cede to judges lawyers and other experts whether they are based in ireland or overseas the less democratic we become the heart of democracy in any country has to be the national legislature with its elected representatives not the courts and the law library
2356167 wont deliver real cuts as its own business case shows
2356168 the french presidents language betrays temerity in spite of all its manifest strengths economic technological cultural political france it seems cannot stand on its own feet europes leaders must protect the continent from the ravages of globalisation the collapse of doha however speaks to the failure of both sides to own up to the world as it is on the side of the rich countries particularly the us but no less many european nations there is a refusal to acknowledge that globalisation no longer belongs to the west
2356169 proposed changes could greatly increase the cost of capital across europe with detrimental effects far beyond the financial services industry
2356170 the message were trying to get across is that its a very difficult environment for financial services what we dont need is regulation that will exacerbate the downturn
2356171 with a less well disposed russia once again prowling around the neighbourhood the need for a coherent organised collective european defence that is neither reliant on nor subordinate to washington could become painfully obvious

2356185 it turns out buying mortgages with nothing but a superficial glance at the paperwork something fannie and freddie excelled at during the housing boom just isnt good business although the 2 firms only lightly dabbled in subprime loans originators easily duped their automated risk engines into buying fraudulent or otherwise shoddy loans
2356186 its no longer a matter of if they collapse but when

2356195 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices
2356196 and i had hoped that it would never become public
2356197 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2356198 i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
2356199 if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself
2356200 strange as it may seem it is still true that those who fail to understand other churches than their own are not the people who care intensely about theology but the theological dilettantes eclectics and historians of all sorts while those very men who have found themselves forced to confront a clear thoroughgoing logical sic et non find themselves allied to each other inspite of all contradictions by an underlying fellowship and understanding even in the cause which they handle so differently and approach from such painfully different angles but the cause it may be is nothing less than jesus christ and the unity of the church
2356201 only in christ are all things in communion he is the point of convergence of all hearts and beings and therefore the bridge and the shortest way from each to each
2356202 the doctrine of justification by faith is in fact the great ecumenical doctrine

2356234 i believe that the edwards are both sincere in their stated positions about poverty health care and other issues
2356235 kerry was stunned not moved because as he told me later edwards had recounted the same exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else kerry said he found it chilling
2356236 oh of course i knew it was all so obvious
2356237 watch msnbc were too damned smart and professional to get stupid news right

2356240 the money was purely and simply to get them out of north carolina and to get them into a stable place
2356241 they were unable to afford a second home it was to give them the ability to live somewhere where they wouldnt be harassed

2356250 president musharraf have been and goes on to be a strong voice against extremism we value our partnership with the government of islamic republic of pakistan under the leading of president musharraf
2356251 unfortunately the recent police force actions against protestors suppression of the media and the apprehensions of political and human rights leadership run directly counter to the reforms that have got been undertaken in recent years
2356252 emergency regulation is not compatible with free fair and credible elections which necessitate the active engagement of political parties civil society and the media the people of islamic republic of pakistan rate an chance to choose their leadership free from the limitations that be under a state of emergency
2356253 we welcome his committedness to retire from his regular army station before commencing his 2nd presidential term and we urge on him to do so as soon as possible

2356258 t o permit this execution to proceed forthwith places the united states irremediably in violation of international law and breaks our treaty promises in my view we should seek the views of the solicitor general which may well clarify these matters and we should grant a stay of sufficient length for careful consideration of those views along with the other briefs and materials filed in this suit a sufficient number of justices having voted to secure those views four it is particularly disappointing that no member of the majority has proved willing to provide a courtesy vote for a stay so that we can consider the solicitor generals view once received
2356259 i believe we should request the views of the solicitor general who argued on behalf of the executive branch in earlier proceedings in the suit before allowing texas to proceed with the execution balancing the honor of the nation against the modest burden of a short delay convinces me that the application for a stay should be granted
2356260 i would therefore enter the requested stay of execution for as long as the remainder of the 2007 term to allow for a current statement of the views of the solicitor general and for any congressional action that could affect the disposition of petitioners filings
2356261 america is uh is no longer uh what it could be what it once was and i say to myself i dont want that future for my children
2356262 kenjis been a starter throughout his career and hes not that right now
2356263 there are no words to soften that and hes handled it well
2356264 a lot of other people know each other a lot better than i do
2356265 i dont think many people expected the u s trials to be so darn fast
2356266 i always had in mind that if i made the relay it would be a good swim and if i made an individual event it would be a great swim
2356267 around sophomore year of high school was when i really got serious about training
2356268 i thought to myself as long as im in the pool i might as well be working hard because if not im just going to be wasting my time
2356269 i tried to get these swimmers to dream big and attempt to be great
2356270 at first just down in my heart i said oh my gosh whats going on
2356271 he was doing great in ncaas good in his academics and now he was talking about not going to school and just swimming none of my kids did that
2356272 we realized this was a once in a lifetime opportunity and whatever he wanted to do wed support it
2356273 we knew if we didnt let him go wed have regrets later on
2356274 this is totally untrue we did not send any apology
2356275 i have had a lotta cream puffs in my life and i cant really say im that huge of a fan
2356276 i think it stands up best and tastes best after 4 5 days in the fridge
2356277 the ground truth is just that the sales numbers on the pc are not what they used to be and are not what they are on the consoles
2356278 i put in a tremendous amount of work meeting all these requirements when i could have put that work into the actual game and made it even a little more polished little bit better
2356279 for example the way in which you can launch braid and be directly in the game that is technically illegal if you go by the book but they saw what i was trying to do and went with it
2356280 this is totally untrue we did not send any apology
2356281 i realized the pros dont hit it any further than i do
2356282 when i hit my driver like i did today this is an easy sport
2356283 i dont think its going to be won by 1 under par
2356284 i just need to make sure that i stay around where i am and maybe a little closer to par thats going to have a chance on sunday
2356285 its the kind of round ive been looking for to get myself back on the leaderboard and feeling the good vibes
2356286 when i got here on tuesday i called home and i said this is the hardest golf course ive ever played
2356287 if i were to play here every day i dont know if i would enjoy it its a very difficult golf course
2356288 im not that aggressive if im not hitting my driver good
2356289 if im hitting bad shots with it you dont hit it as much you hit it right where youve looked whale away
2356290 if youre hitting where youre aiming it every time youre hitting good
2356291 my senior year of high school i went out and watched tiger
2356292 a lot of the players they said hit the ball really long
2356293 its just a matter of taking care of the opportunities that im given theres weeks where you can play your best and not win and theres weeks where you can kind of stumble your way in and win
2356294 unfortunately things didnt happen for me on the back nine its very difficult and this is a major
2356295 theres a lot of golf left out here and the golf course is very difficult
2356296 so i think that it wont be overly difficult if you play well to make up some ground
2356297 we dont know why it changed but its likely tied to the fact that casa are yet to finish their investigation into maintenance procedures
2356298 we explored options for checks on two 737 400 aircraft once space became available at our tullamarine facility the decision was taken to have the work done there
2356299 its too early to say whether the aircrafts grounding in melbourne was related to the maintenance check in malaysia or not
2356300 all the highlights were rectified to the satisfaction of the qantas team before aircraft delivery to australia
2356301 with regards to the string of faults that were reported in the media malaysia airlines investigated and established that these were unsubstantiated
2356302 this is based on the fact that all these aspects were originally checked and found to be free from defect during the maintenance check and test flight with the concurrence from the qantas team
2356303 the 12 hottest years in history have all been in the last 13 years
2356304 its not a question of debate what about the medieval warming period the historical record shows they were growing wine in england for goodness sake come on it is not disputed by anyone that the vikings arrived in greenland in ad900 and it was warmer than greenland is now what penny wong is doing is being selective and saying that is a long time ago
2356305 land based temperature readings are corrupted by the urban heat island effect
2356306 urban areas encroaching on thermometer stations warm the micro climate around the thermometer due to vegetation changes concrete cars and houses
2356307 that doesnt mean you give up on the science and that you cant draw valid conclusions about the nature of earths temperature change
2356308 create a brouhaha and muddy the waters in the climate change story
2356309 all official measures of global temperature show that it peaked in 1998 and has been declining since at least 2002
2356310 and this is in the face of an almost 5 per cent increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide since 1998 spot the problem
2356311 the changes in temperature over the past 10 years have basically plateaued
2356312 but scientists did not anticipate a gradual year by year warming in temperature what matters is the long term trend this outcome does not change any of the science but it does change the spin climate deniers can put on it
2356313 in the last 10 years we have seen an increase in carbon dioxide levels yet temperatures are coming down that if anyone looks at the actual data is not disputable carbon dioxide is not driving temperatures because there are other important climatic factors at play
2356314 from a climate standpoint it is far too short a period to have any significance
2356315 what we are seeing now is consistent with our understanding of variability between decades if we hung about for another 30 years and it kept going down then you might start to think there is something we dont understand but the evidence at this point suggests this is not something we should hang around and wait for
2356316 in the last 10 years there has been a catastrophic and massive arctic sea ice retreat weve seen glacial retreat permafrost thaw and ocean thermal expansion so temperature is not the whole story
2356317 it is widely alleged that the science of global warming is settled
2356318 this implies that all the major scientific aspects of climate change are well understood and uncontroversial the allegation is profoundly untrue even the most widely held opinions should never be regarded as an ultimate truth
2356319 climate change is a robust area of science and there is plenty that is still being debated and new discoveries are still being made
2356320 it is a topic that will keep attracting different opinions from enthusiasts and from bloggers they are a minority but they are proving to be a very vocal group
2356321 it is a surprising result in a globalising world with increasingly mobile capital flows for a small open economy to have the highest weight given to the taxation of capital income
2356322 i dont necessarily find thateverything in this paper gels with everything that i have said on tax in the past and that is as it should be
2356323 but you will hurt everyone who has put savings into superannuation and all those small businesses that are accumulating franking credits
2356324 the alternative for the government is do the unpopular thing of shift the tax burden to the community and lower the tax rate on the corporate sector
2356325 the productivity commissioner appears not to understand that these reviews are not reviews of tariffs but are in fact much broader than that
2356326 as illustrated by the latest reviews of auto and tcf textile clothing and footwear ongoing pressures from globalisation and emerging exporters exacerbated by exchange rate appreciation caused by the mining boom have been prompting calls for new measures to provide relief against imports or other assistance
2356327 effectively set the course for industry policy and its contribution to australias economic future
2356328 listens closely to the productivity commissions views but at the end of the day we will take our decisions in the national interest
2356329 want to be the prime minister of a country that doesnt make things any more
2356330 to the best of your understanding and in your own words please explain what evolution means
2356331 if you accept the theory of evolution please explain in your own words why if you do not accept the theory of evolution please explain in your own words why not
2356332 i have a ba in english lit from western illinois university everybody go ooooo
2356333 i have faith that my wife is not sleeping with the mailman

2356336 giraffe with long neck can reach food better so it live and have babies who then also have long necks short neck giraffes starve and die and no have babies
2356337 evolution is the means by which life solves the riddle of staying alive
2356338 evolution means that something reproduces itself perhaps with a slight variation if the variation is beneficial then the offspring will thrive and spread that same variation to their own offspring
2356339 i dont want to know what you believe i want to know what you think
2356340 not only did god do it but it was my god that was responsible
2356341 surprised to see the media come within 10 feet of touching is that elizabeth learned the cancer had returned after john cracked her rib during sex
2356342 not me she must have been sleeping around with some other dude
2356343 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2356344 maybe these supposed errors and contradictions need to be interpreted in a different way so that i can once again see clearly the truth of scripture
2356345 there are three that bear witness the spirit the water and the blood and these three are one
2356346 the formal doctrine of the trinity as it was defined by the great church councils of the fourth and fifth centuries is not to be found in the new testament
2356347 the son of god became man that we might become god
2356348 of pertaining to believing in or belonging to a religion based on the teachings of jesus christ
2356349 there is no regularly constituted church of christ on earth nor any person qualified to administer any church ordinances nor can there be until new apostles are sent by the great head of the church for whose coming i am seeking
2356350 nor can a christian believer be forced beyond sacred scriptures unless some new and proved revelation should be added for we are forbidden by divine law to believe except what is proved either through the divine scriptures or through manifest revelation
2356351 i have sought nothing beyond reforming the church in conformity with the holy scriptures the spiritual powers have been not only corrupted by sin but absolutely destroyed so that there is now nothing in them but a depraved reason and a will that is the enemy and opponent of god i simply say that christianity has ceased to exist among those who should have preserved it
2356352 now back the hell up or ill light you up like a christmas tree
2356353 you are the rock on which i shall build my church
2356354 a long march to a night that might be most momentous
2356355 there are two walls in china the wall that surrounds china and the wall that surrounds the ruling class
2356356 the chinese are reaching their hands out to the world
2356357 please do not write beijing is a city of stark contrasts
2356358 the elephant in the room is that china has yet to make the transition to a sustainable democratic system this is the 800lb gorilla that threatens to throw a monkey wrench into the chinese system the chinese leadership is still capable of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory
2356359 weve chased down the cheating spouse weve tried to get the telling pictures weve reported the news but weve never created the lover

2356364 the immediate restoration of the status quo before violence erupted and cessation of hostilities
2356365 this raises serious concerns about the commitment of russia to respect georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity as well as questions about ultimate russian intentions and objectives
2356366 there are reports about ethnic cleansing in villages of south ossetia the population is panicking and the number of refugees is increasing a humanitarian catastrophe is in the offing and here
2356367 it is the russian federation who really was supporting and is supporting militarily the regime in tskhinvali and sukhumi who are the perpetrators of the ethnic cleansing
2356368 now in the business of telling other countries not to invade their enemies
2356369 otherwise i suspect you are the type of liberal that begins history anew every morning
2356370 all those things were defended in the name of tradition and religion and you know it
2356371 all those things were defended in the name of tradition and religion and you know it
2356372 who cares im not addressing your religion im addressing social conservatism
2356373 seth so youd just let hitler stalin mao etc take over the world
2356374 you acknowledged all the evils i listed were supported by socons i am attacking soconism thanks for the admission by the way
2356375 yes socons were wrong but it wasnt my sect that time
2356376 my feelings as a christian points me to my lord and savior as a fighter it points me to the man who once in loneliness surrounded only by a few followers recognized these jews for what they were and summoned men to fight against them and who gods truth was greatest not as a sufferer but as a fighter how terrific was his fight for the world against the jewish poison
2356377 an apology to the innocent would be nice from one of you
2356378 also nice would be some explanation for why soconism has been wrong in every major battle it has ever fought until modern times in your view what changed
2356379 social conservatism is the political philosophy which seeks to enforce the traditional social order traditional social mores and behavior
2356380 i am not for or against anything merely because its tradition
2356381 social conservatism is the political philosophy which seeks to enforce the traditional social order traditional social mores and behavior
2356382 the only thing we know for a fact is that the rcc assisted the nazis in the extermination of the jewish citizens of the occupied nations
2356383 concentration camps due not flow from reason thats simply ridiculous the fact that some tyrants used reason to defend them means as much as that some have used religion to defend evil
2356384 leaders of the church once taught that slavery was acceptable under a wide range of situations
2356385 the church once taught that parents must not give their children inoculations against disease because it would thwart gods will god was seen as expecting a certain percentage of children to die inoculations would have prevented those deaths
2356386 the church placed under house arrest or burned alive a number of scientists and philosophers such as galileo and bruno
2356387 the trial of archbishop stepinac was a purely political one with the outcome determined in advance the trial and sentence of this croatian prelate are in contradiction with the yugoslavias pledge that it will respect human rights and the fundamental liberties of all without reference to race sex language and creed archbishop stepinac was sentenced and will be incarcerated as part of the campaign against his church guilty only of being the enemy of communism
2356388 he is hailed as a hero by catholics for his resistance to communism and his refusal to separate the croatian church from the vatican but many serbians and jews accuse him of sympathizing with the nazis while serving as zagrebs archbishop in 1941 stepinac supported croatias german backed fascist puppet government led by ante pavelic by 1942 however stepinac denounced the regimes genocidal policies which led to the extermination of thousands of serbians jews gypsies and croatian opponents
2356389 my friends and i helped to murder jews for 3 years but i am a good man because i denounced my friends for killing jews
2356390 in 1941 when yugoslavia fell before the attack of nazi germany croatia declared itself an independent state in reality it became a puppet ally of germany under the fascist usta a regime of ante paveli stepinac a dedicated croatian patriot accepted the paveli government as the legitimate representative of croatian aspirations to political self determination to the very last days of world war ii he publicly exhorted his clergy as well as the croatian masses to support and defend the usta a state he himself accepted the post of supreme apostolic vicar general of the croatian army and became a member of the ruling council of state his other actions and attitudes are in dispute his defenders insist that unlike other prominent croatian catholic churchmen and at great personal risk to himself stepinac denounced the barbarous nazi racial theories and practices adopted by the usta i and that he conducted extensive relief work among christian and jewish war refugees even hiding them in episcopal buildings they also deny that he condoned the forced conversions of orthodox christians to catholicism or the notorious massacres of many thousands of serbs jews slovenes and anti fascist croats
2356391 in fact there is no record of stepinac protesting against usta a methods before may 1942 by which time and by the most conservative estimates hundreds of thousands of serbs had been killed expelled or converted to catholicism
2356392 lower prices at the pump by increasing offshore drilling here at home
2356393 we played against one of the best teams in the world
2356394 as a team its good to measure yourself against the best in the world
2356395 without being cliche our backs are against the wall anything less than three points is going to be a disappointment and just make it tougher on ourselves in the future
2356396 certainly losing josh wolff the day before a game is an adjustment but every team has to deal with that
2356397 i thought we played a lackadaisical not very sharp first half i thought d c was by far the better team the first 45 minutes so i was extremely disappointed in the first 45 minutes of play second half i thought we came out very strong i dont know what the stats are but we for sure had a hell of a lot more shots than them in the second half
2356398 we didnt play with a lot of energy like i expected we make one mistake and they scored a goal in the second half we were better and we had a little more energy we were pushing forward
2356399 i dont think i saw too many chances except for the goal
2356400 the ball was bouncing around and they happened to get there first and got a shot off it was one of those unlucky things

2356410 youre religious how wonderful what a nice tradition what a nice moral guide and inspiration for wonderful art and music im dont happen to believe in that myself but how wonderful for you that you do
2356411 being nice only does not get you acceptance neither being angry only actually the lessons learned are that a diversity of approaches a nice one a less nice one and an angry one is what gets you acceptance and full acceptance is not yet achieved stimulating diversity of approaches is the real key to success
2356412 i disagree with nisbet but im not seeing how its blaming a victim
2356413 i dont believe thats true for people like donahue only good atheist is the non existent kind were immoral unethical followers of satan who are going straight to hell as soon as we die heres george h w bush on the subject of atheists
2356414 i disagree with nisbet but im not seeing how its blaming a victim
2356415 nisbet with christians reminds me of women like michelle malkin and serena joy for fictional versions who spend all of their time putting down other women to try and get into the boys club you want to smack them and say honey no matter how much you play nice and agree that all those other people in your group are bad but youre different and youre the good one it wont work they will throw you out of the clubhouse the second they get bored with you and feel like it nisbet the christians dont like you they might enjoy picking on pz more but just because theyre ignoring you doesnt mean the think youre better trust me they think a friendly atheist is going to hell and is just as much a threat to the fabric of society as an outspoken brash atheist
2356416 first i must confess that over the past few years i have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate
2356417 i agree with you in the goal you seek but i cannot agree with your methods of direct action
2356418 the whole history of the progress of human liberty shows that all concessions yet made to her august claims have been born of earnest struggle the conflict has been exciting agitating all absorbing and for the time being putting all other tumults to silence it must do this or it does nothing if there is no struggle there is no progress those who profess to favor freedom and yet depreciate agitation are men who want crops without plowing up the ground they want rain without thunder and lightning they want the ocean without the awful roar of its many waters
2356419 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
2356420 it takes more faith to be an evil utionist than to believe in god
2356421 i do want to go on record as finding your statement that christians trying to put their creed into public schools should go to prison to smack of troubling authoritarianism
2356422 see this is why religious moderation is dangerous because you shelter people like that
2356423 also atheists tend to point at that type of fundamentalist whacko and say
2356424 i may not agree with what you say but i will defend to the death your right to say it

2356433 we havent been at full strength since 2004 and were out to prove something
2356434 gail and dawn have been out recruiting and mike is looking ragged
2356435 for me i have the energy that i have to pass on at times theyve struggled with the schedules that theyve been on for more than just the wnba season
2356436 but i wanted to completely support her decision it became very apparent to me early in our conversation that she was ready to move on at that point there was no point in me trying to convince her to stay
2356437 weve already watched video of when we were at our worst as a team defensively and when we were at our best because i think its going to come down to defense she talked to the team about the work ethic were going to have shes been working nonstop but shes very aware that the players are a little fatigued mentally and physically having coached in the wnba so long
2356438 its such a fabulous once in a lifetime experience for me theres nothing like it

2356461 what are losses going to be where is credit going to go where are home prices going to bottom how long is that going to last whats the overall impact of the macroeconomy what is funding liquidity in the capital markets all of these scenarios that everybody has are highly highly sensitive to the variables and the assumptions that you make and none in my view are conclusory enough to have full visibility into where they wind up in 09

2356521 today when more children are overweight compared with previous generations it can be harder for parents to objectively identify if their child is overweight
2356522 research shows that most parents of overweight or obese children think that their child is a healthy weight some research showed that only 10 of parents with overweight or obese children described their child as overweight
2356523 preliminary findings of the survey suggest that many people who would be defined clinically as obese find the use of the term obese highly offensive and would stop listening to further advice
2356524 to shrink from using the word obesity is really ducking an issue
2356525 it does not have to be used in a judgmental or insulting way if a child is obese then the parents should know that its obese we must make parents know that the lifestyle of the family needs to be modified
2356526 risks and benefits of bmi reporting in the school setting
2356527 our feeling is that the information should be given to parents if there is a serious health concern much like any other health concern a child might have
2356528 this information should not be included on a report card or such medical information should be kept separate
2356529 we all need to come out mentally strong and focused because we have to win we feel every game in an olympic is a must win but this one more than ever

2356558 the overall emission of the pollutants in beijing has remarkably decreased
2356559 actually in the summer in beijing we have sunny days cloudy days and hazy days as well in beijing
2356560 since people are paying very much attention on the air quality you must also pay attention on pollutions emission reduction ever since july we adopted temporary emission reduction measures in beijing we have every reason to say that today the emission reduction is very much lower than the ordinary level in beijing
2356561 beijing municipal government has taken 13 stages of steps and more than 200 measures to reduce the pollutant emission from the motor vehicles coal fire units construction sites and the industrial pollution sites
2356562 the days meeting the relevant standard has increased from 100 to 246 days
2356563 since july 1 measures to improve air quality conditions have been implemented including the specific traffic control for the motor vehicles shut down the heavily polluting industries and construction sites
2356564 with these efforts the emission was greatly reduced by 30 percent
2356565 the fog you see is based on humidity and heat there can be pollution but the fog is not necessarily pollution
2356566 i am only doing what i perceive as best for my health and upcoming competition

2356570 it can almost rob the drier regions of their rainfall

2356573 the government is collaborating actively with international partners on prevention detection and research and is taking every practical step to ensure that the u k is prepared to limit the internal spread of a pandemic and to minimize health economic and social harm as far as possible

2356608 you have a cockswinging irreverence for academic formality yet backed up your topic with solid analytical methodology
2356609 way to go pidge for highlighting such a riproaring exchange of opinion
2356610 theyll see us coming in and have a press conference in english then say well take care of you when were done
2356611 we do things outside the realm of news but it gives an image to the viewers that we care
2356612 we just dont have the support and infrastructure within our society to support the growing needs of the hispanic aging population
2356613 you have to understand the context in which a person lives their relationship to family the housing they need transportation
2356614 people want to solve their own problems even though there is treatment and health care available
2356615 we are trained to be responsible for our parents hasta al final to the very end
2356616 if i ever win the lottery i would construct a nursing home to fill the needs of elderly hispanics
2356617 the greek anti doping body has requested that the greek athletics federation withdraw the athlete from the games
2356618 it was not an ioc test it is a greek affair it is a national case
2356619 all necessary action to clarify the incident and a further statement will follow after the second sample is analyzed
2356620 prevention is straightforward prevent bites and vaccinate those at risk of bites
2356621 ive learned a lot become a better professional and a better man because of my experience and my time in new york i dont regret or feel ashamed about anything that happened to me in my time in new york
2356622 the most difficult part is just the realization that the organization no longer wants you
2356623 you spend eight years there and in the blink of an eye youre no longer wanted there
2356624 it makes me feel good i know im a good quarterback and i can play this game and can start and help a team win
2356625 i certainly dont want to compromise my position and the things that are going on
2356626 im glad to have a few teams interested and im excited about that
2356627 south east asia has plummeted to levels it took europe 150 years to reach in just 30 years
2356628 the span of fertility across countries has never been wider
2356629 both extremes cause their own problems if europe continues at 1 5 the population will halve every 65 years if africa continues with half its population under 15 it will continue to consume more than it produces making it harder to escape from poverty and illiteracy
2356630 if i were a gambler i would take even money that england will not exist in the year 2000
2356631 people are very bad at calculating survival probabilities twenty years ago fertility started to decline in nepal and bangladesh when they were still poor korea wasnt rich when fertility declined by contrast the gulf oil states continued with high birthrates long after they got huge wealth
2356632 theres been an extraordinary change in 20 years and it comes from a combination of factors
2356633 they have had 5 to 6 per cent economic growth over the past 15 years and in areas like the textile industry that provides work for lots of ordinary people a woman can earn 25 30 a month in a garment factory thats big money and if you have two daughters working it is delaying the age at which women marry it used to be 14 or 15 now its 21 or 22 another factor is the success of ngos non governmental organisations 20 million households in bangladesh have access to micro finance and in half of them the money goes to the women then there has been education for girls encouraged by programmes that gave cereals to families whose girls went to secondary school and cash for education female stipends
2356634 in africa most women work in agriculture around the home
2356635 but in bangladesh women get out and meet other women at work who may be using contraception getting outside the home fixes a new social norm prosperity and fertility are interlinked in a chicken and egg way
2356636 food sex and procreation are core elements of humanity and changes to them are often met with fierce hostility
2356637 in my view the evidence is that there is something intrinsic to the culture its there in the rich muslim states in the gulf in saudi arabia and in the muslim provinces of the former soviet union it is perhaps bound up with the status of women
2356638 not just in catholic spain and italy but in orthodox greece the strong traditions are not boosting fertility rate as many might suppose
2356639 many women in the developed world will become overloaded and respond by cutting down the number of children they have
2356640 my job is going to be difficult either way theres a lot of pressure to just be a starting quarterback in this league
2356641 im still following bretts legacy regardless of the fact if hes here retired or like he is in new york now
2356642 theres high expectations on myself on our team and i think its still going to be a difficult situation as far as the pressure outside this locker room thats put on me
2356643 it was good to get a resolution to the whole thing its been definitely on all of our minds weve had to talk about it a lot throughout the training camp
2356644 everybody in the locker room were happy for brett that he gets to still play and were going to move forward together as a team
2356645 a sense of relief you could say it in a lot of ways im about press conferenced out number one thats something its a responsibility i understand but it was something that the situation needed to be resolved and it was nice to get to a finality of that
2356646 im relieved that were talking about football our football team and thats what the focus needs to be on
2356647 im just reassured of the fact that things happen for a reason just to trust god in every situation and try and remain patient and even keeled because theres going to be ups and downs in life as in football and the things you cant control are the things often you want to worry about the most
2356648 but its really useless to worry about those because theyre really out of your control this situation was a prime example of that
2356649 the thing that wouldve happened potentially is a quarterback competition that was kind of the worst option i guess you could say which wasnt even a bad option at all
2356650 they told me i was the starter back in march and i worked hard to figure out ways to exert my leadership on this team get to know guys a little more
2356651 when all this stuff kind of went on last week i realized the very worst case scenario was being able having to compete for my job so that wasnt a bad situation
2356652 the olympics for china is a giant spectacle a game but for us its much more than that its a chance to call attention to what is happening in tibet
2356653 how perfect expected and fortuitous not to mention profitable that tijuana bible evolved as the go to moniker for pornographic mod texts
2356654 not that you need catchy names to move porn but anything sexual with the name tijuana attached to it assured that the consumer would be confronted with some beastly swarthy over the top sexual witnessing that would leave them ready to empty their gonadic profits onto sheets tissues sheep or worse
2356655 one of the very best science fiction debuts i have ever read
2356656 local residents made it clear that they value their green spaces and want to see them retained for future generations the planning applications submitted simply fail to do this
2356657 i was disappointed that leeds girls high school chose not to attend the meeting they need to hear what residents think about these proposals
2356658 way too much time on your hands there buddy analyzing pornography great blog though

2356662 left her 4 inches shorter and on crutches and she had gained a good deal of weight
2356663 in the fall of 1974 mccain was transferred to jacksonville as the executive officer of replacement air group 174 the long sought flying billet at last a reality a few months later he assumed command of the rag which trained pilots and crews for carrier deployments the assignment was controversial some calling it favoritism a sop to the famous son of a famous father and grandfather both were navy admirals since he had not first commanded a squadron the usual career path
2356664 off duty usually on routine cross country flights to yuma and el centro john started carousing and running around with women to make matters worse some of the women with whom he was linked by rumor were subordinates at the time the rumors were so widespread that true or not they became part of mccains persona impossible not to take note of

2356666 late afternoon gathering spot where senators and staffers usually from the armed services and foreign relations committees would drop in for a drink and the chance to unwind
2356667 she was lovely intelligent and charming 17 years my junior but poised and confident i monopolized her attention the entire time taking care to prevent anyone else from intruding on our conversation when it came time to leave the party i persuaded her to join me for drinks at the royal hawaiian hotel by the evenings end i was in love
2356668 the disparity between rich and poor is probably unmatched anywhere in the world you have the heads of multinational corporations billionaires but of the year round population half the work force are undocumented immigrants living below the poverty level
2356669 and if you havent heard of ozzy osbourne by now its a big fucking laugh
2356670 we cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives that weve set
2356671 weve got to have a civilian national security force thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded
2356672 the main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing
2356673 it just tells you that we are headed into uncharted territory
2356674 for 400 years immigrants have come to our shores worked hard had families and built the most successful nation in history
2356675 the notion that we are going to be the one group that does not become american is ridiculous
2356676 there are some communities and state governments that will have challenges
2356677 we think that for the u s olympic audience we can add a lot to what they can currently get through other sites
2356678 our goal is to extend our sports coverage for our loyal audience who comes to us for sports news every day of the year but also to bring a new audience to the experience
2356679 this is all about communities which latino people go to the games and who is cheering for which team
2356680 all of these experiences are being brought into terra usa and with the fan zone people are able to communicate with each other and send messages of support to their favorite athletes and teams
2356681 ts the start of what is going to be the new terra in terms of our look and feel and how we look in the future
2356682 i know the state economy is really good maybe some areas arent as good as in the past but they are still good and minot is the jewel of north dakota oil is going to impact the real estate market in the next couple of years the base is going to have an impact also housing is supply and demand and the demand is high while the supply is going to get a little low
2356683 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2356684 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices
2356685 with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly
2356686 and i think they need to work through that process of healing my sense is that thats going to be their top priority
2356687 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2356688 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2356689 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2356690 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private
2356691 i am proud of the courage john showed by his honesty in the face of shame
2356692 i ask that the public who expressed concern about the harm johns conduct has done to us think also about the real harm that the present voyeurism does and give me and my family the privacy we need at this time
2356693 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false
2356694 used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it
2356695 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2356696 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2356697 help two friends and former colleagues rebuild their lives when harassment by supermarket tabloids made it impossible for them to move forward on their own
2356698 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter it is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen
2356699 i want to see our party lead on the great moral issues yes me a democrat using that word the great moral issues that face our country
2356700 if we want to live in a moral honest just america and if we want to live in a moral and just world we cant wait for somebody else to do it we have to do it
2356701 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false
2356702 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2356703 but what were working on now is how does it stand on its own what will the program look like how do we establish our part of the market and who are the folks we want involved
2356704 not for a long time have i been in front of the camera
2356705 but its fun a lot of fun and the show is like putting the pieces of a puzzle together like organizing functions and conventions when i worked in hotels but on a smaller scale thats the most fun to put the show together
2356706 reaching the hispanic market a couple of years ago was in the early stages
2356707 but were the fastest growing population in kentucky i would say 100 000 people comfortably and everybody can have a piece of the pie there could possibly be room for two tv programs enough for two radio programs
2356708 as latinos we know really what people in the community care about whats important to us there are only a few people working at al dia but we are all heavily involved in the community its a business but we are committed to our community
2356709 what happens and ive seen this personally is that a prospective advertiser will look at the u
2356710 with the census we all know those are inaccurate numbers there are lots of aliens people who dont get counted the undocumented and if the numbers show 15 000 people in the louisville metro area we multiply that by three thats a rule of thumb we have to kind of do the old school way with advertisers and educate them
2356711 im too frightened to eat if you want me to show you im not al qaida ill eat all of these dishes
2356712 i decided it was time to get the fuck out of crazy town
2356713 but if you dont have a shit ton of money youre not welcome there anymore i needed a break and by that i mean like a fucking five year break
2356714 we had no idea what would happen as soon as a week or two after we signed the whole hipster thing and then this crazy backlash
2356715 if you offer two broke musicians 100 grand and the opportunity to get their music heard i dont care who they are theyre gonna take it
2356716 we have a certain base to work from but well probably have to struggle with all the bullshit thats swirled around us until were fat and bald and 75 so im looking at this as the first chapter of a fresh start
2356717 three years ago everyone was saying lets call these guys the heavy metal white stripes
2356718 so unique it could fundamentally change the rules of open world games by blending action and strategy
2356719 in the 1960s a mafia don was only as strong as his family
2356720 we found the hierarchical culture of organized crime intriguing running an organized crime family in a world defined by family loyalty is something that we felt could introduce a new strategic element to the genre that is what the dons view is all about laying out a strategy to pick off the competition one by one the dons view is so unique it could fundamentally change the rules of open world games by blending action and strategy to create something entirely new

2356770 i happened to find a sport thats pretty low key
2356771 i worked hard at it but i never thought of the olympics
2356772 anders and i were the fat kids before rowing we werent living healthy lives
2356773 both strive to make sure that neither quits its a motivational thing
2356774 but when youre done its a satisfying sport you know you have certain benchmarks youll make and you look forward to the next time youre not rowing

2356780 there were about eight bright orange lights moving very slowly
2356781 we got the binoculars out to have a closer look and all we could see was a big burning glow
2356782 admittedly i had been drinking but there were others at the barbecue who hadnt who could verify what we saw
2356783 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2356784 at first we just thought it was lights but then we saw there were about 13 of them in the shape of a cross
2356785 the lights were orange flicking on and off over the space of 10 minutes they got smaller in the sky and disappeared one by one
2356786 to be honest we were very frightened because it was something so strange the sky was clear and the lights just kept getting smaller
2356787 the children were frightened and kept asking questions about it if they would come and take them logan was in my lap upset
2356788 we know it shouldnt be here ive always believed in something else but seeing is believing

2356797 we have six weddings and thats quite unusual for a friday
2356798 when my fianc proposed he chose 08 08 08 because he thought it would be nice for my family
2356799 when a customer sees a home the numbers can make a big first impression
2356800 if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself
2356801 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness
2356802 any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby
2356803 we cannot think of a better day to celebrate the beginning of a happy new family and the happiest moment for our country these two things should go hand in hand
2356804 we will always choose a lucky date for important events such as giving birth in the year of the pig or getting married or starting a new business venture on a prosperous date
2356805 if it werent for today we would have chosen valentines day to get married
2356806 chinese people always believe in the lucky number eight but there have also been many tragedies in 2008
2356807 no podemos regresar al statu quo no podemos ceder lo ganado a estas bandas armadas porque

2356811 the fact that weve been touring so much is probably why some folks around here havent heard of us
2356812 and im ok with that since we do want to incorporate some spacier elements into our sound
2356813 were having a lot of fun and i think thats the point
2356814 but with this new album we are definitely ready to step it up
2356815 we didnt even know that when it finally did come out if anyone would like the record
2356816 luckily the reaction has been very good and we already have enough songs written for another record
2356817 i dont think the clean sound is necessarily what we envisioned
2356818 we are all more fans of records that are thought of being on the dirty side
2356819 we wanted to make music thats not going to be outdated stuff that doesnt have a time limit
2356820 we all try and listen to and digest a lot of old and new music
2356821 gram parsons as well as stuff that came out last month
2356822 we do whatever we can when we are back home

2356824 the day after the show the songs on our page had more plays than ever before
2356825 all you gotta do is drive down any street theres horticulture in every yard varying amounts of it and varying amounts of interest but its always there if you want to be a purely capitalistic standpoint if youre trying to market a home a good landscape will definitely increase the value of a home i think a lot of people just enjoy being out they enjoy the therapeutic value of growing plants and things i think

2356834 se ha tratado como nunca antes el problema del estigma y la discriminaci n hacia las poblaciones vulnerables y salimos con el firme compromiso de cambiar la situaci n
2356835 definitivamente se ha comprendido el mensaje de que no podemos estar trabajando por separado tratamiento y prevenci n por cada 2 000 pacientes al d a que empiezan la terapia otros 7 000 individuos han contra do el vih si duplic ramos el n mero de pacientes que toman los f rmacos no llegar amos a cubrir a todos los que los necesitan y si reduj ramos en un 50 la cifra de nuevas infecciones tampoco lo conseguir amos debemos buscar un maridaje entre ambas cosas

2356840 iron is the single most important micronutrient bacteria need to survive

2356842 the clear finding was that people with a higher level of education were more likely to say that suicide attacks against westerners in iraq are justified

2356844 thankfully we dont have to worry about fitting this title on a package
2356845 so unique it could fundamentally change the rules of open world games by blending action and strategy
2356846 ive been skeptical about the edwards story from the beginning not because i think that any random politician is better than that
2356847 my official stance is that unless its a matter of hypocrisy its none of your damn business
2356848 im not going to get on a high horse about his judgment because he didnt get on a high horse with me about mine thats all im going to say about that
2356849 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years
2356850 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2356851 when you crawl in bed with someone you not only need to think about your wife and kids
2356852 but you need to think how it affects the livelihood of people who are in the trenches and stand on the porches of voters and say it cant be
2356853 had this party in his hands he was wildly popular and all the time in the back of his head he knew the other shoe would drop
2356854 how do you go out and ask people to be part of your vision
2356855 egregious even predatory because his wife was suffering from a very serious condition and nationally they put themselves out there as the family
2356856 whats particularly disturbing is that john edwards put himself out there as a populist an angry fighter for the ordinary person whom politicians have been so out of touch with
2356857 he was their guy their champion the person who would give them a voice
2356858 the idea for many democrats was that he and obama would stay together and he would end up as attorney general
2356859 hell be lucky if he gets away with his car his hairbrush and his travel bag
2356860 i dont think theres any coincidence he decided to put this out between news regarding the trade of quarterback brett favre and the beginning of the olympics late on a friday afternoon
2356861 the story was a fire that either had to be extinguished or as the case turned out to be the damage limited by getting this out right now

2356870 we conducted several workshops and more than 600 parish employees and volunteers attended
2356871 the new decree which was expanded by eight pages is available in book form or online
2356872 this decree seeks to protect enhance and in some cases restore the trust that our faith calls for between the church and the children and adolescents entrusted to their care
2356873 it is the intention of the archdiocese that no person who has been convicted of sexually abusing a child will work with children at an office parish school agency or institution of the archdiocese
2356874 i couldnt believe it i had a headache this morning i felt very bad i couldnt imagine how i would shoot feeling this bad
2356875 i scored 399 points to the final and im satisfied with it
2356876 but as for the final i wasnt fully prepared for the pressure of competing at home
2356877 tell manny ill split my purse with him if he lets me take his place in that fight
2356878 he doesnt want to fight a guy that big so let me do his work and hell still get paid
2356879 ill be campaigning at 47 54 60 or 68 it all depends on whos out there looking
2356880 if there are guys out there wondering why no one will fight them theyve got someone now no matter who it is thats my mindset
2356881 it seems like theyre the ones always trying to find a reason not to fight me
2356882 its always williams isnt marketable or williams isnt on my level the way i look at it margarito is in the same weight class as me and i beat him yet hes considered the best welterweight lets see him avenge his loss before he calls himself the best
2356883 paul is always about the biggest and most compelling fights
2356884 its margaritos turn this time to do his best to change the verdict and paul is saying you gave me the chance and now ill be happy to give you the same opportunity the offer is quite simple
2356885 this is a major fight for our sport and one that would draw tremendous fan and media interest
2356886 i like him and hes got skills but he got out when it was time to get out
2356887 he can move around a lot but he cant duck all of them
2356888 with jennings being the mandatory its my job to go in there and punish him
2356889 hes the mandatory contender and hes coming to try and get my belt so thats all the motivation i need to try and remain a champion

2356898 it appears that u s olympic athletes have a far better sense of the olympic spirit than the usoc or the olympic host farrow said by choosing lopez lomong u s athletes are sending a powerful message they want the world to remember the anguished people of sudan
2356899 during a sunday morning mass 17 years ago the 6 year old lomong along with about 100 other children was taken at gunpoint from his parents driven away blindfolded in a truck and dumped in a cramped windowless one room prison full of boys
2356900 they would go to sleep and never stand up again
2356901 thats why they still look like such a mess we ran for three days and nights they would hide me in a cave while two of them went to get water they would fetch some back for me in a big leaf
2356902 so that we did not run back in the wrong direction toward the guards or run in circles
2356903 not long ago lomong told a half dozen track teammates
2356904 in response to the recent coverage of the correspondence dated back to 2000 the archbishop canterbury has made the following statement in the light of recent reports based on private correspondence from eight years ago i wish to make it plain that as i have consistently said i accept resolution i 10 of the 1998 lambeth conference as stating the position of the worldwide anglican communion on issues of sexual ethics and thus as providing the authoritative basis on which i as archbishop speak on such questions that resolution also recognises the need for continuing study and discussion on the matter in the past as a professional theologian i have made some contributions to such study but obviously no individuals speculations about this have any authority of themselves our anglican church has never exercised close control over what individual theologians may say however like any church it has the right to declare what may be said in its name as official doctrine and to define the limits of legitimate practice as archbishop i understand my responsibility to be to the declared teaching of the church i serve and thus to discourage any developments that might imply that the position and convictions of the worldwide communion have changed
2356905 our anglican church has never exercised close control over what individual theologians may say however like any church it has the right to declare what may be said in its name as official doctrine and to define the limits of legitimate practice
2356906 only recently have people started to carry around so much personal information and entertainment content with them mobiles have become a digital treasure trove and we need to be made aware of their true value its not just about the glossy handset
2356907 it is our hope that all democrats and all republicans can stand together to celebrate american energy freedom day on october 1 2008 on that day the current prohibitions on oil and gas leasing on most of the outer continental shelf and on oil shale leasing on federal lands will expire unless congress acts to extend them we strongly encourage you to allow the expiration of these prohibitions on american energy exploration and production as scheduled under current law and will actively oppose any attempt to extend them
2356908 when these prohibitions expire on october 1 2008 as part of the consolidated appropriations act 2008 public law 110 161 all americans will benefit for vast amounts of american petroleum and natural gas will immediately become available for leasing activities estimates from the minerals management service and the bureau of land management indicate that there are upwards of 18 billion barrels of recoverable crude oil on the currently off limit areas of the outer continental shelf as well as more than 55 trillion cubic feet of natural gas estimates of american oil shale vary widely but range from the hundreds of billions of barrels to trillions of barrels of oil
2356909 this legislation would also jeopardize national security by increasing our vulnerability to an oil supply disruption rather than drawing down a strategic reserve intended to protect our nations energy security from a severe supply disruption congress should pass legislation to increase domestic oil supply
2356910 supporting the goals and ideals of the international year of sanitation
2356911 we strongly advise you not to travel to the regions of south ossetia abkhazia and the pankisi gorge north of akhmeta because of the threat of terrorist and criminal activity related to local separatist movements
2356912 the movie industry has been pushing the envelope and a lot of young ladies feel to be popular thats what they should wear
2356913 the fashion industry markets what sells they make it very difficult for moms who want to find their daughters a decent dress
2356914 i really think it helps just by having an enforcer there and knowing if they came in with the wrong kind of dress someone is going to make it appropriate
2356915 they were more careful in their dress selection this year they shopped harder
2356916 at least in her casual clothes she had the same design made up in four or five color combinations
2356917 i suppose she liked the way it fit and felt you hang on to whats good on you you get that pattern and the sky is the limit for what you can do with it
2356918 the clp ran a sort of one trick pony campaign
2356919 the only grab opposition leader terry mills seemed to get up during the campaign was the 83 per cent rise in violent crime and we all know that the underlying reason for that rise is the counting of domestic violence in those figures
2356920 i am struggling to see what seats that labor will lose
2356921 i know that the pundits are saying theyre going to lose some seats but i dont see that and i will have to wait like everyone else for tonight to see whether my views actually come to fruition
2356922 its a bit hard to know whether there will be a really good correlation between the territory wide vote and what happens in terms of seats
2356923 if they do badly at this election there may well be an outbreak of a central australian party and that would threaten the clp
2356924 what weve seen in the last three territory elections is that there can be massive swings out there
2356925 it has happened in the northern territory a handful of votes in a handful of seats will determine the outcome of this election and im fighting very hard to hold each and every of the 19 seats we have
2356926 i dont count chickens before theyve hatched i just focus on crossing that line
2356927 my focus has been on delivering good honest leadership and making sure that weve presented a clear alternative to territorians and i believe weve done that
2356928 democrats have a commonsense plan to help bring down skyrocketing gas prices
2356929 if we want to live in a moral honest and just america we cant wait for somebody else to do it we have to do it
2356930 i was around him a lot it was great we went to africa the whole experience was life altering for me
2356931 stuffed with seasoned beef onions tomatoes and a touch of raisins
2356932 oh my god i think i remember these being made from heart no no see on the menu it just says beef ill ask
2356933 what is needed is a comprehensive statewide plan and we must move swiftly
2356934 invented the game of pool a game in which the player uses a white ball and a stick to knock a bunch of colored balls off a table and into a bunch of holes
2356935 if youre the black sheep of the family then you gotta be bad you know white sheep youre okay you know
2356936 see the world loves china we not do anything wrong every country like us no such thing as freedom all lies all lies
2356937 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2356938 the patrol flight of the strategic missile carrying aircraft lasted about 12 hours
2356939 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2356940 the neanderthal can let us know where to look for things that might be important in recent human evolution
2356941 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2356942 the army treats the shooting at point blank range of a bound man only as inappropriate behaviour it disgraces the values which it pretends to uphold
2356943 this case proves once again that the military judicial system views harming innocent citizens as a public image problem and not as a moral issue
2356944 harming a bound and helpless person is a shameful and cruel act and calls for an appropriately severe response
2356945 on a daily basis against palestinian kids who throw stones
2356946 of course they dont get that but they are frequently jailed for months
2356947 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2356948 there is a broad view by the public that our health care system needs a full overhaul either to be totally rebuilt or reformed
2356949 often paperwork doesnt arrive or your records arent available when you show up there are also concerns about getting timely access to care
2356950 also having a regular doctor who is available to see you getting timely referrals and having more affordable care are important to people
2356951 we now spend twice per capita what other developed nations spend on care yet we die younger have worse access to care and are even behind on medical computerization
2356952 these survey results are a clarion call for the health financing mechanism used elsewhere nonprofit national health insurance
2356953 we have seen the number of uninsured rise we have seen people facing higher out of pocket costs we see layers of complications in terms of billing problems
2356954 all that adds up to an american public that is quite ready for health care reform
2356955 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2356956 i am worried about my fathers health and safety given that he has not been freed
2356957 no military or official source told us where he was
2356958 we will continue our fight until we reach our goal
2356959 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2356960 and if anything goes wrong afterwards it is hushed up to prevent damage to the business
2356961 this fad illustrates the extremes to which embryonic stem cell use can lead
2356962 it is hard to believe that such atrocities are going on today
2356963 the ethical and moral ramifications of such treatments are staggering the experimental aspects are equally troubling
2356964 not only is the origin of the fetuses immoral and inhumane there are medical problems and complications associated with the injections
2356965 this savage and repulsive brave new world of human sacrifices in the quest for eternal youth is a prime example of the end results when all moral boundaries are destroyed
2356966 una vez terminado el juego el rey y el pe n vuelven a la misma caja
2356967 por m s diferencias que hagamos entre unos y otros al final terminamos en la cuenta que somos iguales
2356968 some firmly believe that bleached skin is also a sign of beauty
2356969 its not too hard to pick out someone who has applied these chemicals to their skin
2356970 the color of the epidermis takes on a reddish purplish tinge and often it has a different tone from skin on the neck hands and chest
2356971 everybody ran into the street because it felt like an earthquake it looks like a war zone in a hollywood movie and we just cant believe that jimmy walked away with no injuries his dog was just a little bit singed
2356972 when were sitting there coaching during the games it is hard to tell how good or bad it is sometimes but certainly i felt that some of the play was excellent tonight and im sure it must have been exciting to watch
2356973 if we can get a game like that in mls cup final between the two teams then i would vote for that as well
2356974 patrick gets a goal tonight he should have had two
2356975 the kid has matured a lot in the last three weeks hes a goal scorer he can pass the ball and make plays
2356976 all week in practice we talked about setting the tone early
2356977 it is our home field theres nothing to be scared of it was my first start i worked as hard as i could
2356978 tonight the hawks organization received an offer sheet from the memphis grizzlies for josh smith
2356979 we are happy to announce that we will match their offer sheet
2356980 ownership management and the team are happy to have josh return as a member of the hawks
2356981 on the whole i see the review as positive but it is long overdue and i want to make certain the attorney general actually releases the full report by justice moynihan and also ensure that he now doesnt fob it off to the queensland law reform commission as hes done in the past
2356982 hey i wonder how many other people are dropping kids off at the pool right now too
2356983 computer interfaces are often referred to as environments the natural world surrounding you is often called the environment we took a cue from the natural term and created livid looper
2356984 we expect the government to go hammer and tongs after dow chemical now that the law ministry has indicated that union carbides civil liabilities can be passed on to dow
2356985 we have won our demands only after facing undue harassment at the hands of the government and delhi police

2357148 one of my favorite spots on the internet is mirtles site i wont lie guy knows his stuff and is an excellent writer
2357149 mirtle looks like the kind of guy who would like to take you out to a nice dinner and talk hockey to you all night long
2357150 james mirtle is battling off wing for the title of
2357151 james mirtle bats out one heck of a hockey blog
2357152 want to know what sports blogging can look like when its in the hands of a real journalist
2357153 harvest is rather small but we have time noted villers if rains take place year may happen to be of bad harvest and if the weather improves crop may be satisfactory
2357154 the website was broken on august 6 the unknown added obscene texts and images there
2357155 i feel sorry for the people who use their talents and web skills to demonstrate low level of social and intellectual development in such an anti social manner after all those who spit at heaven at the church usually spit at his own soul
2357156 president ilves will be in france from august 10 16 he will not have any official meetings
2357157 the only aim of his trip is to attend an intensive language course at saint genies de comola to brush up his french
2357158 he will go to france alone without his spouse and as far as we know there are no other vips attending the language course
2357159 building off a lot of our momentum from last year will be key for us
2357160 we all feel we had a good spring we had a lot of kids in the gym which gave us the opportunity to work on our systems and try to improve upon our weaknesses
2357161 having basically everybody back is a big bonus especially because they had the off season to work on the physical components we got stronger as a team and especially the freshman they benefited from having an off season in our program to get stronger
2357162 our biggest challenge will be how all of the pieces fit together how were going to use our depth we have depth at every position
2357163 they each bring something a little bit different to the table
2357164 we will look to all of them for different reasons during the season
2357165 very experienced player who has played in a lot of big games for the team
2357166 her size definitely helps a lot shes a very intelligent player and is very physical she will have an impact for us this year
2357167 its hard for me to ever take her off the floor
2357168 building off a lot of our momentum from last year will be key for us
2357169 we all feel we had a good spring we had a lot of kids in the gym which gave us the opportunity to work on our systems and try to improve upon our weaknesses

2357176 its hard for me to ever take her off the floor
2357177 why in the world would people care what i had for dinner
2357178 the deep deep racial divisions within the party of jim crow
2357179 so racist that they dont even realize that white americans have moved on and so whenever there is a campaign like this such as this they always use racism in order to intimidate white americans
2357180 to what purpose are powers limited and to what purpose is that limitation committed to writing if these limits may at any time be passed by those intended to be restrained
2357181 senator kerry talked of reducing terrorism to quote nuisance end quote and compared it to prostitution and illegal gambling
2357182 see i couldnt disagree more our goal is not to reduce terror to some acceptable level of nuisance our goal is to defeat terror by staying on the offensive destroying terrorists and spreading freedom and liberty around the world
2357183 nor can we think of our goal in this war in the way senator kerry described it yesterday in the new york times
2357184 quote we have to get back to the place he said where terrorism is a nuisance sort of like and these are his comparisons
2357185 the struggle against violent extremists will not end with a single battle or campaign rather we will defeat them through the patient accumulation of quiet successes and the orchestration of all elements of national and international power we will succeed by eliminating the ability of extremists to strike globally and catastrophically while also building the capacity and resolve of local governments to defeat them regionally victory will include discrediting extremist ideology creating fissures between and among extremist groups and reducing them to the level of nuisance groups that can be tracked and handled by law enforcement capabilities
2357186 victory will include discrediting extremist ideology creating fissures between and among extremist groups and reducing them to the level of nuisance groups that can be tracked and handled by law enforcement capabilities
2357187 i believe i can fight a more effective more thoughtful more strategic more proactive more sensitive war on terror that reaches out to other nations and brings them to our side
2357188 america has been in too many wars for any of our wishes but not a one of them was won by being sensitive a sensitive war will not destroy the evil men who killed 3 000 americans and who seek the chemical nuclear and biological weapons to kill hundreds of thousands more the men who beheaded daniel pearl and paul johnson will not be impressed by our sensitivity
2357189 uttering just a few phrases through clenched teeth putin reminded investors of the risk threatening any investment in russia
2357190 the mechel case shows that ex president putin who formally resigned in may is still the man whose speech is listened to by foreign investors
2357191 putin talks investors listen and medvedev does nothing despite an earlier promise to refrain from interfering with the economy and to prove that russia is friendly towards investors
2357192 we are ecstatic that renato was found not guilty of the homicides
2357193 the jurors acted like women they were very organized very meticulous asked a lot of questions and made sure they had all their ducks in a row they were not going to rush the decision
2357194 it was a surprise the jury did the right thing even though its common sense
2357195 this whole situation changed a whole lot of lives including people in clearlake now i just hope they prosecute the real murderer
2357196 the jurors clearly did not believe mr hughes testimony because they found him guilty of burglary and of assault with a deadly weapon
2357197 i dont have a good explanation of why they wouldnt find him guilty of at least one homicide
2357198 we had a difficult legal theory and difficult facts so anything is possible
2357199 renato will be coming out but has justice been served no not until shannon edmonds is held accountable
2357200 this is justice compared to clearlake they were railroading my son i give all honor glory and praise to god for the verdict
2357201 im just glad they didnt convict renato of what he didnt do
2357202 if youre wondering why the economy protection office doesnt pay taxes properly then the answer is that we havent tried very hard to pay taxes in recent years i dont see any reason to pay for the lies and incompetence as well as wrong economic political decisions of the governing political power
2357203 of course we could be forced to pay the debt with laws and threats but i dont feel the least bit guilty for not actively helping to cover the expenses of the society
2357204 the decisions of the currently governing political power have taken the state to the edge of bankruptcy income is smaller than expenses let the government take responsibility those who have made economic decisions have taken our bread theres nothing to be taken from those who are in debt
2357205 i would rather approve the proposition circling the state that every company will pay the wage of a certain number of officials the state needs to operate we calculated that we could employ 1 5 police officers 0 5 doctors and pay pensions to 0 75 people we wont buy tanks and armoured vehicles as their motor power is more than 140 kw and as heard driving those will be taxed most likely from now on we will go to a hospital with a bag of plaster and pills in our pocket
2357206 he could no longer carry on living without having at least tried to conquer those towers
2357207 to what purpose are powers limited and to what purpose is that limitation committed to writing if these limits may at any time be passed by those intended to be restrained

2357220 a mom blogger is someone who specialises in blogging about her kids
2357221 all is well with the grace of allah here was that first line of assurance before arjumand began her letters she always put this line on the top it was something she had learnt from her grandfather ghias beg had taught her to tell the reader upon first perusal that the letter bore no bad news and leaving out that line would be warning of what was to come
2357222 ksemam acted as an assurance while one was trying to get to the main body of the letter while wading through all the respectful nonsense it was padded with
2357223 je vous prie dagr er madame monsieur lexpression de mes salutations distingu es
2357224 you allow another day just in case and go after 3 days
2357225 you fret and fume and promise yourself that you will never come back there and tell him her as much while he puts the finishing touches on the blouse kameez kurta he apologises but is not unduly disturbed about losing my custom he knows i will eventually return
2357226 with this kind of behaviour does she really think she is going to be able to live happily she will starve without anything to eat and she will die of a horrible disease for doing this to her husband and children
2357227 when we begin to draw down troops from iraq it will be from a position of strength and success not from a position of fear and failure

2357233 i was already freaked out because she was accusing me of stuff i didnt do
2357234 you dont go to jail because you like different restaurants do you
2357235 we did it at the hands of sheriffs deputies who burst through our front door rifles blazing
2357236 it was concluded that ms tomsic and the calvo family were innocent victims of drug traffickers
2357237 i called him to express my sorrow and regret for that and for the loss of the familys beloved dogs
2357238 the door flew open i heard gunfire shoot off there was a brief pause and more gunfire
2357239 i noticed my two dead dogs lying in pools of their own blood
2357240 it was that lack of communication that really led to what has really been the most traumatic experience of our lives
2357241 theyve arrested the real criminals involved were pleased to have that and get our name back as well but really this doesnt excuse what they did
2357242 we have a few openings we can do some temporary child care whatever we can do to make this difficult scenario for families a little bit easier
2357243 so the point that i was making at the time was that the political dynamic was the driving force between that sectarian violence and we could try to keep a lid on it but if these underlining dynamic continued to bubble up and explode the way they were then we would be in a difficult situation i am glad that in fact those political dynamic shifted at the same time that our troops did outstanding work
2357244 a general decision whether to try and develop this specific tax or not will probably be made during a month or two
2357245 weve got very little time before we go into caretaker mode so we really have to get this inquiry underway
2357246 support has always been there within the parliamentary labor caucus for morris iemma

2357296 however with new developments in europe being delayed and new regulations limiting land sales in china this sector may soon experience the same declining investment other property types have
2357297 it seems that weve got a lot of selling based on the stronger dollar
2357298 energy demand destruction and the dollar return have formed a quiet alliance to bring the oil market down and today the louder of the two is the dollar
2357299 the market has been ignoring the tbilisi pipeline situation and now the problems with russia the move lower really now has a momentum of its own with the financial players coming out
2357300 were at the lowest level in oil prices in months and there is a real feeling that the trend has turned
2357301 lower oil prices are good for businesses and good for consumers for the inflation picture and they will improve growth somewhere down the line
2357302 i think the trend in stocks is up i do feel that july 15 represented the bottom for stocks and we are going to move higher
2357303 i really feel that what investors are looking for right here is signs that the economy is starting to pick up right now
2357304 it looks like we are finally getting the break weve been waiting for in terms of slowing down the inflation spiral that has been taking place
2357305 you have a tremendous rise in the dollar and thats putting pressure on crude oil which is helping to buoy u s equity markets
2357306 clearly the economy is still weak some of the stimulus from the tax rebates is
2357307 i think the key to watch for is the unemployment number once you go above 6 percent the concerns about recession will go up
2357308 look at the prices of food around the world its unfair to look at just the price of oil as the leading indicator of where inflation trends may be
2357309 theres strong likelihood that the fed is going to have to start to raise interest rates to control inflation
2357310 for a long term investor id advocate slowly going back into commodities right now gold will be my favorite recommendation

2357350 all of a sudden the rules have changed and people are being told about on one months notice
2357351 everybodys finding it tougher to make ends meet at the end of the month and you add up all these charges this kind of gouging its not fair its not right and we wanna see legislation to put a stop to it

2357370 we had some situations where we could have scored some big runs and he got some big outs when he needed to
2357371 we just didnt hit the ball well and he made some good pitches

2357381 our goal is to see a crowd of 75 000 people at obamas nomination speech holding their hands above their heads fingers laced together in support of a new direction for this country a renewed hope and acceptance of responsibility for our future
2357382 we thought lets try and start a movement where even while walking down the street people would hold up the o and you would know that they were for obama
2357383 you interlace your hands in a circle the interlacing being a symbol of different types of people coming together and the circle a symbol of unity

2357390 the virus writers dont need me they are not going to take my course
2357391 i want to teach a generation of experts and technologists to be ethical and be aware and be knowledgeable and contribute something to it
2357392 you dont have to write a virus to understand them and how to detect them
2357393 the time spent to write a virus is worthless any student at a college beyond the first few courses who cant write a virus probably shouldnt be there because its not a difficult algorithm to write

2357397 computer professionals know little or nothing with regard to malware it would be as if a physician knew as much about microbiology as the average person on the street that would be unacceptable imagine if doctors deferred all decisions to pharmaceutical companies but thats what security professionals do with malware
2357398 if he thinks socializing our programs is the way to go fine but that still doesnt justify writing viruses

2357406 weve identified and blocked the ability to link to the malicious websites from anywhere on facebook
2357407 enterprises need to have a presence on the web and they want to be relevant
2357408 but stories like this signal the need for sites like facebook and myspace to filter and be more proactive
2357409 this happens every time some cool new technology comes along that attracts a lot of users
2357410 weve seen it with e mail and instant messaging their popularity makes them a become a big target for the bad guys

2357436 no gun gets out of here unless theres a background check
2357437 if we dont have a good handle on this at usamriid its probably true we dont have a good handle on it across the board

2357562 but what about sending political activists and gop operatives to iraq in the guise of journalists with the cooperation of the u s military and on the taxpayers dime so that the activists can come home and proselytize for the republican presidential candidates position on the war

2357829 as a precautionary measure the subway chain voluntarily withdrew specific batches of philly style steak and chicken fajita products from sale as soon as it became aware of a potential food safety issue highlighted by dawn farm foods last weekend
2357830 no other products are affected by this action and alternative supplies of the philly style steak and chicken fajita have been sourced
2357831 this is a highly complicated outbreak investigation focusing on products from one thermal processing line with a complex food distribution chain

2357834 were aware of the match coming up but we are monitoring the situation through our embassy in sofia and our contacts in the european union and we will contact the fai closer to the time
2357835 weve been in this situation before weve had two wars and an earthquake to deal with so were used to monitoring changing situations but we always take the advice of foreign affairs and the fai
2357836 were also monitoring the situation through our own contacts in georgia but we havent had any calls about it yet
2357837 yet again children who are at risk or are victims of abuse are not deemed to be a financial priority for the government
2357838 when people pluck up the courage to make a call and ask for help and then have to wait on a waiting list we just have to think it is completely unacceptable
2357839 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want
2357840 although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2357841 when a supermarket tabloid told a version of the story i used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it but being 99 percent honest is no longer enough
2357842 when i asked her how she was doing she said this is really really tough

2357868 factual recounting of our family history i think it would be advantageous to all family historians to gain an understanding of this relatively new genre creative non fiction also known as literary or narrative nonfiction is a genre of writing which uses literary craft in presenting nonfiction it is factually accurate prose about real people and events written in a compelling and vivid manner creative non fiction writers dont make things up they make ideas that already exist more interesting and accessible forms within this genre include personal essays memoir travel writing food writing biography literary journalism and family histories in the book the art of fact literary critic barbara lounsberry suggests four characteristics of the creative non fiction genre chosen from the real world as opposed to invented from the writers mind
2357869 permits them to establish the credibility of their narratives through verifiable references in their texts
2357870 the importance of describing and revivifying the context of events in contrast to the typical journalistic style of objective reportage a literary prose style
2357871 verifiable subject matter and exhaustive research guarantee the nonfiction side of literary nonfiction the narrative form and structure disclose the writers artistry and finally its polished language reveals that the goal all along has been literature

2357873 copyright is a form of protection offered by the laws of the u
2357874 it is a protection available to published and unpublished works and is a vital first step in combating piracy
2357875 we have to develop a business model that basically makes suing people for copyright infringement a viable revenue stream
2357876 the industry has to unite and be ready to go all the way in litigation to deter these criminals and set an example for others
2357877 what this program did was introduce young students to the dangers of gambling by demonstrating mathematical probability and the real world facts that gamblers rarely win
2357878 must delegate the power of divorce to his new bride
2357879 i dont really know that she needed help the only thing i know so far is she was asking where the albertsons is so we dont know if something happened to her or she was just asking for an address
2357880 nobody called 9 1 1 because the victim did not tell exactly to us what was going on
2357881 she did sustain some bruising as a result of the attack
2357882 in a situation like this where this young girl was so easily manipulated because of the fact that she was so in fear of her life it just makes it so much worse that this person would have taken advantage of her this way

2357885 just as i have a seemingly endless capacity to bare my ass and get it smacked soundly or make a squirming bottom hover on the edge of erotic oblivion with loud ringing stinging whack after whack i dont think ill ever get tired of reading stories about spanking

2357887 we have no doubt that this copying has been willful and is intended to trade upon the fame and cachet of the lv trademarks to elevate the status of the infringing guitar strap and of janes addiction

2357893 we believe the attorney general has attempted to influence voters against this measure
2357894 it is our goal to ensure that voters have a fair opportunity to decide this measure for themselves on election day
2357895 i think there is no question the reason why the attorney general put the negative language in there is to torpedo the proposition because people generally dont vote for negative propositions
2357896 what in fact happens in this proposition is that it preserves marriage and family and preserves the stability of society
2357897 i believe that notwithstanding the negative language the people of california will know that this is about protecting marriage and pass the amendment despite resistance by the courts and the attorney general
2357898 i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness
2357899 you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself

2357904 why did you hang on why were you so insistent on hanging on to this guy
2357905 we dont want to put out there that we expect citizens to take action like that
2357906 but absolutely this gentleman taking action like that led to the arrest and clearance of this case and put a real bad guy behind bars
2357907 you know its just one less its such a small percentage of people like that one less percentage wise thats got to be huge
2357908 a u s department health and human services proposed regulation that would protect freedom of conscience for pro life physicians and pharmacists will likely be rewritten to reflect pro abortion demands
2357909 ive received no official communication on what is going on today

2357923 once again the people of california are held hostage by a tyrannical judicial system determined to implement a radical social agenda
2357924 it is shameful that activist judges and politicians are throwing every obstacle they can in the way of restoring the true definition of marriage
2357925 traditional marriage advocates intend to appeal the courts clearly biased ruling despite the opposition of our traditional marriage opposing judges and politicians we will fight on our children and our families depend upon our fortitude and perseverance
2357926 in response to the ad critical of barack obama that john mccain had aired which included paris hilton
2357927 sounds like paris is taking the all of the above energy approach that john mccain has advocated both alternatives and drilling perhaps the reality is that paris has a more substantive energy plan than barack obama
2357928 our parents wouldnt let us go see them back then
2357929 here come the jesters 1 2 3 its all part of my fantasy i love the music and i love to see the crowd dancing in the aisles and singing out loud yeah

2357934 a government action that decreases the spirituality the fervor or the satisfaction with which a believer practices his religion is not what congress has labeled a substantial burden on the free exercise of religion
2357935 can you imagine what they would do if they found out i was a christian

2357937 islamic scholars say the original rulings on apostasy were similar to those for treasonous acts in legal systems worldwide and do not apply to an individuals choice of religion
2357938 just as muslims have a right to invite others to join islam christians have a right to invite others to jesus

2357940 in certain areas like malia on crete bombes are a real problem
2357941 we may talk a lot about the attitude of tourists and their excessive drinking but often its the alcohol thats at fault if we dont solve this problem and get rid of bombes greeces image will be tainted
2357942 until now officials have only been able to conduct such checks until 2pm which is a bit of a paradox when its clearly such a big issue
2357943 with these new rules theyll be able to go into bars at any time of the night and day
2357944 its all part of our effort to discourage the wild behaviour that sadly is often encouraged by tour operators in britain
2357945 were not interested in quantity but the quality of tourism in greece
2357946 you got into these small towns in pennsylvania and like a lot of small towns in the midwest the jobs have been gone now for 25 years and nothings replaced them and they fell through the clinton administration and the bush administration and each successive administration has said that somehow these communities are gonna regenerate and they have not and its not surprising then they get bitter they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who arent like them or anti immigrant sentiment or anti trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations

2357958 i didnt know everybody was supposed to know especially when it wasnt a done deal and it wouldnt go down i signed a three possibly four year deal here im committed to fulfill that contract if next year doesnt work out with the option ill be a free agent and i can choose where i go
2357959 i dont know how many years i have left ive had a good time here in san diego like ive preached before the same games weve been the last couple of years that weve won we havent won any of those this year given our division and how young it is its going to be inconsistent for the next two or three years so i feel theres an opportunity here obviously there are pieces missing and we need to address those pieces
2357960 its a really good thing she isnt asking for 100s
2357961 through this we hope to make more people aware of the situation inside tibet china and burma and hopefully people with good consciences will join us and put pressure on the government
2357962 and with pressure from the international community we hope the chinese government will produce some tangible results right now all of the media is focused on the opening ceremonies its supposed to be the biggest ceremonies ever so were doing this to show people that china is not as glorious as they claim to be its a totally different picture in tibet
2357963 we are here to let people know that we are fed up with the continuation of human rights abuses in china
2357964 right now in tibet we have one of the worst crackdowns one of the most repressive times since the cultural revolution
2357965 thousands of monks have been locked up in their monasteries or taken away to other parts until the beijing games are over

2357968 but also if they can do that then i can do something as creative
2357969 the things were planning to do are on track and judging from what ive heard about the timing for beijing and where they were at certain times were in good shape
2357970 its not going to be a mad rush at the end
2357971 it reminds us that the next time our olympic athletes take part in the opening ceremony and the next time the drama of the olympic cauldron lighting stirs everyones hearts as it did tonight it will be at home in 2010
2357972 what a proud night for china and for all canadians as we get ready to be the next host and share that same stage of honour
2357973 the most important thing about food service is to serve the cold food cold and the hot food hot
2357974 please if i wrap a moussaka and a lamb shank will you take them home and have them for dinner tomorrow
2357975 i dont do this for any reason other than the fact that i love music
2357976 in the course of our research we were surprised by the amount of medical inaccuracies that these newspapers had published said dr ricracine of the institut de recherches cliniques de montr al ircm some journalists even wrote about mrs schiavos reactions to specific words or expressions supposedly showing that she was conscious
2357977 our observations show that the press capitalized on the controversy to a large extent and selling copies mattered more than delivering scientific information my empahsis media coverage sustained myths and false hopes
2357978 i forgot to tell you i love you and i will miss you and i didnt give you a hug you know in case you get in a car accident and forget who i am or worse well just know those things okay
2357979 the issue of cruelty to animals is an important issue for people and i think thats a positive thing

2357981 a major disruption to transnational organised crime both in this country and abroad
2357982 there have been 185 000 telephone intercepts in this operation there have been 400 members of the afp deployed to this operation there have been 10 000 hours of surveillance deployed to this operation to find the perpetrators of this worlds largest seizure and importation into our country
2357983 it is classic organised crime and we have done our best to shut down the syndicate
2357984 there are not many boardrooms in australia where you would write off half a billion dollars worth of a commodity or a product and continue your business
2357985 what we have to do is reach out to the youth of the country and reduce demand
2357986 while we certainly wont be going door to door in search of violations we are asking san diegans to report any water waste to the citys water department
2357987 i would encourage people to knock on their neighbors doors to let them know their sprinkler is broken before notifying the water department
2357988 these are recommendations for voluntary changes in behavior that we have shared many times before
2357989 what makes this list different is that all of these recommendations will become requirements should we implement the next steps in water conservation called out in the municipal code
2357990 if we move to mandatory restrictions violating these practices will be against the law

2357994 can you tell me how to get to sesame street
2357995 sesame street and busch gardens are both brands known for their unwavering commitment to quality combining the familiarity of sesame streets characters and busch gardens family friendly atmosphere makes for a natural partnership between these two iconic brands
2357996 the new sesame street attraction provides our youngest guests with kid size versions of our grown up rides offering them an introduction to the park that only busch gardens and sesame workshop can offer
2357997 the housing market has returned to earth fast and hard
2357998 in the markets conditions which many of us had already described as the worst in a generation took a turn for the worse
2357999 one of the worst fannie mae has experienced on the debt and equity markets
2358000 neither of these companies have properly provisioned for what were heading into
2358001 this thing is going to get worse and last longer and deeper than they originally thought
2358002 took political spin and turned it into a global business
2358003 we need to make restitution and make it promptly to those investors who find themselves trapped in this auction rate nightmare
2358004 if this is not war then i wonder what is
2358005 as a result of the hours long shelling of tskhinvali by heavy weaponry the city is almost totally destroyed
2358006 we cannot allow the deaths of our countrymen to go unpunished the guilty parties will receive the punishment they deserve
2358007 they have in effect begun hostilities using tanks and artillery
2358008 we have lost control over some parts of the city
2358009 whatever else may be thought about hitlers exploits they are among the most remarkable in the whole history of the world
2358010 eighty six percent of surveyed said they were content with the countrys direction up from 48 percent in 2002 and 82 percent of chinese were satisfied with their national economy up from 52 percent
2358011 russians were the third most satisfied people with their countrys direction at 54 percent despite western concerns about authoritarian trends
2358012 this is something that cannot be done unilaterally we will recommend that the island must not be left to itself as it has been in the past we must be pro active in terms of development
2358013 in this regard we will have to work closely with the government ideally johor should prepare the master plan as the island belongs to the state the ministry will have no problem assisting johor in developing the island
2358014 i cannot categorically reply because this expansion programme or any act that could go against the goodwill of being neighbours has not been brought to my attention
2358015 suffice to say the position of the island will be studied quickly in respect to the lighthouse and we would inform singapore in due course on what we want to do to the island
2358016 we will not allow history to repeat itself losing pedra branca to singapore is bad enough
2358017 the doctor informed us that our son would not live for more than a week and that his fingers would drop off
2358018 nobody realised that yee ser was in the room everyone was busy saving their belongings and carrying things out
2358019 only when she woke up and started screaming did some of us realise that she was still in the room
2358020 some of the others tried to break the glass window so that they could pull her through but before that could happen something fell on her pinning her down
2358021 the fire was raging by then and there was nothing we could do
2358022 we are saddened by what happened but glad in a way that the others escaped without any injuries
2358023 she was very lovable its really sad to have lost her
2358024 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2358025 i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness
2358026 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices and i had hoped that it would never become public
2358027 with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly but that misconduct took place for a short period in 2006 it ended then
2358028 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2358029 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
2358030 if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2358031 a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication our private matter could no longer be wholly private
2358032 i am proud of the courage john showed by his honesty in the face of shame the toll on our family of news helicopters over our house and reporters in our driveway is yet unknown
2358033 but now the truth is out and the repair work that began in 2006 will continue
2358034 its been a long struggle over the last three years or so but i can feel my game is swinging in the right direction
2358035 seventy one was probably the worst score i could have shot today its very encouraging for the next two rounds i think one or two over is going to win so im two back from that
2358036 after winning such a big tournament the us open i got lost with no direction at all
2358037 i felt id fulfilled my dream by winning and major and so i felt i couldnt go any further to be honest but now ive seen my friends trevor immelman geoff ogilvy angel cabrera and padraig harrington win majors its inspired me to come back and even hopefully do the same as padraig and win another major
2358038 i was getting too bogged down with technical thoughts i decided to free my mind and empty my cup of all swing thoughts and just went out and played golf im not trying to put a perfect swing on a perfect shot
2358039 im using a new driver new shaft and im gaining another 20 yards which is nice but whats really helped is confidence
2358040 confidence is something you cant get overnight and you cant buy it cant get it from a psychologist its the kind of thing that snowballs
2358041 theres a long way to go but from what ive been doing shooting 75s and 80s for such a long time thats completely gone now
2358042 i didnt serve very well in the third set the balls are pretty slow so it was difficult for my game
2358043 it was perfect for him because he was playing very simple tennis
2358044 i made a couple of mistakes and he started to feel much more comfortable on the court my momentum was gone
2358045 its just great to keep winning im living a dream and im now in the top 20
2358046 i hope i can keep this up against mardy tomorrow
2358047 happiness off court translates to a clear mind on court and thats the case for me
2358048 some members of the council need more time this negotiation has not come to a halt tonight and will be resumed tomorrow saturday
2358049 the expectation around the world is for a ceasefire for an end to use of russian aerial bombing missile attacks use of combat forces us ambassador zalmay khalilzad told reporters
2358050 show restraint and to refrain from any further acts of violence or force

2358144 the forum is not about conversion per se as the council endorses the absolute right of individuals to embrace islam
2358145 instead the forum will address the ancillary issues that arise from such situations and will emphasise the need for laws and a judicial system that protects everyone equally
2358146 it is the continued suppression of open and respectful discourse not public forums that will cause tension and jeopardise national unity
2358147 the association is one of several islamic non governmental organisations strongly opposed to the forum because it threatens the purity and pride of the religion of islam

2358201 in recent years companies from intel corp to centurytel inc collectively have moved hundreds of millions of dollars of obligations for executive benefits into rank and file pension plans this lets companies capture tax breaks intended for pensions of regular workers and use them to pay for executives supplemental benefits and compensation

2358261 biblical scholars in colorado springs have uncovered startling evidence that senator john mccain may be the antichrist
2358262 what started us looking at this issue is the fact that senator mccain has declared his intention to maintain us forces in iraq for a hundred years
2358263 that means that mccain wants to control babylon for at least a century
2358264 we believe that the end times is near based on the pattern of wars earthquakes and other strange phenomena weve been witnessing since the start of the new millennium
2358265 given that it may be imminent the person who controls babylon must be the antichrist
2358266 what clinched it for us was that the name mihai means who is like the lord
2358267 as far as were concerned that was enough it means that mccain might easily pretend to be the redeemer
2358268 many people think that the antichrist will be a evil seeming leader but in fact the bible tells us that he will be charming

2358282 while condemning the abuse of power and unjustified severity of the soviet regimes internal policies we nevertheless can neither treat indifferently attempts to equate communism and nazism nor agree that they were inspired by the same ideas and aims
2358283 in the 20th century the evils of soviet communism and nazi fascism were defeated and freedom spread around the world as new democracies emerged
2358284 such assessments simply feed the efforts of those who for political and selfish ends are striving to falsify the facts and rewrite history

2358295 miami steve even thou ricky weakestlink scored this is the 3rd time i have seen him run from second on a ball hit in front of him that is basic baseball he is so fin stupid
2358296 swaggaright gametight cc is on the mound you will need 1 3 uns to win hardy should have bunted him over so we can get atleast one run to start the game off nevermind wild pitch just made up for it
2358297 miami steve bt82 weakestlink has been making the exact same mistakes all year and they are not corrected yet the same mistakes on the basepaths the same mistakes in the batters box and the same mistakes in the field the same mistakes
2358298 get ready to send me thousands of dollars for playoff tickets
2358299 russell branyon plays terrible defense he should not play every day imo
2358300 you rickie bashers are like favre lovers you dont know anything else to say so you resort to the same things every game come up with something new for once it gets old reading it
2358301 macmcl14 branyan is no worse the hall but counsell is one of the best fielders there is
2358302 counsell is playing because of his glove career fielding 985 979 at 3b hall 170 games 3b 932 branyan 328 games 3b 946
2358303 counsell is playing because of his glove career fielding 985 979 at 3b
2358304 and if a basher doesnt understand the sport how come i know you dont run from second base on a ball hit in front of you but rick weaks does it every time
2358305 well sorry to ned yost but i think ill take branyans 3 lower fielding and keep his bat in the lineup he is a game changer whereas counsell is a routine out with occasional singles here and there
2358306 whatever sentence the court gives you it will never bring vivien back to life
2358307 i hope you will be more careful in future although the court sympathises with your condition that does not give you the right to take another mans life
2358308 he has two daughters who will be getting married in october and march next year
2358309 the whole incident was an accident he never meant to kill the victim
2358310 krishnan took the law into his own hands no doubt there was an argument but he did not have to resort to violence
2358311 this is not our culture he could have resorted to other ways
2358312 alege he took some type of drug a few days before the crash
2358313 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false
2358314 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2358315 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2358316 i want to see our party lead on the great moral issues yes me a democrat using that word the great moral issues that face our country
2358317 if we want to live in a moral honest just america and if we want to live in a moral and just world we cant wait for somebody else to do it we have to do it
2358318 when you look into a mirror do you like whats looking at you now that youve seen your true reflections what on earth are you gonna do
2358319 i actually walked the country to see who i am who i really am but i dont know what the result of that will be
2358320 but for me personally id rather be successful or unsuccessful based on who i really am not based on some plastic ken doll that you put up in front of audiences thats not me you know
2358321 this is our opportunity as a family within the store to pick somebody to help
2358322 these ones touch a little closer to home for us
2358323 i agree we should all be cautious with those kinds of allegations
2358324 the jury is not going to understand the case unless they understand the relationship between the defendant and ms hoffman
2358325 this is not irrelevant its going to be part of the case part of the proof
2358326 that one might argue that they constitute little more than outdoor zoo populations
2358327 cannot be expected to expend funds indefinitely to maintain condors in nature
2358328 progress toward recovery is not sustainable under current conditions because reintroduction of more condors simply increases the costs required to keep wild birds alive
2358329 an extensive outreach effort to rally support for replacement of lead ammunition
2358330 poisoning from ingestion of spent ammunition in carcasses is so severe and chronic
2358331 that condor recovery cannot be achieved so long as such lead exposure continues
2358332 removing lead ammunition is not only right for condors it is right for other scavengers and it is right for hunters and their families
2358333 may be highly problematic california fish and game has done little to educate hunters and non lead ammunition is not readily available or identifiable in many retail outlets
2358334 unlikely to comply as long as lead bullets are easily purchased
2358335 it is essential that hunters continue to harvest deer pigs and other wildlife throughout the condor range using non lead ammunition so that a clean source of wild food is available to condors beyond food subsidies

2358357 there are some summer steelhead coming up the river i heard of one report of a coho being caught but i think it was a summer steelhead that somebody misidentified
2358358 ive also heard theyve started hooking up with salmon fall chinook down in the bay i think with the little bit higher water weve got this year it should make the fishing a little bit better when the fall chinook get into the river
2358359 these are becoming close to safe democratic seats and republicans dont want to put the time and energy to go for the upset now
2358360 ecuador has the capacity to feed 80 million people and we only have 13 million people in other words there is land available to develop

2358367 while several newspapers including the los angeles times had been trying to pursue the story of edwards affair the sudden burst of attention friday after he confirmed the relationship with rielle hunter who produced documentaries for his campaign website was in marked contrast to the way news organizations had tiptoed around the original reports

2358386 u s headed toward bankruptcy says top budget committee republican
2358387 things really have deteriorated between john mccain and the press even the wall street journal editorial board is turning on him the famously conservative group publishes a column praising the economic policy of none other than barack obama the underreported economic news of the week is that barack obama favors a stronger dollar even better he thinks a stronger greenback would help to reduce oil prices
2358388 the ranking republican on the house budget committee said the u s government is headed toward bankruptcy
2358389 all the actuaries all the objective scorekeepers of the federal government are predicting this

2358392 8 boxes yesterday 9 boxes today girl im gonna smack you
2358393 has anyone ever told you youre like martha stewart on steroids or crack
2358394 i didnt know everybody was supposed to know especially when it wasnt a done deal and it wouldnt go down
2358395 its kind of between myself and my agent and boston and the padres
2358396 i dont think really anything needs to be said other than i made a commitment to play for this team for three or four years and at the end thats where i still stand
2358397 if youre a baseball fan this is the ultimate day
2358398 considering edmonds had two of their runs it was pretty hard to take but it took a cardinal to win the game for the cubs
2358399 a sox game and a cubs game in one day
2358400 its august 8th two of the most storied franchises in town sellouts in both stadiums both crowds are electric
2358401 baseball was the deciding factor for choosing the partys location
2358402 we knew that we wanted to go away from boston for the bachelor party this is a good excuse
2358403 its going to be a nightmare coming back to work on monday
2358404 that was a mistake not having taken that day off
2358405 for us its one of those deals where youre moving around the boards all the time were looking at our depth whos going to be where when and what its going to cost you
2358406 if we get in a situation where really economics doesnt play its not as if we have an unlimited amount of cash that we can do whatever we want to do were looking at everything we look at our pitching our bullpen infield outfield catching
2358407 i think the press does more to start trying to formulate what the market is
2358408 thats something we need to look at and fit in what were doing there are a lot of players wed like to have we feel fit on the ballclub
2358409 we cant pay everybody 18 to 20 million within reason we have proven we can be in the top five or six payrolls today but im not sure whats going to happen next year
2358410 and we feel comfortable with what were spending right now and well probably be spending that much next year
2358411 im one of those people if you make a decision you draw a line and move forward
2358412 we wouldnt make that move for teixeira unless we felt that we had enough strength in the organization to move forward
2358413 the shameful polluted olympics ioc and multi nationals complicit in subjecting world class athletes to world class pollution
2358414 thats usually what i try to do is just go out and throw strikes they were swinging well early and its always good to know that youve got a good hitting team behind you
2358415 if you keep them in the game theyre probably going to score some runs and we are going to win the game
2358416 losing is part of the game and its going to happen eventually
2358417 i just look forward to my next start i dont look back ive had some stretches where ive felt pretty good like this in my career but i wouldnt even know where this rates to be honest with you
2358418 that always helps anybody no matter how good theyre going we scored four in the first three innings and allowed him to take it from there
2358419 catcher jason kendall called a great game and i just followed him
2358420 hes working both sides of the plate keeping the ball down and using all his pitches any pitcher can have success if he does its as simple as that you have to try to simplify the game as much as possible
2358421 but if you give cc a couple of runs i know that i feel good im still always on guard when a situation is developing but he doesnt allow that very often
2358422 and when he does get into a tough situation its always a one or two run deal its never a four or five run deal
2358423 weve been taking advantage of situations getting runs here and there
2358424 we had two runs on home runs and the two out single by prince in the first inning to get us on the board was huge
2358425 especially with cc or benny sheets pitching to go into that second inning with a lead is always beneficial to your team
2358426 as a position player it really makes you step your game up because when you get a guy like that on the mound you dont want to waste it you want to make sure you give him everything you got so he can get the win because hes doing his part
2358427 and when you score early for sabathia its a wrap
2358428 its definitely nice to have our fans here being loud
2358429 theyve been loud ever since ive been here and it has been a lot of fun
2358430 ill probably throw the beginning of next week everything feels fine now
2358431 it would have been different if i wasnt still throwing 99 mph
2358432 it was a different feeling that i never had so i just wanted to make sure
2358433 im not going to speculate when hes going to come back just because i dont want to put any pressure on him
2358434 players think when they get hurt they can come back the next day but well be smart about it
2358435 in the coming days look for representatives of big media organizations to describe how aggressively they were reporting on the edwards story and how they were this close to having something to publish or broadcast when edwards short circuited the story by confessing to the hunter affair
2358436 although it doesnt look like much the motor produces an impressive 63 horsepower and 133 pound feet of torque
2358437 thats more horsepower than my 1969 vw beetle rss feed
2358438 its a great opportunity for them to be seen and theres always a kid that scouts dont know about that theyll find at an rbi workout
2358439 youre looking for arm strength and accuracy the grades that scouts look at are speed arm strength and accuracy the ability to field a ground ball the projectability of what theyre able to do in other words where are they at today and looking at their actions where could they be in the future
2358440 you want to go somewhere you just go here the experience is so fun here at rbi its like youre with your friends when you go to perfect game you dont know anyone
2358441 i think its a thing where the kids really feel tied into major league baseball with this
2358442 it kind of shows the commitment that major league baseball is behind this
2358443 people dont understand how important that is for you to be able to stand next to a major leaguer and go that guys bigger or that guys smaller than i thought and to be able to say i can do this
2358444 theres a certain confidence that comes with measuring yourself against a guy thats out there right now
2358445 this is one of those things you hope theres a lot of excitement because if you dont get excited about this kind of stuff then i dont know whats going to get you going
2358446 he was coming off a complete game and he picked right up where he left off
2358447 i think we all said before he was better than his record and i think hell continue to get better its nice we scored some runs for him
2358448 the guy is getting recognized as a legitimate top of the order rotation guy for any team in the big leagues
2358449 thats how i see jeremy guthrie and im glad a lot of other people are starting to recognize what hes all about hes for real
2358450 for the most part i think we worked down and thats what you have to do against this team
2358451 even ahead 7 1 you have to realize that they can have a big inning the slider was a good pitch and i didnt miss with it too often and thats the big key
2358452 you could see what they were doing to huff offspeed offspeed offspeed and millar came up there behind him and kind of equalized it
2358453 i dont have the ability just to go out there and see the ball react on breaking balls and hit them as far as josh hamilton ive got to really work and part of that is watching video and knowing the pitchers and seeing the tendencies
2358454 a lot of times when they got hits there was a lot of cheering which isnt going to happen normally
2358455 they swing at strikes and they dont go after a pitchers pitch so to shut this lineup down obviously its different without manny ramirez in there but to go out there and shut them down theyre one of the better hitting teams in the american league right now
2358456 we hit a lot of hard ground balls but thats what he wanted right to their guys
2358457 he was attacking the zone with nine pitches it seemed like he was tough man he was awesome tonight
2358458 i think he didnt hustle out of the batters box
2358459 i bet you anyone in the stands knows about it he hit the ball thought he hit a home run and pimped it all of a sudden he got caught in a rundown but it was a good thing it worked out for us a bad play turned out to be a good play
2358460 when i hit it and j d drew caught it i didnt know where it went
2358461 i thought it kicked away from him i looked up and the balls on its way to second i was like oh shoot im out i was trying to make something positive out of it
2358462 last year was so miserable i dont even remember what they did
2358463 playing the world champs going out there and getting the first win it should give us some confidence
2358464 its nice to win considering how bad they kicked our butts in this park last year
2358465 i think we got outscored like 80 4 in four games the bottom line is we have to take care of our own business we have to win games
2358466 it was hard trying to make people happy there it made for some long years
2358467 you look at somebody who comes up here for the first time
2358468 and take it a step further in that hes coming from another organization and he handled it well
2358469 it was great working with triple a pitching coach scott radinsky
2358470 and the pitching coach here carl willis is nice i see a lot of positives to it theres more communication here
2358471 i tried to throw strikes and not let that get to me
2358472 we put ourselves in a position to give him the opportunity
2358473 im excited to come in here with a chance to compete
2358474 chipper knows his body hes always given me honest answers and he says hes ready to go
2358475 i thought last year was bad when i was trying to stay above 500 now that doesnt seem that bad
2358476 you just have to get back to where you were
2358477 i just kind of had to rush myself to get ready for this year
2358478 but for me personally it felt good to battle against virtually the same lineup and have a totally different story this time
2358479 but i think the momentum of us starting to swing the bat replaced that i just rode the adrenaline really
2358480 if youre going to go out and give up a home run and thats going to bother you youre in the wrong game
2358481 i knew we were going to come back and get to their guy
2358482 he started to struggle a little bit and it was only a matter of time before we got in a groove
2358483 he couldnt have come into a more difficult situation than that
2358484 the last couple of months i dont think theres been a better player in baseball offensively but i think defensively too hes played just outstanding
2358485 thats the one thing i really concentrate on in the game every time i have people on base i dont try to do too much
2358486 i take what the game gives me im fortunate to have a lot of success in my career and i thank god ive been healthy thats the main thing stay healthy and be able to go out there every day and compete
2358487 once i hit the ball i thought for sure it was in the gap
2358488 when patterson dove for that ball i was like noooo but i tell you what when things are working out for you anything can happen
2358489 i was a little frustrated i gave up the lead for wolfie but the best thing i could do is keep them there and that was my goal after i blew the lead
2358490 keep them there and give us a chance to win the game
2358491 when sampsons down in the strike zone hes pretty good tonight i thought he made only one bad pitch and it ended up being a sac fly other than that he pitched very well
2358492 we stranded so many guys i think it was a dozen or so early on we stranded quite a few and even late too sometimes those things come back to bite you but tonight it didnt we got contributions from everyone really
2358493 its fun because you get so involved and so engulfed into what were doing here over the course of a major league season
2358494 its exciting for me to get excited about something else its something to follow sometimes the season keeps going on and you keep doing what youre doing for a couple of weeks ill have something else to get excited about and follow and i like that
2358495 the best thing to do is the internet and my parents will be over there and her husband ill get phone calls and updates
2358496 we dont get a lot of canadian softball coverage down here youll take what you can get
2358497 in athens they were playing at three four in the morning
2358498 id get up check the internet or id get a phone call waking me up and letting me know
2358499 we kind of just both played and did our thing and didnt really think anything else of it
2358500 we grew up thats what we did you look back now and think about whats happened and its pretty neat
2358501 it was usually one parent with one and the other with the other you adjust on the fly theyve been great about it they went to athens theyre over there now kind of getting to enjoy it one last time
2358502 they have a much better team this time so shes excited about the chances they have to medal
2358503 you want to win you want to come back with a medal and she said that this year the chances of that are much much greater im glad for that hopefully she brings the medal back
2358504 i was stressed out the last week ill be honest obviously his name had been up in the air a ton
2358505 hes great he said the guys have been unbelievable to him there jason is a chameleon he adapts to any surrounding at first i was worried and i tried to protect him but i know hes going to be just fine
2358506 hes pitched more big games than probably our entire staff put together
2358507 he has the ability to pitch innings a volume of innings hes got experience within the nl west division some success within the west division
2358508 as we explained to him we have put a lot of effort into this as he has
2358509 looking at it any other way but as a continued opportunity to continue pitching and making pitches i think would be exploring the wrong side of the map
2358510 its not in a bad spot last year on the outside was a lot worse this is good because its not in the joint
2358511 i go out there and play and wherever they put me im going to play
2358512 it has no bearing on me when i go up there and hit i just go up there and try to have good at bats and try to help this team win its not a bad spot to hit i dont try to hit home runs i just go up there and try to have a good at bat basically thats it just try to keep it simple
2358513 i like hitting down in the order four is always fun
2358514 five six three it doesnt matter when you hit first and second sometimes and youre not there on a steady basis it can be a little overwhelming for me if i get stuck in a spot and im there it becomes a routine over time its all good for me i like the routine more than anything
2358515 i have a hard time believing that edwards is being 51 honest even now let alone 99 or 100 honest
2358516 edwards denies being the father of rielles baby if true coff then while edwards was cheating on elizabeth rielle was cheating on him you just cant make this stuff up
2358517 cancer is enormously stressful both for its direct victims and their families while it is obviously easy to condemn edwards for cheating on his sick wife and putting his political party in great jeopardy and i normally delight in piling on with the rest of the righties this once i am going to refrain there are emotions here that we do not understand and can never understand and i lack the stomach to sit in judgment of them
2358518 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
2358519 by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
2358520 it was an unforgettable and moving ceremony that celebrated the imagination originality and energy of the beijing games
2358521 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china
2358522 you have to look like what you want to attract
2358523 my father trying to get more of them through me
2358524 interest in his work and his pronouncements fell off and though the russian people celebrated his return in 1994 the severity of his moral judgments about his homeland and about the west caused his influence to wane
2358525 dimmed after his repatriation and his diatribes on the denigration of his nation that were at times tainted with paranoia anti semitism and bigotry
2358526 has lost its civil courage both as a whole and separately in each country each government each political party and of course in the united nations such a decline in courage is particularly noticeable among the ruling groups and the intellectual elite causing an impression of loss of courage by the entire society
2358527 if the science were to be honestly used it would be
2358528 georgian forces are controlling the entire territory of south ossetia except java
2358529 this information will be checked but this is the approximate number based on information from relatives
2358530 the georgian side is right now firing on residential parts of tskhinvali
2358531 we responded to the last volley that hit tskhinvali and our peacekeepers positions with a counterstrike from our artillery and tanks
2358532 ambulances cannot move hospitals are reported to be overflowing surgery is taking place in corridors

2358541 choong hann will never be a complete player like lin dan and chong wei but what he will show in the olympics is that he has improved
2358542 the weak link in his game has always been his defence or rather the lack of it and this meant he always had to be in attacking mode
2358543 obviously he couldnt last and we realised that his defence had to be improved if he was to stand a chance in the olympics
2358544 i believe and so does choong hann that taufik can be beaten for one choong hann is in the best shape he has been in a long time while taufik is so unpredictable
2358545 he can be the best one day and just poor the next but we have to be prepared for both at the end of the day choong hann has to play well if he wants to win and this is exactly what he is ready to do
2358546 this i believe has to do with his physical condition as well as his improved defence choong hann believes he can do well in beijing and this has further strengthened him mentally
2358547 i used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it but being 99 honest is no longer enough i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices and i had hoped that it would never become public
2358548 tickets for barack obamas democratic national convention speech at the invesco field in denver sold out within 24 hours according to campaign officials in early july convention organizers announced the illinois senator would officially accept the democratic nomination at the 75 000 seat stadium rather than a 20 000 seat hall according to the colorado campaign for change the application process closed thursday afternoon after more than 60 000 seats were snatched up due to unprecedented demand the campaign has created a waitlist for coloradans hoping to get a chance to attend the august 28 event

2358551 the map is the most precise depiction yet of the limits and the future dividing lines that could be drawn across the arctic region
2358552 the results have huge implications for policy making as the rush to carve up the polar region continues
2358553 its a cartographic means of showing and an attempt to collate information and predict the way in which the arctic region may eventually be divided up
2358554 travelling for panorama i was reminded just how beautiful this country is and also how routinely trashed it is by people that litter and fly tip
2358555 studies show that its done by a very small proportion of people and of the people who litter high proportions can be persuaded to change their ways and thats what gives me hope
2358556 while the forecast is controversial and extremely bullish even allowing for some increase in capacity over the next few years a supply crunch appears likely around 2013
2358557 the implication is that it will quickly translate into a price spike although there is a question over how strategic stocks might be used to alleviate this

2358567 esperamos que sea una decisi n de estado y se sienten los 32 gobiernos federal estatal municipal y la ciudad de m xico no s lo para analizar el fen meno del secuestro sino decidan qu van a hacer y fijen tiempos s lo sobre ese problema
2358568 en un secuestro participan muchos actores de la sociedad el doctor que corta los dedos la ama de casa de casa que cuida al plagiado el due o de dos farmacias que echa aguas entre otros actores
2358569 es un buen principio en un pa s que parece que la ley est hecha para no respetarse
2358570 si queremos que esto ocurra que surjan cada vez m s empresas de vanguardia en nuestro pa s es fundamental incrementar la competitividad
2358571 con el objeto de que m xico se convierta como lo dice el presidente calder n en el mejor destino de inversi n en el mundo
2358572 y para eso el sector productivo requiere de un fortalecimiento tecnol gico urgente para la generaci n de conocimiento para que sea un factor primordial

2358578 creemos que se van a ir ajustando al alza por la expectativa de un incremento de 25 puntos base en la tasa del fondeo
2358579 garantizamos que las leyes fueron sometidas a an lisis y revisiones exhaustivas
2358580 s lo a una oposici n como la que tenemos en venezuela le puede dar verg enza que la fuerza armada nacional sea ahora bolivariana s lo a una oposici n como la que tenemos en venezuela le puede molestar que se otorgue m s poder al pueblo o se intente organizar el territorio nacional de forma m s equitativa
2358581 creo que en el nimo del presidente ch vez y la gente que le rodea hay una l gica de tipo revolucionaria en la cual ellos pasan por encima de las instituciones cuando les conviene porque quieren realizar cambios profundos
2358582 el tribunal supremo tom en contra de los ciudadanos la decisi n de tirar por la borda y darle una patada a la constituci n
2358583 la cuesti n de las inhabilitaciones demuestra que el consejo nacional electoral y el tribunal supremo de justicia est n tambi n alineados con esa l gica revolucionaria del gobierno

2358605 tiene que ser aqu y ahora si no hay este cambio en viena vamos a tener otra vez las cifras de que la prevenci n va atr s del contagio porque realmente el cambio que va a modificar la situaci n actual es el cambio en la cultura de la sexualidad a fondo
2358606 cuando uno lucha por los derechos cuando uno cree en las libertades uno no le grita a los ponentes ni interrumpe las clausuras

2358628 you want to know what true happiness is knowing your place being given a job you know you can do doing it as hard as you can and knowing youre good at it
2358629 really when youre in that position what you do becomes what you are you could be a doorstop but when someone asks you who the hell are you you can say my name is tony danza and im a motherfricken doorstop end of story not everybody can do that
2358630 well worry about tony danza if you want but the philosophy is sound if you know your own name and you know what youre good for you are nine tenths of the way to true happiness

2358632 i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness
2358633 you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself
2358634 i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2358635 edwards told abc news correspondent bob woodruff he did have an affair with 44 year old rielle hunter but said that he did not love her
2358636 i also have not been engaged in any activity of any description that requested agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby
2358637 oddly made somewhat easier after her diagnosis of breast cancer in march 2007
2358638 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognised my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness
2358639 although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public when a supermarket tabloid told a version of the story i used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it but being 99 per cent honest is no longer enough
2358640 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices and i had hoped that it would never become public with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly
2358641 but that misconduct took place for a short period in 2006
2358642 i also have not been engaged in any activity of any description that requested agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby
2358643 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
2358644 if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2358645 i have given a complete interview on this matter and having done so will have nothing more to say

2358657 the american association of franchisees and dealers announced today that it has suspended its recognition of cuppys coffee and more llc as an aafd accredited contract recipient pending a determination of the associations board of directors that aafds accreditation of the cuppys contract should be withdrawn
2358658 cuppys earned aafd accredited status in may of 2007 in an admitted effort to reinvent its corporate personal and arise from the ashes from legal and economic difficulties of its predecessor brand java joz as part of its commitment to collaborative franchising practices cuppys adopted a new franchise agreement that substantially complied with the aafds fair franchising standards and further agreed to support the formation of an independent franchisee association to collaborate with the development of a purchasing cooperative to be jointly owned by cuppys and its franchisees and to submit claims and disputes to mediation upon the request of any party
2358659 russia launched a blunt and open invasion of georgia and has challenged the international community and its established democracy
2358660 the united states is profoundly disturbed by this development and we call on russia to cease all attacks and respect georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
2358661 my government supports a ceasefire under international mediation and we seek russias support for the ceasefire
2358662 but then the jewish leaders came to me and said
2358663 how terrible that you should boast about your spirituality and yet you let this sort of thing go on
2358664 one will always be a student of the torah never its master
2358665 dont you realize that if even one person is allowed to go on sinning soon all will be affected
2358666 it isnt my responsibility to judge outsiders but it certainly is your job to judge those inside the church who are sinning in these ways
2358667 what i meant was that you are not to associate with anyone who claims to be a christian yet indulges in sexual sin or is greedy or worships idols or is abusive or a drunkard or a swindler
2358668 o lord i have come to you for protection dont let me be put to shame rescue me for you always do what is right
2358669 people may think they are doing what is right but the lord examines the heart
2358670 how terrible that you should boast about your spirituality and yet you let this sort of thing go on
2358671 look how loving we are we are accepting this brother just as he is look how open minded we are
2358672 while christians are not to judge one anothers motives or ministries we are certainly expected to be honest about each others conduct
2358673 you will never be the master of the torah gods word only the student
2358674 rescue me from my enemies hashem god of mercy i hid my plight from all but you
2358675 the psalmist says that despite all his tribulations he keeps his troubles hidden from everyone because no human beings can help him only to god does he pour out his heart
2358676 david immersed his soul in divine love and concealed himself in the almighty this positive attitude is expressed by king solomon proverbs 10 12 and love covers over all sins
2358677 confess your sins weaknesses faults one to another so that you may be healed
2358678 the manifestation of the spirit is given for the common good
2358679 where two or more are gathered in my name there i am in the mdist of them
2358680 immerse my soul in divine love and conceal myself in the almighty
2358681 o my god i am too ashamed and humiliated to lift up my face to you my god for our iniquities have risen higher than our heads and our guilt has grown up to the heavens
2358682 thereby declare that they put faith in the expiatory death of christ for the pardon of their past sins therefore paul likens baptism to a burial by which the former sinfulness is buried i e utterly taken away
2358683 every way of a man is right in his own eyes but the lord weighs the hearts
2358684 the hand of our god is upon all those for good who seek him but his power and his wrath are against all those who forsake him
2358685 and the hand of our god was upon us and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy and from ambush along the road
2358686 for you are my rock and my fortress therefore for your names sake lead me and guide me pull me out of the net which they have secretly laid for me for you are my strength

2358689 weve lived here 30 years and never have i ever seen a bear
2358690 and when i looked a bear looked right back at me through the sliding glass door he just sort of stumbled around the porch a minute and went out the other porch door
2358691 then the bear jumped out of the pool aggressively and started coming at us
2358692 i threw my wife on top of my truck and then he took off running across my buddys patio and went into the woods
2358693 so i guess theyre waiting for someone to get mauled before they do anything

2358695 really i mean i get that theres some verification you can do on a signature and if you want me to write out a clean deposit form thats cool too but initials
2358696 the ineffable joy that can be had in pursuing the absurd
2358697 my head was so full of words that i often had trouble forming simple sentences out loud
2358698 and my speech became a curious jumble of obscure words and improper syntax
2358699 some days i feel as if i do not actually speak the english language
2358700 like trying to remember all the trees one sees through the window of a train
2358701 i find myself wondering why ive never seen this odd term that describes such a common article of clothing

2358719 we are evaluating internal and external candidates for the role and both blitz the league ii and mortal kombat vs dc universe as well as other projects in the chicago studio are on track for successful launches
2358720 weve been battling every night trying to win ballgames and hopefully we can keep playing that way there are a lot more games left
2358721 that was a shot in the arm for us as a club and me personally
2358722 it was against the same lineup virtually and a totally different outcome this time i started to get a little gassed near the end but the momentum of us swinging the bat and holding the lead replaced that i rode the adrenaline really
2358723 he was so sick in boston he looked very skinny very bad but he battled and did what he needed to do
2358724 i was trying not to do too much thinking about right field and not pulling the ball because rogers throws a lot of offspeed stuff
2358725 i knew i was getting a good pitch to hit
2358726 they are better prepared and more confident than they have ever been
2358727 mentality of winning is important i want them to play with the highest caliber and to play each match as if it were the final
2358728 if you want to win the gold the draw means nothing to you as you have to beat every rival
2358729 our shuttlers enjoy better shape than the previous time and a pleasant feeling since they are competing on home courts
2358730 we have met twice and i lost both matches i dont feel much pressure i will do my best
2358731 we are good enough to win the gold medal and i am totally focused on ensuring pakistan does well in beijing
2358732 this is the story everybody is following to see if we can do it

2358975 john mccain was 42 she cindy was 24 during the next nine months he would fly to arizona or she would come to the washington area where mccain and carol had a home
2358976 mccain did not sue his wife for divorce until feb
2358977 mccain obtained an arizona marriage license on march 6 1980 while still legally married to his first wife
2358978 so youre saying mccain didnt really cheat on his wife and his wife was ok with it
2358979 these three have been usage items for many years all are standard and have long been so different to is limited to british english however but only different from seems never to meet objections she is different from her mother in many ways he feels different from the way he did yesterday you look different from him different than has been much criticized by commentators but is nonetheless standard at most levels except for some edited english consider she looks different than she did yesterday hes different than me some additional purist discomfort may arise here you look different than he him the problem lies in the assumption that than should be only a subordinating conjunction requiring the pronouns that follow to be the nominative case subjects of their clauses and not a preposition requiring the pronouns that follow to be the objective case objects of the preposition but standard english does use than as both preposition and conjunction she looks different than me is standard and so is she looks different than i do and with comparative forms of adjectives than occurs with great frequency she looks taller older better thinner etc than me than i do still best advice for formal and oratorical levels stick with different from
2358980 now sure just about all of our politicians lie and cheat even if they arent having affairs but once there is proof of an affair then there can be no pretense of honesty
2358981 john edwards cheats on his wife then lies about it
2358982 oh my gosh how did he do that did he really do that

2359006 we have volunteers all across the islands everywhere we went people were getting involved and coming out and they were volunteering and knocking doors and making phone calls and when the caucuses finally came we had more people caucusing than we had ever seen caucus in hawaii before
2359007 changing the paragraph as i gave you earlier makes the most sense
2359008 and the background would change too because relative urls dont work with custom css
2359009 i see all kinds of stuff in your blog that are extraneous html codes added by it
2359010 your post has a lot of garbage html in it from word
2359011 you have a lot of formatting in separate posts as you said because sometimes the formatting you wanted worked and sometimes it didnt
2359012 this you will have to clean up manually if you want your blog to be consistent well get back to that when weve got the css happening but keep that in mind

2359016 there is no escaping it everybody is in the breaking news business now
2359017 in a world of blogs and youtube that becomes impossible
2359018 there is an opportunity for the press to help readers visitors and listeners to handle the fire hose of information
2359019 the challenge for us is measuring ourselves against the reaction of news junkies and thats a shrinking category
2359020 with shrinking budgets at newspapers and television stations news executives are experimenting with new models for investigative journalism some are enlisting graduate and undergraduate students others are considering joint projects with media competitors and still others are exploring a nonprofit model these symbiotic relationships are transforming the media landscape changing not only the way investigations get done but who does them
2359021 tonight the hawks organization received an offer sheet from the memphis grizzlies for josh smith

2359029 we lost by 28 points in the first game against puerto rico in 2004 and it did more than just get your attention it blew us all away
2359030 it was like a big red light out there flashing
2359031 hes the only gold medalist on our team hes someone our young players look up to and because of his experience and leadership we felt he had a role
2359032 i just try to share my experience of 2000 because we havent had the success weve wanted the last couple of years
2359033 the worlds gotten better at the game of basketball we all understand that so were ready for the challenge
2359034 you can put the best players together but we all understand that we dont need kobe to score 30 we dont need lebron to score 30 we just need to be a team and play for that extra pass and when you look at the point guard situation in chris and deron we have that leadership that we didnt have in 04

2359044 at the day military news is local news because of the sub base the coast guard academy electric boat and the coast guard research and development headquarters
2359045 the paper has a long history of distinguished military affairs reporting because so much of our region is tied to national defense
2359046 this time a reporter and photographer will spend 10 days at camp bucca the fastest growing prison camp in iraq
2359047 bucca has many of the prisoners from abu ghraib and is gathering new residents daily as us and iraqi forces capture insurgents
2359048 you might call us web 3 0 because we want to combine expert media with a social filter
2359049 we are trying to do real journalism so we dont want to be in a local non profit that were going to cover
2359050 well have certain programs aimed at high school kids and some at a general audience
2359051 my way of dealing with it this time is with multiple streams but we are going to try to start a co op a consumer and producer co op
2359052 however they might be interested in buying shares in a co operative business because they just believe in it its a better way of doing something
2359053 is people who define themselves as left of the democratic leadership
2359054 its going to be in the orchards and its going to bear some wonderful fruit
2359055 when i was in australia they had a placenta tree that was on the river and all the placentas of all that tribe all that clan whatever aboriginal tribe that was all the placentas went under that one tree and it was this huge behemoth of just health and strength

2359063 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
2359064 everytime i say aids is a black disease it irks everyone
2359065 whites call me racist and blacks say you have stigmatized us
2359066 whats more disturbing is there are so many people more concerned about what other people think of us than whether we survive or not
2359067 to give evidence of what she know s relating to said action
2359068 fennimores testimony would be needed because her written accounts of witness testimony are at odds with other testimony those witnesses gave
2359069 self authenticating so that witnesses can be cross examined based on the articles themselves
2359070 we tried to find academic work and individuals who had studied these issues outside these two sources and then met with a number of the individuals in the industry
2359071 i dont think were doing an adequate job right now in connecticut
2359072 where the rules may not be as well defined and where the relationships may not be of the same kind that we have with the mohegans and the mashantucket pequots
2359073 i dont know why we are so afraid to look at this
2359074 i think it should be a duty of the goverment to monitor the impacts of gambling
2359075 i have not had a single call from the state of massachusetts
2359076 the big gamble the costs benefits and coverage of casinos
2359077 my arm feels good so obviously i took the right path
2359078 i wish it went a little quicker but we did what we needed to do and my arm feels good so im back and ready to play
2359079 my mechanics were all messed up and i couldnt throw where i wanted to i wanted it to go away to the point where it didnt hurt but i wasnt able to do it thats why we took the step to go back to the dl

2359082 weve missed a little bit on qualifying hopefully it looks like the car is pretty strong this week
2359083 at the 2007 world championships i did seven events my training has gone very well im getting excited its been a very long training camp were excited to get this going
2359084 the one im looking forward to the most is the 100 back
2359085 thats my pet event i feel the targets the largest in that event
2359086 theres a lot of fast freestylers out there im just looking to get on the podium any way i can i have no expectations for the 200 im
2359087 i have a lot of goals going into beijing but im keeping them to myself
2359088 there are other teams just as strong we have to do our best when it matters people get so focused on the americans and the australians they forget other teams are out there
2359089 i was only 15 at the athens olympics and now i am 19 i feel i have improved a lot both mentally as well as the skills of my game
2359090 i want to apply what i learnt at the athens games to the beijing games
2359091 i dont know well see tomorrow i feel real good
2359092 hes performed well for a long period of time it just so happens that all the games are big games and he does seem to rise to that
2359093 when hes throwing that thing at 95 mph and theyll mess around every now and then and throw a changeup a lollipop or something ollies just having fun he had tremendous life on his fastball tonight
2359094 to throw the ball the way he did and take the ball in the seventh inning the way that pitch count was great pitches
2359095 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2359096 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2359097 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2359098 screws fall out all the time the world is an imperfect place
2359099 he was having an all star type year when he got hurt
2359100 getting him back would be a great lift for us
2359101 i felt real good today i was getting on top of the fastball all day
2359102 in warmups i was throwing my slider i knew i had to stay closed i was opening up too quick in previous games but i felt a lot better today
2359103 they didnt mention anything to me everyone was still giving me high fives
2359104 we talked just like normal we kept everything ordinary i didnt do anything odd
2359105 i told him keep your head up man you did your job right there
2359106 i didnt think it was hit that far i thought it would be an easy play
2359107 thats the loudest ive heard anybody cheer when parker made that catch it gave me goose bumps
2359108 i wasnt nearly as tired as i thought id be
2359109 and leaving mike aviles in the leadoff spot just seemed to be the natural thing to do because hes been so successful and it doesnt seem to affect david no matter where we hit him in the top three spots
2359110 id like to be back in september and help the team out
2359111 hospital patients are now being treated for a new disorder called global warming delusion
2359112 doctors say patients can fight this by concentrating on more realistic dangers like space aliens and bigfoot
2359113 its easy to play and doesnt take a lick of practice there arent any rules and you neednt even include the people whom youre judging into the action all you need to do is fully subscribe to some notion of what a marriage relationship partnership is
2359114 in this context was centered in that we didnt fight with or complain about each other
2359115 when we started the company we thought we were going to only attract eccentrics
2359116 but i think everybody is on the eccentric side they want to make their home unique
2359117 absolutely none my builders eyes rolled back in his head when i told him i wanted a secret room what can i say i watched too many disney movies when i was a boy
2359118 character is like a tree and reputation like a shadow the shadow is what we think of it the tree is the real thing
2359119 attorneys with the alliance defense fund and protectmarriage com say they intend to file the appeal immediately
2359120 well you can say that im the one curly fry in the box of the regular
2359121 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2359122 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2359123 his name could best be described as the shape of a dna strand multiplied by something that smelled like meat burning
2359124 you want girly books theyre in the back you gotta go down that aisle of superhero books to get there see the superhero books those right there the marvel ones with the pretty colors and spider man stories you ever read any of those why dont you try one of those
2359125 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2359126 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2359127 dont take this the wrong way but if youre starting out in comics why would you do a superhero story the superhero audience is already being well served by marvel and dc so that audience really isnt going to care about your characters or situations so thats a non starter and marvel and dc arent going to hire you because even if your comic is the best superhero comic ever well theyve already got their comics scheduled out for a while and best of luck etc
2359128 person 1 s gadget guy story is the official continuity

2359133 man i would like to be the one carrying that flag
2359134 thats what our country is built on survival and fighting he was the best ambassador to carry the flag and represent the united states
2359135 when it comes down to it politics and athletics dont mix and everybody in that room was an athlete nobody was a politician his nomination to bear the flag came from the purest of decisions

2359145 a nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master and deserves one
2359146 its kind of like ive been given a clean piece of paper a clean slate
2359147 it was really neat just getting in the car at the hospital knowing i was going home
2359148 i would like to have him involved he is too good a resource not to
2359149 hey dad since were going to see superman and its an all star tournament we can call it all star superman like the comic
2359150 hinge on the use of fingerprinting a fairly revolutionary idea at the time
2359151 im open to play at least a little bit this year i mean i think thats everybodys goal to play
2359152 im hoping to play somewhere this year right now im just doing my thing with the team and hoping to play a little bit at the end of the season
2359153 i felt great i mean everything feels great im having no problems moving around
2359154 the main thing in rehab is to get to spring training at 100 percent
2359155 a lot of it is mind over matter and hopefully everything keeps going well i have to take everything day to day and attack each goal individually
2359156 ive been very fortunate to this day and im going to continue to take it one day at a time
2359157 no one has given me a timetable so im going to keep at it and hope for the best
2359158 i had a rough month of july so ive been looking to get back on track and try to end the season on a positive note
2359159 i was making some quality pitches consistently throwing good strikes with my fastball
2359160 the umpire made me feel pretty comfortable with the way he expanded the zone
2359161 i dont think it was necessarily fatigue it was a little bit of nerves
2359162 tonight was a pretty peculiar game a lot of times they were getting into fastball counts but they were taking defensive swings maybe it was because i was able to throw some quality breaking balls in those counts
2359163 jake fox is hot right now and hes a good hitter
2359164 i thought if i got past him id have a chance to do it
2359165 i was sitting there kind of replaying some things in my mind
2359166 i snapped back to reality when the bases got full
2359167 the main thing is you cant sit there on dwell on the perfect game because we have to focus on winning the game
2359168 but how do you know its not a white bike with red lights shining on it
2359169 because its a red bike and red bikes cant also be white
2359170 absent are the dramatic screeches and cries of television sitcom labor this is the sound of someone exploring their limits this is the sound of someones life changing
2359171 the woman moans through each contraction and you feel a tug deep inside of you an urge an awakening that you never knew was there before
2359172 i gave a 3 hour heart felt interview and what became of it was quotes that were usually about something else entirely in the conversation grossly simplified and taken way out of context and sprinkled randomly and erroneously throughout the 2 pages sic
2359173 if you want it magazine for the photos then great but i am not behind the article at all
2359174 they really could have ran with it baby news but they said they would not
2359175 um excuse me i was just reading your blog today and did i read things correctly
2359176 oh crap did i forget to tell you that im engaged
2359177 love consists in this that two solitudes protect and border and greet each other
2359178 i said yes lets do it but you have never made a game we have to have experienced people do it so it took a while recruiting one person at a time and because fumito ueda doesnt compromise we had to move the development from psone to playstation 2 then i couldnt complete the game because i moved to the united states
2359179 it took four years and the second game took four years too so i started calling them the olympic team they havent released a ps3 title yet of course not theyll take four years but they have something really really good on the way
2359180 i think it would have complicated what were trying to do
2359181 i think we would have been accused and rightfully so of not getting off our addiction to the strategy that worked for so many years but then didnt work and that we were slow to recognize didnt work
2359182 we would have continued our addiction to it without bonds that i think would have been a mistake we probably wouldnt have aaron rowand if that had happened we still had randy winn freddie lewis wouldnt be starting wed have a great hitter to me mannys been the best hitter in the american league the last 15 years or so he still would have been on a club in my opinion that wasnt going to win 90 games
2359183 im sure he feels he didnt leave under circumstances that he felt he deserved
2359184 i understand that he would say with all i did for this franchise i should be allowed to go out on my own terms yes we felt we had to go in a different direction i tried to tell him why we had to do that i think he understood the logic of it but i think he just didnt want to hear that
2359185 listened to the first sentence said without a sense of hyberbole clicked away dawkins is insufferable
2359186 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed
2359187 would rather read authors like stephen jay gould who present their subject with enthusiasm and an isnt this fascinating tone

2359189 pui de napirci cine v a invatat sa fugiti de minia viitoare
2359190 de unde vine daca i membru in vre o denominatiune daca semneaza vre o cerere de adeziune la vre o sinagoga sau daca l cunoaste cineva si poate da referinte despre el si el totusi a propovaduit cuvintul domnului prin el domnul a facut minuni vindecari si invieri din morti
2359191 cind a vazut simon ca duhul sfint era dat prin punerea miinilor apostolilor le a dat bani si a zis dati mi si mie puterea aceasta pentru ca peste orcine mi voi pune miinile sa primeasca duh sfint dar petru i a zis banii tai sa piara cu tine pentru ca ai crezut ca darul lui dumnezeu s ar capata cu bani tu n ai nici parte nici sort in toata treba aceasta caci inima ta nu este curata inaintea lui dumnezeu
2359192 iata ca v am dat putere sa calcati peste serpi si peste scorpii si peste toata puterea vrasmasului si nimic nu va va putea vatama
2359193 adevarat adevarat ca spun ca cine crede in mine va face si el lucrarile pe care le fac eu ba inca va face altele si mai mari decit acestea pentru ca eu ma duc la tatal si orice veti cere in numele meu voi face pentru ca tatal sa fie proslavit in fiul daca veti cere ceva in numele meu voi face
2359194 tot ce veti cere cu credinta prin rugaciune veti primi
2359195 iata semnele care vor insoti pe cei care vor crede in numele meu vor scoate draci vor vorbi in limbi noi vor lua in mina serpi daca vor bea ceva de moarte nu i va vatama isi vor pune miinile peste bolnavi si bolnavii se vor insanatosa
2359196 cereti si veti primi cereti si veti capata cereti si eu voi face
2359197 ascultati bine ce va spun cind va fi printre voi un prooroc eu domnul ma voi descoperi lui intr o vedenie sau ii voi vorbi intr un vis nu tot asa este insa cu robul meu moise el este credincios in toata casa mea eu ii vorbesc gura catre gura ma descopar lui nu prin lucruri greu de inteles ci el vede chipul domnului
2359198 cind a ispravit domnul de vorbit cu moise pe muntele sinai i a dat cele doua table ale marturiei table din piatra scrise cu degetul domnului
2359199 tablele erau lucrarea lui dumnezeu si scrisul era scrisul lui dumnezeu sapat pe table
2359200 domnul vorbea cu moise fata in fata cum vorbeste un om cu prietenul lui
2359201 si domnul mi a dat cele doua table de piatra scrise cu degetul lui
2359202 moise s a pogorit de pe muntele sinai cu cele doua table ale marturiei in mina cind se pogora nu stia ca pielea fetei lui stralucea aaron si toti copiii lui israel s au uitat la moise si iata ca pielea fetei lui stralucea
2359203 fii lui israel nu puteau sa si pironeasca ochii asupra fetei lui moise din pricina stralucirii fetei lui
2359204 caci domnul este duhul si unde este duhul domnului acolo este slobozenia
2359205 dupa sase zile isus a luat cu el pe petru iacov si ioan fratele lui si i a dus la o parte pe un munte inalt el s a schimbat la fata inaintea lor fata lui stralucea ca soarele si hainele i s au facut albe ca lumina si iata ca li s a aratat moise si ilie stind de vorba cu el petru a luat cuvintul si a zis lui isus doamne este bine sa fim aici daca vrei am sa fac aici trei colibi una pentru tine una pentru moise si una pentru ilie pe cind vorbea el inca iata ca i a acoperit un nor luminos cu umbra lui si din nor s a auzit un glas care zicea acesta este fiul meu preaiubit in care imi gasesc toata placerea mea de el sa ascultati
2359206 caci mostenirea daca ar veni din lege nu mai vine din fagaduinta daca s ar fi dat o lege care sa poata da viata intradevar neprihanira ar veni din lege legea ne a fost un indrumator spre hristos ca sa fim socotiti neprihaniti prin credinta dupa ce a venit credinta nu mai sintem sub indrumatorul acestea caci toti sinteti fii ai lui dumnezeu prin credinta in hristos isus si daca sinteti ai lui hristos sinteti saminta lui avraam mostenitori prin fagaduinta
2359207 avraam si a ridicat ochii si s a uitat si iata ca trei barbatii stateau in picioare linga el
2359208 cei doi ingeri au ajuns la sodoma seara si lot sedea la poarta sodomei cind i a vazut lot s a sculat le a iesit inainte si s a aplecat pina la pamint apoi a zis domnii mei intrati va rog geneza 19 1 2
2359209 unde sint oamenii care au intrat la tine in noapte asta
2359210 ma rog ca toti sa fie una cum tu tata esti in mine si eu in tine eu in ei si tu in mine tata vreau ca acolo unde sint eu sa fie impreuna cu mine si aceia pe care mi i ai dat tu pentru ca dragostea cu care m ai iubit tu sa fie in ei si eu sa fiu in ei
2359211 isus le a vorbit din nou si a zis eu sint lumina lumii cine ma urmeaza pe mine nu va umbla in intuneric ci va avea lumina vietii
2359212 adevarat adevarat va spun ca daca nu mincati trupul fiului omului si daca nu beti singele lui n aveti viata in voi insiva cine maninca trupul meu are viata vesnica si eu il voi invia in ziua de apoi caci trupul meu este cu adevarat o hrana si singele meu este cu adevarat o bautura cine maninca trupul meu si bea singele meu ramine in mine si eu ramin in el
2359213 lucrarile pe care le face el le vom face si noi chiar mai mari decit acestea
2359214 s a inaltat la cer si a sezut la derapta lui dumnezeu
2359215 cel ce m a trimes este cu mine tatal nu m a lasat singur pentru ca totdeauna fac ce i este placut
2359216 nu crezi ca eu sint in tatal si tatal este in mine cuvintele pe care vi le spun eu nu le spun de la mine ci tatal care locuieste in mine el face aceste lucrari ale lui
2359217 ma duc la tatal caci tatal este mai mare decit mine
2359218 mincarea mea este sa fac voia celui ce m a trimis si sa implinesc lucrarea lui
2359219 m am pogorit din cer ca sa fac nu voia mea ci voia celui ce m a trimes
2359220 eu nu pot face nimic de la mine insumi pentru ca nu caut sa fac voia mea ci voia tatalui care m a trimes
2359221 lucrarile pe care mi le a dat tatal sa le savirsesc acestea marturisesc despre mine ca tatal m a trimes
2359222 dupa cum tatal care este viu m a trimis pe mine si eu traiesc prin tatal
2359223 adevarat adevarat va spun ca fiul nu poate face nimic de la sine el nu face decit ce vede pe tatal facind si tot ce face tatal face si fiul intocmai
2359224 caci eu n am vorbit de la mine insami ci tatal care m a trimes el insusi mi a poruncit ce trebuie sa spun si cum trebuie sa vorbesc
2359225 cuvintul meu care iese din gura mea nu se intoarce la mine fara rod ci va face voia mea si va implini planurile mele
2359226 apoi a zis sutasului du te si faca ti se dupa credinta ta si robul lui s a tamaduit chiar in ceasul acela
2359227 cind s au intors acasa trimisii au gasit sanatos pe robul care fusese bolnav
2359228 a apucat o de mina si a strigat cu glas tare fetito scoala te
2359229 marta a zis lui isus doamne daca ai fi fost aici n ar fi murit fratele meu dar si acum stiu ca orice vei cere de la dumnezeu iti va da dumnezeu isus i a zis fratele tau va invia stiu i a raspuns marta ca va invia la invire in ziua de apoi isus i a zis eu sint invierea si viata cine crede in mine chiar daca ar fi murit va trai si oricine traieste si crede in mine nu va muri niciodata da doamne i a zis ea cred ca tu esti hristosul fiul lui dumnezeu care trebuia sa vina in lume
2359230 cind a vazut o isus a chemat o si i a zis femeie esti dezlegata de neputinta ta si a intins miinile peste ea indata s a indreptat si slavea pe dumnezeu
2359231 zachee da te jos degraba din dud caci astazi trebuie sa ramin in casa ta zacheu l a primit cu bucurie isus i a zis astazi a intrat mintuirea in casa aceasta pentru ca fiul omnului a venit sa caute si sa mintuiasca ce era pierdut
2359232 iar saminta cazuta in pamint bun este cel ce aude cuvintul si l intelge el aduce roada
2359233 tarina este lumea saminta buna sint fiii imparatiei neghina sint fiii celui rau
2359234 cu imparatia lui dumnezeu este ca atunci cind arunca un om saminta in pamint fie ca doarme noaptea fie ca sta treaz ziua saminta incolteste si creste pamintul rodeste singur intii un fir vrede apoi spic dupa acea griul deplin in spic si cind este coapta roada pune indata secera in ea pentru ca a venit secerisul
2359235 apoi m am uitat si pe nor sedea cineva care semana cu un fiu al omului pe cap avea o cununa de aur iar in mina o secera ascutita si un alt inger striga cu glas tare celui ce sade pe nor pune secera ta si secera pentu ca a venit ceasul sa seceri si secerisul pamintului este copt atunci cel ce sedea pe nor si a aruncat secera pe pamint si pamintul a fost secerat
2359236 citi in hristos s au botezat in hristos s au si mbracat
2359237 atunci se va vedea fiul omului venind pe norii cerului cu mare putere si cu slava
2359238 si a zis ucenicilor vor veni zile cind veti dori sa vedeti una din zilele fiului omului si n o veti vedea vi se va zice iata l aici iata l acolo sa nu va duce ti nici sa i urmati caci cum iese fulgerul si lumineaza de la o margine a cerului pina la cealalta asa va fi si cu fiul omului in ziua sa
2359239 imparatia lui dumnezeu nu vine in asa fel ca sa izbeasca privirile
2359240 nu se va zice uite o aici sau uite o acolo caci iata ca imparatia lui dumnezeu este chiar inlauntrul vostru
2359241 pentru ca atunci va fi un necaz asa de mare cum n a fost niciodata de la inceputul lumii pina acum si nici nu va mai fi si daca zilele acelea n ar fi fost scurtate nimeni n ar scapa dar din pricina celor alesi zilele acelea vor fi scurtate atunci daca va va spune cinva iata hristosul este aici sau acolo sa nu l credeti caci se vor scula hristosi mincinosi si prooroci mincinosi vor face semne mari si minuni pina acolo incit sa insele daca va fi cu putinta chiar si pe cei alesi
2359242 se vor scula din mijlocul vostru oameni care vor invata lucruri stricacioase
2359243 avem la tatal un mijlocitor pe isus hristos cel neprihanit 1ioan 2 1
2359244 caci este un singur dumnezeu si este un singur mijlocitor intre dumnezeu si oameni omul isus hristos
2359245 eu sint adevarata vita de vie si tatal meu este vierul pe orice mladita care este in mine si n aduce roada el o taie si pe orice mladita care aduce roada o curateste ca sa aduca si mai multa roada ramineti in mine si eu voi raminea in voi dupa cum mladita nu poate aduce roada de la sine daca nu ramine in vita tot asa nici voi nu puteti aduce roada daca nu ramineti in mine eu sint vita voi sinteti mladitele cine ramine in mine si in cine ramin eu aduce multa roada caci desprtiti de mine nu puteti face nimic
2359246 cine a cunoscut bratul domnului el a crescut inaintea lui ca o odrasla slaba ca un lastar care iese dintr un pamint uscat
2359247 domnul isi descopera bratul sau cel sfint inaintea tuturor neamurilor isaia 52 10
2359248 ei bine prin niste oameni cu buze bilbiitoare si cu vorbirea straina va vorbi poporului acestuia domnul
2359249 in lege este scris voi vorbi norodului acestuia prin alta limba si prin buze straine si nici asa nu ma vor asculta zice domnul
2359250 eu am zis sinteti dumnezei toti sinteti fiii ai celui prea inalt
2359251 oile mele asculta glasul meu eu le cunosc si ele vin dupa mine eu le dau viata vesnica in veac nu vor pieri si nimeni nu le va smulge din mina mea tatal meu care mi le a dat este mai mare decit toti si nimeni nu le poate smulge din mina tatalui meu eu si tatal una sintem
2359252 isus a zis eu sint invierea si viata cine crede in mine chiar daca ar fi murit va trai
2359253 cind va veni mingiietorul duhul adevarului are sa va calaluzeasca in tot adevarul si va va descoperi lucrurile viitoare el ma va proslavi pentru ca va lua din ce este al meu si va va descoperi tot ce are tatal este al meu de aceea am zis ca va lua din ce este al meu si va va descoperi
2359254 pocaitiva caci imparatia cerurilor este aproape pregatiti calea domnului neteziti i cararile vremea s a implinit pocaiti va si credeti in evanghelie
2359255 our offence has been doing a great job driving the ball down the field and putting it in the end zone and those times that we dont get into the end zone its my job to come out and put it through the uprights
2359256 im definitely feeling good and i just have to continue doing it every week
2359257 everybody knows how the cfl works the flip flops the first half of the season and the second half of the season teams get hot and you want to be in first place
2359258 to be in first place says a lot because everybody talent wise theres a lot of parity
2359259 thats the great balance of our team theres a lot of weapons
2359260 there would always be one play that we dont make and weve got to make that play to keep the drive going
2359261 like ryan expressed some guys are playing good some arent
2359262 in this sport as everybody knows its not a one man show its the team the team has to win and were not getting a team effort right now
2359263 but im very excited about being near the lead i want to see how i handle it
2359264 the greens are dead theyre seriously dying its not a complaint but theyre on the edge of bye bye
2359265 reveal there is sufficient ridership to sustain a permanent extended schedule
2359266 he swam a fair way out he was 250m out to sea at one point and he was out there for a long time
2359267 it was very fortunate he didnt drown it was very cold
2359268 said shama 22 a marine corps veteran who served in ramadi iraq and is now an intern at the jerusalem funds palestine center in washington d c hes working toward a degree in international relations with the dream of working in the u s state department office of middle eastern affairs
2359269 when it comes to the quran im sure it says youre not supposed to wage war against others of the same religion
2359270 in ramadi iraq we were fighting al qaeda and al qaeda every day in the news at the time they were blowing up a mosque killing muslims and women and children to me i wasnt fighting against muslims i was fighting against extremists who had taken the religion
2359271 there were times we were going in places where instead of it having to be an ugly situation where marines dont speak arabic telling them to move from room to room instead i could speak to them
2359272 by the end of the day we were sitting there sipping tea with the iraqis in the house everybody is relaxing talking
2359273 i can never complain about being arabic and being in the military
2359274 because of the way my leaders have treated me i have nothing to complain about if anything being arab and being muslim in the military right now benefits a unit so much if anything it helps your career
2359275 and he said arabic people in arabic towns here will never accept you for that it doesnt piss you off it makes you sad because i know what i did in ramadi and the number of iraqi children who got sent to us and the police who got sent to the hospital who we helped save
2359276 well you can say that im the one curly fry in the box of the regular
2359277 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2359278 well i do it for you actually everything i do is for you
2359279 whats the rush we are just enjoying the time we have now together and when that time comes we will let you know
2359280 when a team is on a bad roll as were the as you want to keep them down
2359281 not sure my role long term is as a closer
2359282 but ill come in from the bullpen pitch a couple of innings and anything i can do to help the team i will
2359283 he got us to hit the ball on the ground
2359284 when you dont throw a million mph youve got to be able to hit your spots and just let them know that youre going to control that part of the plate
2359285 apparently there is a third inning in detroit when youre pitching
2359286 if you look at that right handed hitting starting lineup for us it was pretty impressive
2359287 a lot of people thought he was over the hill at that time
2359288 but he still brought more to the ballpark than most human beings ever thought of
2359289 he had instincts and insights into the game that far outstripped anybody we had on that team he still had the best first step quickness ive ever seen in terms of taking an extra base for a young guy like me it was a privilege to call him a teammate
2359290 the fastest player ive seen since allen iverson was a rookie
2359291 i always have a vox event up my sleeve wink i know many more will be coming this way soon
2359292 we are all going to miss sarge who was a patriot first and a professional golfer second
2359293 he embodied a bit of golfs everyman whom we all could identify with
2359294 the usga was proud to call orville moody an open and senior open champion
2359295 while his victory in the 1969 open at the champions was a surprise orvilles superb ball striking talents were thankfully showcased over the next quarter century both on the regular and senior tour the expression he could golf his ball certainly applied to orville
2359296 if the first thing you want to do is try out some examples please start with reading the
2359297 this library is mainly aimed at real time computer vision
2359298 rarely we repair in this way we lost our sense of interest in technology clock delay brings this feeling back
2359299 with only 60 percent of democrats choosing him johnson received 41 076 votes with more than 67 percent of 10th district republicans backing mchenry he still only got 34 457 votes
2359300 we went out by the fence by where they come out after the concert
2359301 there were maybe 1 000 people around a chain link fence so we had to hold it up to get their attention and they would notice it and come over to us
2359302 id like to do one in streator i grew up there so i know the town it would be more personal to me
2359303 they help draw more people back into town again even if its just for the day
2359304 ive gotten to meet a lot of people this way
2359305 my biggest thing has always been rock n roll music
2359306 if someone wants me to draw them thinner fatter younger older i can do that too
2359307 our goal is to fit as much garbage in as possible
2359308 its pretty impressive what you have to do to operate a landfill its not just digging a hole and dumping stuff into it people should see this
2359309 i wanted to get a first up look because of the situation we had with the odor it looks like they are working hard to correct things and be good neighbors i imagine its tough being a landfill because its not quite what your neighbors want to have next to them but they have to be somewhere
2359310 i think this event today shows landcomps trying to do everything they need to do to circumvent if at all possible any kind of bad feelings with their neighbors
2359311 such as you could see and such as you could hear they seem to be doing competent engineering work
2359312 they have not solved the problem with the leachate instead they are plastering it over with this hoopla and a free lunch
2359313 weve been watching this development since four star marina closed
2359314 the real estate economy is not in our favor but in spite of that people are coming to heritage harbor and they like what they see
2359315 were right about on target and the real thrust will be next spring
2359316 and its a broad range of ages and demographics from young couples to retirees
2359317 we havent changed the direction of the development were making the ps3 version first and then porting to the 360 later
2359318 im telling them not to think about the xbox 360 right now we can think about it after the development kits arrive
2359319 the announcement of the release of final fantasy xiii on the xbox 360 at this years e3 is at the moment still at the planning stage we dont have any further information regarding the release date or the possibility of localization
2359320 in fact ive been doing so since final fantasy vi
2359321 forget it forget the whole thing i dont need it
2359322 ill be shaved and in street clothes by the time you arrive
2359323 you have nothing in your brake fluid tank i have a quart at home lets give it a try
2359324 people assume me to be smarter than i really am when it comes to some things and with some things i am reasonably okay in the smarts department but with other things matters mechanical a lawn grub could put me to shame
2359325 im 100 percent with them they were playing to put this country on the top and they took a lot of risks to go to those games
2359326 you have to be careful because you are representing your country if you decide not to play you have to let people in our country know why you are not going
2359327 our country doesnt take things real well when they lose and it was a tough situation for our country there were a lot of mistakes made by the people running the team
2359328 they dont have the right practice im not going to say they picked the wrong people but they werent prepared good enough to make that trip
2359329 those players werent physically ready and in the condition to represent the country i have to respect the players opinions because they have a lot of reason to say not to go there again
2359330 i said that the united states doesnt even know who was on that team four years ago but we are still talking about this team that lost
2359331 the passion venezuela has for baseball is different from everywhere else every other week they come up with something different about that competition
2359332 our offence has been doing a great job driving the ball down the field and putting it in the end zone and those times that we dont get into the end zone its my job to come out and put it through the uprights
2359333 im definitely feeling good and i just have to continue doing it every week
2359334 everybody knows how the cfl works the flip flops the first half of the season and the second half of the season teams get hot and you want to be in first place
2359335 to be in first place says a lot because everybody talent wise theres a lot of parity
2359336 thats the great balance of our team theres a lot of weapons
2359337 there would always be one play that we dont make and weve got to make that play to keep the drive going
2359338 like ryan expressed some guys are playing good some arent
2359339 in this sport as everybody knows its not a one man show its the team the team has to win and were not getting a team effort right now
2359340 a persona characterized by a lack of traditional heroic qualities
2359341 a being of great strength and courage celebrated for bold exploits often the offspring of a mortal and a god
2359342 i dont have to kill you but i dont have to save you either
2359343 we three fossils vow to put our name in the history book because it is ours and ours alone
2359344 i know i know i sit on the opposite side of the shul
2359345 i know i know but my mother in law is on that side and you know how it is she would be insulted
2359346 what do you think why do you think im wearing a jacket
2359347 when you go to someone elses house you are always on your best behavior when you are with family you can act like yourself
2359348 when europeans first came to africa they considered the architecture very disorganized and thus primitive it never occurred to them that the africans might have been using a form of mathematics that they hadnt even discovered yet
2359349 research programs should be planned together and their budgets should be developed together
2359350 the question would be to ask if it would make doing our science easier
2359351 is not how youd set it up if you were starting fresh
2359352 we should be looking to the future and designing our scientific institutions around the challenges we face
2359353 the main issue is not bureaucratic organisation but the lack of interest at any level in funding interagency or interdisciplinary programs
2359354 if not now when it can be done at the beginning of a new administration easier than at any other time
2359355 this is an opportunity to be able to make the case for more funding and turn this into a truly world class institution
2359356 hes langdon f king awesome but at this point id have to say no on him becoming the new singer
2359357 we just have to make sure its the right guy karmically we deserve the right guy its a tough thing man we make a pretty big noise
2359358 i am paying for hd channels but none of the channels are coming in right now and i have now missed half of the olympic opening ceremony
2359359 we are experiencing technical difficulties in springfield at the moment
2359360 any idea when this is going to be back up
2359361 we are hoping within the hour but it could be a few
2359362 it knows when youve been sleeping it knows when youre awake it knows when youve been bad or good so be good for goodness sake
2359363 jeez both series are completely ridiculous but star wars is maniacally laughably god like in the power mass energy etc
2359364 uhh yeah well whenever you notice something like that a wizard did it
2359365 who the f are you how many hit records do you have
2359366 were you scared he was going to beat you with a phone or a champagne bottle
2359367 if a wall streeter is selling you dont want to be buying end of story
2359368 were entering into our downturn as well as europe while the u s might be stabilizing theyre ahead of us in the curve
2359369 my sense is that the u s went through an awful few months and were just entering those few months now
2359370 canada has been considered a bastion of economic stability unlike the u s the u k europe japan which are already in recession or heading that way
2359371 canada until recently has held up quite well but this jobs report is a sign that its our turn now
2359372 the u s dollar has already weakened and now the other countries are catching up
2359373 its a schizophrenic market with the attention span of a nanosecond
2359374 the clarity is just not there and it will take time for the smoke to clear
2359375 ive learned a lot become a better professional and a better man because of my experience and my time in new york i dont regret or feel ashamed about anything that happened to me in my time in new york
2359376 the most difficult part is just the realization that the organization no longer wants you
2359377 you spend eight years there and in the blink of an eye youre no longer wanted there
2359378 he should protest and make it known that in the countries of the world there are nations the proof was provided the prime minister of canada himself
2359379 you are my drug more deadly than afghan heroin more dangerous than colombian white
2359380 let her piss on my face just so i could see where its coming from
2359381 no no this is from an alien device called an annosyniciser
2359382 i understand that girl i can get inside her i see her motivations
2359383 we have to give you a line it doesnt make sense if we dont
2359384 tax laws that restore some balance to the distribution of the nations wealth
2359385 so many of the disparities that exist in the african american community today can be directly traced to inequalities passed on from an earlier generation that suffered under the brutal legacy of slavery and jim crow
2359386 my friends we will disagree on a specific issue and thats healthy
2359387 i believe in renewable fuels i dont believe in ethanol subsidies but i believe in renewable fuels
2359388 my mission and my job as president of the united states will be to make sure every market in the world is open to your products
2359389 agriculture products here in the state of iowa can feed the world and were not afraid to compete with anybody
2359390 this is the heartland of america this is what america is all about this is the people i want to know and meet
2359391 he voted against ethanol subsidies hes opposed to the farm bill
2359392 what it proves is he doesnt care about whats important to iowa
2359393 good luck in new york state but we cant pay the taxes
2359394 i havent made that plan yet i think ill cross that bridge when i come to it
2359395 im definitely going to miss all my customers all my regulars have been fantastic
2359396 not enough parents feel that they are the main ones to teach the word of god
2359397 thats not taking anything away from the church but in gods word it says parents are to be the main teachers
2359398 the games skits and each lesson create more interest in the word of god
2359399 they talk about the family getting together they play the games over and over and it creates greater interest in the word of god
2359400 i used to take a normal aerobics class but it was boring and monotonous
2359401 so i tried out pole dancing its a really social activity ive met a lot of girls here who im now close friends with and i like that it makes me feel sexy
2359402 im not good at science like my parents im the black sheep of my family in that sense
2359403 i wandered into a pub and there was a woman dancing on the stage
2359404 people here have never seen a pole dance and for that reason they dont associate it with stripping or women of ill repute
2359405 i knew if i could give people a positive first impression of this as a clean fun social activity people wouldnt just accept it theyd embrace it
2359406 most of the people in the audience had no idea what this was
2359407 i think this is just a fad and i dont think its appropriate for women
2359408 the struggle itself is enough to fill a mans heart one must imagine sisyphus happy
2359409 a company that actively demonstrates its commitment to the gay and lesbian community
2359410 mais tr s soldados faleceram esta noite ap s os ataques

2359416 i dont know this is my bosss work computer im just lugging it about for the lazy bastard

2359679 best the most readable option i could think of would be hcard inside hatom
2359680 xal looks like theres a 500 page spec with a meta meta model you need to read before youre allowed in the club
2359681 it should be possible to add atom support to all the applications that currently only deal with html and it should be possible to add hatom support in feed readers
2359682 atom and hcard is a hybrid so im either using the wrong toolset or context switching between two different representation models
2359683 how do you handle publishing and updating of address data using hcard

2359686 theres a million students in the primary schools in peru and every one of them will be getting one of our computers
2359687 the olpc plans to support a dual boot option that would enable children to use either linux or windows on the same machine
2359688 olpc got other companies to look at the commercial possibilities in a much more serious manner
2359689 with a profit driven company the risks taken at olpc wouldnt have been taken
2359690 the high degree of risk taking resulted in a better product for profit companies look at olpc as a crucible of creativity
2359691 were going to sell over a million computers this year which is roughly 250 million in revenue
2359692 thats a pretty amazing statistic if you look at how companies measure their performance
2359693 weve said all were going to say about the olpc project and have no interest in revisiting it
2359694 we applaud all efforts to get pcs and technology into the hands of children in developing markets
2359695 i certainly underestimated the degree to which commercial interests would sabotage a deal or the degree to which olpc would find itself in an amd intel proxy war
2359696 the truth is that those companies see children as a market not a mission rwanda or mongolia salespeople want sales and in the case of intel they do not want amd to get any toehold the result startling in fact is analogous to mcdonalds competing with the world food program
2359697 ive been writing it over the years as ive been watching the date grow

2359703 i go sean youre such a great actor but you wouldnt do a scene like this if they asked you you wouldnt dive into a pool naked

2359723 i encountered change from an early age as my family moved from one cultural environment to another this was the beginning of my fascination with how objects and relationships change as landscapes and contexts alter
2359724 funny things you learn from your momma like the way you throw your hair back when youre swallowing pills
2359725 i dont know where this all came from its hilarious its like somebody says something and they run like wildfire with this stuff
2359726 it would be easier in a lot of ways if i did
2359727 if she did she was crueler than i would have ever imagined
2359728 we tried to tell you that she wasnt good for you danny she never deserved you
2359729 youre doing great things for your country i know its hard to see but everything you do here helps the big picture
2359730 man that guy knows how to drive in those runs doesnt he
2359731 you hate to see those guys come up in those situations theyre rbi machines
2359732 i knew i hit it well but i saw him dive for the ball and said noooo
2359733 i was playing in a little bit trying to stop the bleeding with a runner on second base
2359734 it mightve been tailing away a little bit it was close thats all i had there was nothing else left in the tank i was at full speed
2359735 over the last couple of months i dont think theres been a better player in the league not just hitting but fielding too
2359736 when things are going bad what can go bad will go bad
2359737 it doesnt last forever but when youre in it it feels like it
2359738 la maddalena sequestrate 11 barche c anche quella di benigni
2359739 he didnt want to go in there because he felt something was not right
2359740 i wanted to try to some way kind of do what they used to do when they traveled around in the old days
2359741 taking the train where the players can move around and relax a little bit will give us some time that i think we need at this point to get ready for a game
2359742 i had me a long vacation not saying that i wanted it
2359743 its football season and im happy to be back to work
2359744 im doing everything that im supposed to do to make sure i get reinstated
2359745 im not even worried about that right now im worried about playing football staying out of trouble and making sure i know my plays
2359746 ive never really gotten nervous for preseason games but im sure i will because im in a new uniform
2359747 ive ridden on the train before when i was in philly we did ride the train to washington its going to be fun for everybody
2359748 i guess that was when i kind of discovered i had a special knack for finding my way to the ball and it was more fun making the tackles is much more fun than blocking
2359749 but deep down hes very competitive hes really out here every day trying to do everything he can to be the best in the business hes got all the tools
2359750 i just want to continue to do what ive been doing concentrate on trying to get better
2359751 my main focus is to just try to make myself better and try to make this defense better overall thats my only goal just to do my part
2359752 weve found that we can give him quite a bit of responsibility and he can handle it
2359753 you have to take what you learn in the classroom and bring it out here to the field
2359754 he comes out here and executes it exactly day in and day out no matter how much weve installed
2359755 there are always plays that you wish you could have back
2359756 the film is always going to be there nobodys ever going to go out and have a perfect game you have mental busts brain freezes things just happen or you may think you really hit someone and youre the one who ends up stunned
2359757 i see things i do wrong all the time i still think i can get so much better
2359758 hes going to suit up and i sure hope were ok so that he doesnt have to go out there
2359759 i think he could go out there in a real real emergency situation
2359760 i think hes in a position now where his due is coming
2359761 the guys getting recognized as a legitimate top of the rotation guy for any team in the big leagues im glad a lot of other people are starting to recognize what hes all about were very very fortunate to have him
2359762 i dont feel any different with my record today than i did a month ago
2359763 i really feel that for the most part when ive been on the mound our team has been in the game thats the most important part
2359764 jeremy guthrie set the tone he set down a very good offensive club tonight
2359765 im not making no excuses because that guy over there threw pretty good thats the first time we had it handed to us in a while
2359766 those two guys put fear into a pitching staff but we have to go with what we have
2359767 you cant always rely on offense you have to pitch to stay in close games sometimes
2359768 the last thing we him to do is get frustrated
2359769 you have drawn this card today because it is time for you to break free from the restrictions caused by such believes your life is on the verge of a beautiful transformation yet in order for this transformation to occur you must first examine your believes you are worthy of happiness you deserve to be and have all your heart desires honour respect and love yourself
2359770 ive learned a lot become a better professional and a better man because of my experience and my time in new york i dont regret or feel ashamed about anything that happened to me in my time in new york
2359771 the most difficult part is just the realization that the organization no longer wants you
2359772 you spend eight years there and in the blink of an eye youre no longer wanted there
2359773 i was just waiting for vince to tell me to go
2359774 thats what youre supposed to do as a ballplayer thats respecting the game
2359775 you never know whos watching he could have easily thought he popped up and gave up on the ball and it ended up being a single
2359776 this is the time to come together this is a family

2359779 most people that we deal with do it because its fun so all of our customers are passionate about airplanes
2359780 what ive learned is this business like any other business is all people oriented
2359781 sure youre selling airplanes and fuel but its really all about relationships with customers and employees
2359782 customers can sense that because they walk in and get the same friendly attention from all the employees

2359785 isnt it true that you have no idea who killed laura doyle
2359786 the only reason chris is the most likely suspect in this case is because he lived with his mother
2359787 they came at me like they were trying to scare me

2359792 it is my personal commitment that no late filer is left behind and it is vitally important for all black farmers to act swiftly by obtaining counsel now
2359793 i ordered you a drink if thats all right still fond of those extremely dirty martinis
2359794 you look amazing youre in clear violation of the ex girlfriend rule you know
2359795 ex girlfriend rule i dont think i know that one
2359796 well its quite explicit thou must have twenty kids be married to some loser from high school and weigh two hundred pounds thou definitely must not be still attractive
2359797 i see youre still unable to be serious about anything
2359798 i tried out serious for a year or so it didnt take
2359799 you were the last person i expected to hear from today jonah where have you been
2359800 i was in burma teaching villagers how to play poker
2359801 nah kidding here and there actually i sold my car and condo and just left one day i couldnt take norman anymore
2359802 nowhere at first i hitchhiked out of oklahoma and went up to new york from there i went to europe and just wandered for awhile
2359803 no lost maybe i was sitting on the porch one day and just had a sense that i had no idea who i was there was nothing keeping me in norman you were gone tim and brody were hatching yet another scheme to perfect society i think it was a commune this time i just had an emptiness inside so i left
2359804 so you just wandered for seven years joined a monastery or two
2359805 nah the money ran out after the third year and the monks threw me out when they figured out i thought the vow of celibacy was more of a guideline i ended up working on a fishing boat out of majorca for a while then i had to fly back to the states for my fathers funeral
2359806 thanks it was hard to see him like that i know theyre supposed to look at rest or something but he looked like a wax copy of my dad i think i just didnt want to admit that he was really gone
2359807 i went back to school after that and now im a corporate headhunter
2359808 basically i am like a talent scout for businesses my clients tell me what kind of people they need and i beg borrow and kidnap them from other business and universities that or i snatch a few talented people from here and there and ransom them off to the highest bidder
2359809 so how do you like it seems a far cry from the crazy schemes you used to cook up
2359810 true but i had to grow up at least a little sooner or later its not bad i feel guilty sometimes about how much i make im good at it but it doesnt take much i mostly just go out and schmooze both clients and talent its really nothing more than a lot of dinners and bar meets occasionally theres research and projections i worry that eventually someone is going to figure out i am really only getting paid to hang out with people after they do theyll put an end to it
2359811 part of me i think the rest is still in progress but enough about me what about you
2359812 no i met casey about six years ago weve been married for five now youd like him i think he has a similar sense of humor
2359813 most of the time money is a little scarce but hes good to me hes stable we have two children theyre little terrors the both of them we call them kid vicious and the princess theyre a handful but theyre worth it how long are you in town you should come and meet them all you were always great with kids
2359814 thank you jess but i dont think its a good idea
2359815 im sorry jess im glad that youre happy honestly i just think it would be awkward you know old flame visiting bound to make casey a little uncomfortable
2359816 no he would be fine with it we trust each other
2359817 thats good like he ever stood a chance with your stubborn streak anyhow i wont be in town long anyway im just meeting with some prospective clients and then jetting out i ran into your dad back home and he told me you were here in seattle i almost didnt call
2359818 what are you looking for here jonah you disappeared for so long and just show up and call me what do you want from me
2359819 closure what do you mean you ended us back then not me
2359820 i know jess it doesnt make sense i sometimes think there is something wrong with me i get in these whirlwind romances with some truly amazing women then one day out of the blue it just clicks off im empty almost hollow usually when that happens i just move on but with you it was different a month or so after i ended it i realized i had made a mistake but it was too late you had moved up here and i couldnt get a hold of you your dad wouldnt tell me where you went he was pretty angry with me
2359821 i was pretty upset then i dont think i went a day without crying and my dad never could handle tears well you just provided a focus for his frustration he really liked you
2359822 yeah he was easy to get along with it was nice to talk with him again
2359823 i think the real reason i left was that i had to find out who i was without you i had some crazy idea that if i could just find myself i could be worthy of chasing you down and doing everything i could to get you back but it just didnt work out that way every place i went was just as hollow as i felt inside so i just kept moving trying to either lose or find myself im still not sure which probably both
2359824 i guess i just felt like that with you being gone i had missed out on something that could have been amazing in my life what was worse was that i had ended it and not you so i had just thrown it away
2359825 jonah i am happy with my life i wouldnt change it for the world i admit that i am sometimes surprised when i look around at what i have and you arent in it but i am happy
2359826 i think i think thats what i needed to hear im glad that you sorted your life out it looks like you have a good one here i am more than a little envious of it i think i just needed to see it to move completely on
2359827 it was good to see you jess i should be going
2359828 jonah why did you break up with me back then
2359829 i think whether i want to admit it or not i just knew that there was someone who could love you more than i could
2359830 i had kate winslet right up to the last week in pre production then she said she couldnt do the picture because she had worked continually and had spent no time with her child
2359831 i forgave her and understood that completely but i didnt know scarlett from a hole in the wall i thought she was too young she was only 19 years old at the time
2359832 but i was in a hole and had to get someone fairly quickly i knew scarlett was a great actress and a beauty but i didnt know if she was really what i had written i hired her and became totally captivated by her
2359833 i would always call her as i did with diane and mia for years mia was a wonderful actress and she never let me down the same would be true with scarlett
2359834 until dogs and cats can go on the pill or wear condoms we need to help them practice safe sex by spaying and neutering
2359835 you will be surprised to know that the english word greed it may have been jsut a coincidence that the english word greed but my feeling is that this cannot be just coincidence there must be something more mysterious behind it there must be some alchemical reason behind it greed digested love it is greed lobha digested well which becomes love is sharing greed is hoarding greed only wants and never gives and love knows only giving and never asks for anything in return it is unconditional sharing there may be some alchemical reason that in english language lobha becomes love as far as inner alchemy is concerned

2359863 everyone at victory is ecstatic about the forthcoming album from hawthorne heights it is by far their best material to date when victory and hawthorne started our relationship in 2003 it was always about beating the odds our country has just seen and experienced historic change with the democratic nomination of barack obama everything happens for a reason and there is tremendous positivity in the air we have lived in a reality of petty disputes unresolved misunderstandings unhealthy friction and negative sensationalism for too long forgiveness and the ability to reunite are powerful gifts they create a spirit couple that spirit with great music and you have something that is extraordinary and transcendental you cannot change the past but you can affect the future there is a bigger lesson and story here than just releasing a new album victory and i know hawthorne heights are thankful to be a part of that

2359878 for of him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory forever
