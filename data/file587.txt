5870007 cedo para dizer como vai ser porque vai depender da orienta o m dica mas ela n o vai abandonar a campanha de jeito nenhum
5870008 neste domingo fizemos uma reuni o com todos os nossos candidatos a vereador aqui na cidade e ela de maring participou pelo viva voz do telefone disse que n o vai esmorecer
5870009 gibt es ein land auf der erde wo der traum wirklichkeit ist ich wei es wirklich nicht ich wei nur eins und da bin ich sicher dieses land ist es nicht
5870010 you hit a hurdle about twice a year where it affects your race
5870011 its just a shame that it happened on the biggest race of my life
5870012 i was already getting up and elated coming off the turn because i know how my races usually go i just had a really tough break on that one
5870013 why should it be spoiled unless someone tries to spoil it for me
5870014 im going to out there to run my heart out
5870015 it was like racing a car at max velocity when you hit a curve you either maintain control or you crash and burn
5870016 today i crashed and burned im shocked and sad but im happy for the girls
5870017 look if we can all agree that blogging is marketing then we can agree that the goal of blogging is to generate new clients and retain existing ones and like all marketing efforts when the costs exceeds the benefit its time to reconsider the marketing plan time spent blogging is time spent marketing and there is a real cost for doing it
5870018 these are the judgments ive made and the policies that we have to debate because we do have differences in this election
5870019 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
5870020 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5870021 barack obama has made it clear that unconditional withdrawal in iraq is more important to him than victory in iraq thats not a criticism of his patriotism thats a criticism of his judgment
5870022 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed
5870023 i noticed him when he came to collect pension for years from the bank he started with a pension of rs 1 28 in 1938 which finally rose to rs 2 698
5870024 his four sons and wife passed away several years ago
5870025 sorry i am not involved and have never really been i know nothing more than you do
5870026 yet they went after him and subjected him to all kinds of questioning and even conducted lie detector tests
5870027 this could have gone on for years and he must have said enough was enough and decided to get on with his life
5870028 but he was mentally very tired seemed like he wanted to get away from it all in the sense that he wanted this ordeal to end be home relax
5870029 he was like either i sent the mail or i didnt and they should take action based on that
5870030 my personal feeling is that he will come back he was happy here and had nothing against india but i think it will also depend on what the directors of his company decide since his case has got a lot of bad publicity for the company
5870031 we are still completely shocked such a thing could not and should not have happened it is completely absurd that haywood was not identified and detained at the airport
5870032 he bashir has confessed that he was involved in the planning and execution of the blasts
5870033 the team has been directed to submit its report within seven days
5870034 the report will make sure that nothing unforeseen happened during the trials
5870035 we have deployed a team on the pune mumbai expressway for this purpose
5870036 the bombay high court had asked atram to remain present at the pune court till the order was passed if the court had passed his bail rejection order immediately after the arguments we would have arrested him in the court premises
5870037 but after the arguments the court said the order would be given after one and a half hours during this time atram left the court in his car our team as also a police squad was right behind him but he gave us the slip
5870038 it was not the duty of only the forest department to keep a watch on the former minister even the police squad was unable to trace him

5870047 earlier the sewage from the darbar locality used to flow out of the village but about three years ago they changed the direction of the water and made it flow towards our village
5870048 with the sewage flowing straight into our area we have major water contamination
5870049 i got the water tested at a gandhinagar laboratory and informed the talati and the sarpanch that the water is unfit for drinking
5870050 i have also told them to ensure that the sewage discharge is stopped to prevent serious health implications but nothing has been done
5870051 yes there are issues with the dalits here but we do not wish to discuss it with you
5870052 i have arrested 12 men as a preventive measure and produced them in the local court where they have been granted bail
5870053 most of us work in their fields now they have stopped giving us work they also stopped us from working in other villages
5870054 selection of grantees and disbursement of grants should be done by zonal cultural centres zccs at the zonal level while retaining the present central sector character of the schemes
5870055 instead the schemes may be advertised on the website of the ministry without prescribing any last date a circular can also be issued in the beginning of each year to all the state governments to widely disseminate the information about the schemes of the ministry of culture

5870061 all night we were looking at where the rain was falling where the heaviest rain was falling again making any adjustments turning on additional pumps
5870062 we have more structures and canals that we are monitoring and they were impressed
5870063 in the middle of a storm you cant send someone out to actually do it so we are able to do it from here which is again a tremendous leverage of technology
5870064 in the next five years approximately 530 000 full time permanent employees will leave the federal government
5870065 because of hiring freezes and downsizing in the 1990s the government cannot fill the vacancies from its internal talent
5870066 opportunities for flexible work schedules job sharing and teleworking arrangements are available
5870067 we have determined that we cannot continue with business as usual
5870068 nothing about us needing to explain to someone why where to and for how long the black sea fleet ships are leaving their walls
5870069 without a doubt there wont be any mine fences or military collisions one shouldnt even talk about that

5870072 ninety per cent of the work is convincing people that the eyes are real
5870073 the subtlety of the timing of eye movements is a big one people also have a natural asymmetry for instance in the muscles in the side of their face those types of imperfections arent that significant but they are what makes people look real
5870074 theres always been control systems for different facial movements but say in the past you had a dial for controlling whether an eye was open or closed and in one frame you set the eye at 3 4 open the next 1 2 open etc this is like achieving that degree of control with much finer movements
5870075 for instance you could be controlling the movement in the top 3 4mm of the right side of the smile
5870076 there came a point where animators were trying to create a face and there was a theory of diminishing returns
5870077 if youre trying to process the graphics in a photo realistic animation in real time theres a lot of computation involved

5870080 this is like the ultimate youve got striking youve got grappling youve got weapons anything goes
5870081 the sad fact is that come christmas time we estimate that one million australians will suffer mortgage stress thats a huge number of people that are potentially going to face losing their property unless drastic action is taken

5870083 i would not have nominated clarence thomas i dont think that he was an exp a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation
5870084 although i dont think theres any doubt about his intellectual brilliance uh because he and i just disagree
5870085 i profoundly disagree with his interpretations of a lot of the constitution
5870086 you said in idaho recently im quoting here i have no intention of taking away folks guns but you support the d c gun ban and youve said that its constitutional
5870087 the myth developed that when there was a tough vote he was gone

5870093 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state

5870097 it is appalling to me that people still want to invoke my fathers name five years after his death to ascribe beliefs ideals values and loyalties to him that cannot possibly be determined and to try to further their own agendas by doing so
5870098 somebodys got to walk the line in the country theyve got to walk it unapologetically and im sure johnny cash would have been a john mccain supporter if he was still around
5870099 i knew my father pretty well at least better than some of those who entitle themselves to his legacy and his supposed ideals
5870100 and even i would not presume to say publicly what i know he thought or felt this is especially dangerous in the case of political affiliation
5870101 we can never be surprised at what vile evil comes from the mouth of a confessed victim of child abuse at the hands of her own parents
5870102 roseannes parents responded to the accusation by going on the air and slating she is a psychopathic liar and her sister agreed
5870103 her defaming of our national anthem in 1990 gave us insight into who she is and what she is capable of saying and doing
5870104 miss jolie says she likes john mccain too and hasnt decided who to endorse huh
5870105 arent you supposed to be somewhat enlightened or do you not know that the african daughter you hold in every picture had parents who suffered and died because of the republican partys worldwide economic assault on africa over the last few decades since reagan
5870106 my allegiance to senator mccain becomes stronger with any assault that tries to deter my loyalty to him
5870107 i can only pray that good people see her for what she is sick of mind
5870108 it wasnt as bad as i thought it would be
5870109 im not much of a small talker and i dont think she is either i was a little nervous because i hadnt seen or talked to her in 14 years everyone was making it out to be such a big deal that i think we both fell prey to having that affect us
5870110 everybody was on pins and needles and sort of waiting to see how theyd react
5870111 they started off kind of tentative but by the time we were five takes in they were giggling and seemed to be reconnecting
5870112 were both grown women both professionals once we were working it felt like a good fit
5870113 the cw has no deal with to appear on 90210 at this time
5870114 i know that shannen probably doesnt share the feelings that i have for tori but i love tori like my sister
5870115 mccain doesnt need to talk about his religion because hes from a generation that is private about it
5870116 crudes just getting pulled up by heating oil it was a quick pop and technical triggers may have been hit
5870117 especially since there is a clear lack of buying momentum
5870118 venezuela would have to analyze the possibility of a production cut
5870119 we are truly excited to be part of the first annual atlanta forum
5870120 as the sister show to the phoenix forum attendees will be treated with class and the atmosphere to do business will be ideal the 12clickscash end of summer pool party is going to be a good time we look forward to catering to our current and potential affiliates and business partners
5870121 i cannot stop one human being even a presidential candidate from admiring the courage and sacrifice of peaceful protesters on the edmund pettus bridge or making comments about it
5870122 sen mccain and i are colleagues in the us congress not confidantes he does not consult me and i do not consult him
5870123 mudgee is currently the fastest growing coal producing region in nsw
5870124 if planned expansion of the three mines ulan wilpinjong and moolarben goes ahead there will be between forty and fifty million tonnes of coal produced per year from this area
5870125 there is two and a half tonnes of co2 produced from every tonne of coal which means the mudgee region could be responsible for the release of 150 million tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere
5870126 it creates severe subsidence and interferes with the ground water system
5870127 subsidence can also initiate tremors which can be the equivalent of small earthquakes
5870128 we want to extend the goulburn river national park to include the drip gorge and land currently held in lease by the moolarben mine
5870129 when you see the enormous devastation caused to a pristine environment by coal mining companies its outrageous enough
5870130 but when you convert the practice into greenhouse gas emissions its terrifying and australia is one of the biggest emitters in the world

5870141 the episodes they sent to me were really engaging and wonderful and kind of dark and moody
5870142 my concern is not if i run the whole marathon if im running it or walking it doesnt really matter to me
5870143 i just want to know that im in shape enough that i could do it im so excited although training has been a lot harder than i thought
5870144 i eat tiny snacks every hour and a half whether its a bite of salad a piece of cheese or an apple
5870145 i also keep avocados in my trailer i cut one in half and put lime juice on it its the greatest snack it has good fat and will really fill you up
5870146 i so wish i had listened to my mom and grandma when i was 18 and would complain about some little tiny bump or feeling bloated
5870147 i used to scoff and say no i feel fat today now the jokes on me i wish i had been nude from the time i was 12 until i was 28 i looked great
5870148 i want to tell all young girls to walk around in bikinis all summer and enjoy it i want to tell them to never ever feel bad about anything because there will be that one day in your 20s when youll eat a hamburger and actually see the hamburger on the side of your leg
5870149 initially its shocking and you think whoa i have to actually think about what i eat and work out double the amount i did before
5870150 i did quite a few run throughs to practice and whilst banking on one such run the engine cut out i had no steering i therefore continued in a straight line directly into a wooden boat house
5870151 there i was as a fearless 007 hobbling on a cane to my boat and then pretending to be indestructible for the cameras who says i cant act
5870152 he was a huge bond fan and said that he would love to direct one of the films
5870153 hed recently had great success with jaws and close encounters and was considered a very hot property i was rather excited at this news and went looking for film producer albert r cubby broccoli to tell him
5870154 do you know how much of a percentage hed want
5870155 its always been policy that no bond director ever got a slice of the box office profits
5870156 ugobe is unique the companies aim is to transform the relationship between technology and the machine and creating a personality for the machine
5870157 the initial target market for pleo was the technical enthusiast and create a suspended belief that baby dinosaurs would act as pleo does and we chose pleo as they are based in the location where the dinosaurs were being excavated there was a lot of local research easily and readily available for us to use
5870158 dinosaurs arent like a dog or a cat so there arent any real expectations just peoples imagination
5870159 most new stuff that we are looking at is radically different from pleo
5870160 there is a developer interface due out soon with some advanced tools the developer program will allow the creators to interact and create new emotions and interactions with the pleo the program should be available within the next month
5870161 processing power memory engines etc are all starting to make the vision a reality the biggest challenge is the battery life and ugobe are looking towards wireless power mips per watt is a problem currently we are keeping a close eye on battery technology and in particular wireless power we are also looking at getting the devices to find themselves a plug socket or power supply unfortunately you cant make assumptions on where the devices interact with people so for example we cant assume sunlight and therefore cant assume to use solar power
5870162 the government has declared open war on indigenous people and the demonstrators will stay there until the problem is solved they prefer to die there they arent afraid
5870163 we are not provoking native communities but safeguarding areas that are of strategic importance for the country
5870164 the government has declared open war on indigenous people and the demonstrators will stay there until the problem is solved they prefer to die there they arent afraid
5870165 they are being stage managed by a group of lawyers who are deliberately misinforming them
5870166 we want to provide a solution to the fair demands of these communities because the government continues to act arrogantly without any ability to dialogue
5870167 the underlying problem is that the government is attempting to portray indigenous people as just another group of poor people without admitting that they have a different way of life a different cultural viewpoint
5870168 the authorities think they can calm the demands of indigenous people by building schools or medical clinics but the pending debt to the indigenous population is much more complex than that
5870169 they should not be seen as inferior because of their attempt to block the influx of private investment into their territories
5870170 the problem is that peru has a hard time seeing cultural differences as something positive as part of the countrys wealth peruvian society sees them instead as an obstacle
5870171 some non governmental organisations that are active in these issues are inciting people to do these kinds of things which in the end are subversive activities because they are undermining the foundations of democracy
5870172 how have they achieved the miracle of being able to bring together in one place at the same time communities so widely dispersed as the jungle peoples that will have to be investigated
5870173 peru which in past decades in the 1970s was in the vanguard with respect to indigenous issues is now in last place on the list
5870174 these protests might end in dialogue but the problem will continue because there are no government policies that value and respect indigenous people

5870177 ever since coach richt has gotten here our guys have trained like their heads are on fire
5870178 i think you see more of the young guys coming in willing to prepare and able to compete physically at this level
5870179 a majority of our team has been training since january every player that we have on the field this year has been training since that sugar bowl game for this sole purpose its something theyve taken very seriously every challenge weve thrown at them theyve accepted our motto for the year was man up for everything that weve done to try and break them every time theyve manned up
5870180 when a wide receiver is working next to a lineman he cant lift as much so hes not as motivated when hes around a bunch of guys who are at his same strength level they can push each other
5870181 we take time to make it a point to emphasize how important it is
5870182 im sure the coaches emphasize it a great deal as well year round

5870208 we had some concerns this morning because we are not sure what is in these old hotels it seems as though the wind is calm however and the rain is keeping the particulates close to the fire as our monitor is not picking up anything unusual
5870209 as we are located on queensway and upwind we do not register some activity it seems there have been a few fires in the same location lately that we have not picked up on we have been pushing for years to obtain a van or trailer we can drive to a site and monitor from the actual location these would be ideal in instances where fires could last for long periods of time and really have an impact

5870215 my good friend traveled to brazil and fell in love with a complete gentile he brought her to israel and intends on converting her
5870216 she said she was planning on traveling in israel for a few months so that they wouldnt deport her but if i notify the interior ministry that she is planning on staying here permanently she will be deported
5870217 i know that i will cause my friend grief and i am afraid that i will be denounced nonetheless i want to do this in order to fix things and i think that my friend fell in love with her for the wrong reasons and that the conversion will only be fictive what should i do

5870229 iran is the largest and strongest independent country in the middle east
5870230 irans response to any kind of military action that jeopardizes its interests will be swift resolute and crushing

5870232 in the event of military action by an enemy no one should expect iran to refrain from using every available means of self defense including closing the strait of hormuz with a view to damaging the invaders interests closing the strait of hormuz is part of irans defense policy in face of the u s military threat
5870233 the captors know that in the event of an attack on iran they will be unable to withdraw all their forces from iraq and afghanistan overnight and flee since the pasbandar region up to the delta of the arwand river i e shatt al arab which is considered one of the flanks of the persian gulf as well as part of the gulf of oman is controlled by iran meaning that iran maintains a hold on the enemys vital arteries
5870234 60 of all oil consumed worldwide passes through the persian gulf
5870235 these days although no incident has as yet occurred oil prices have risen from 12 to 120 a barrel now try to calculate how high the price of this essential commodity will rise if the enemy acts in a foolhardy manner compelling iran to defend itself

5870241 when they found him his condition wasnt good he was very weak and sick and obviously cold because he had been exposed to the cool weather over the last few days dr forster said
5870242 we will be looking at different ways to support the community particularly the office in terms of possibly putting up signs or providing training to the local guides to thank them for all their help dr forster said

5870328 he has had dramas in relation to bullying he suffered bullying at the start of the year when he was doing his first course and his family dealt with that nothing had materialised in this particular course but it may be that he kept a lid on it
5870329 its been an ongoing thing and its obviously eaten away at him and come to a head on saturday
5870330 there were no outward signs that he was feeling depressed the indication from the family was that he was feeling good and his behaviour was normal
5870331 i think what cases like this highlight is the sustained impact that bullying can have it can impact on peoples relationships their confidence and how they interact with others
5870332 even when bullying might itself come to an end it can have that sustained impact and thats why we need to stop bullying and get that message out and in this case change the way people see those with a disability
5870333 i think it highlights that despite the changes in community attitudes towards people with a disability we still have a lot of work to do

5870384 you are the average of the 5 people you spend most of your time with
5870385 what were seeing with the clones they present are the ones that look good
5870386 clone enough dogs and occasionally you have offspring that arent perfect
5870387 but its comparable to what you have through conventional breeding
5870388 then another group dies within a few days right after birth and of the ones that live 150 days about half of those die
5870389 the biological abnormalities inherent to the cloning procedure will always make cloning inferior to natural breeding
5870390 i dont think we will ever be able to fix the biological problems the process of fertilization is fundamentally different from sticking dna into an egg and generating clones
5870391 the extreme sensitivity of the canine reproductive system means you have to have an absolutely perfect pregnancy
5870392 in other systems you can just put a flawed embryo in and get offspring out
5870393 the idea that theres a holocaust of malformed offspring and all these miscarriages is false
5870394 there are cases where something appears to go wrong later
5870395 you get that with natural breeding too the question is whats the rate the big picture there havent been that many clones made to get a true feel

5870450 part of it is as were starting to come out of this economic downturn the majority party right now wants to raise taxes add to that the fact that the presidential race is a toss up and theyre going to want to wait and see

5870455 thats what i told them after the bowl game that was that team this is this team
5870456 weve done a lot this summer weve had a tough summer tougher than other summers
5870457 our play spoke for itself during the spring i think we had a little better spring than our offense
5870458 we still have to produce to help the offense take a weight off their shoulders
5870459 bowling green is known for their offense offense offense and we want to be known as a solid team not just offense we want the defense to be known
5870460 he was not my candidate but since he was here i have no doubt he will be a wonderful president
5870461 it gives them the opportunity for a one on one conversation i like the personal contact
5870462 they come to me ive talked with many people who didnt know me that well and are undecided about the race so its a good opportunity
5870463 if i had a company i would hire these guys today they were fantastic they did a really good job
5870464 it was a wonderful opportunity for offenders from both institutions to come out here and be an asset to the lima community
5870465 on veterans day or memorial day if someone wants to put a wreath out there for someone who has served their country they can do that
5870466 they have a place they can go to remember the people who served
5870467 any person can come here and say i thank the veterans for serving
5870468 this is a wonderful opportunity first to play two magnificent golf courses
5870469 to put together two good scores to win this thing im so proud of our kids
5870470 its a positive for our golf program my hat goes off to our guys who played real good golf over the last two days
5870471 there is a nice community involvement the first person i ever approached was jerry lewis with mcdonalds and he was more than happy to donate lunches sites grocery and tim fetter also bought the donuts its not cheap to get 12 dozen each day
5870472 for kids they just love to eat and play golf and those are the two things they get to do
5870473 the coaches get to know each other the players get to know each other
5870474 its just good for everyone i dont think the coaches have a bad thing to say about it
5870475 youve got to take it one shot at a time youve got 36 holes so if you have a bad hole you can always come back
5870476 you always gun for first you work hard for first seconds all right
5870477 we felt insulted because they wanted us to tour their plants to see how to be effective
5870478 he said we should not be surprised that the company leaders in norway were the ones orchestrating this plan against us
5870479 we were surprised about how arrogant honest and blunt he was about the situation no remorse
5870480 he knew what was going on and was well aware of it and didnt have a problem with it
5870481 said theyve never had problems with a union before like theyve had with us
5870482 i dont know if theyve ever asked for a 40 percent pay cut before
5870483 he suggested to our district representatives that we could offer him a proposal again
5870484 with the times being the way they are and our economy struggling its difficult to go to the public and ask them for a lot of money
5870485 we really want to show the community that we need to pass the levy and the sacrifice that i believe our membership is willing to make toward that goal
5870486 were paying an exorbitant price for the current system that were having but were not really seeing any return or getting any benefit out of the software maintenance money that were paying every year
5870487 were looking at going to a different system a different company that provides probably by far a better service at a cheaper price and has a better product a more user friendly product
5870488 thats the thing were looking at the current one weve got basically is pretty difficult to use its hard to navigate around through it
5870489 it doesnt surprise me the technology now is headed toward complete data management with the inclusion of almost no non voice communication in other words all transmitted data
5870490 im not surprised theres something being proposed that envelopes that our issue like anything else is going to be trying to figure out if we can do this given our current budget constraints because of the fact were now asking for a 0 25 percent increase in the sales tax
5870491 i guess i would have no choice but to be comfortable with it
5870492 i havent thought about a heisman campaign but i have thought about the heisman trophy
5870493 it got really bad the illinois game that was the worst it ever felt
5870494 oh man its a lot different just to play football the way i like to play football is the main thing
5870495 i couldnt be as physical as i wanted to be all the time i did it sometimes but i wasnt able to do it all the time
5870496 i wouldnt say im different im just different confidence wise
5870497 a person of substance would have presented himself to his fellow leaders among the pacific island countries to account for the undertaking he gave to them
5870498 what he has done is chicken out of that and i dont think that the leaders across the region will respond to that positively
5870499 the challenge for pacific countries is to have a united front on the question of fiji and to apply maximum political and diplomatic leverage on bainimaramas regime
5870500 i use the word regime because its not a democratically elected government and were not accustomed not to have democratically elected governments
5870501 there was little food left in our house it is good they have called off protests for sometime
5870502 help encourage young people to leverage their voting power in the political process
5870503 sometimes the first duty of intelligent men is the restatement of the obvious
5870504 in a series of e mails i patiently explained that bush couldnt be hitler since hitler was dead
5870505 when my grandfather left europe in 1937 the graffiti on the walls read jews go to palestine today the graffiti reads jews out of palestine how soon europe forgets
5870506 sometimes the first duty of intelligent men is the restatement of the obvious
5870507 promised to work with him seriously on a bipartisan lobbying and ethics reform package
5870508 in a series of e mails i patiently explained that bush couldnt be hitler since hitler was dead
5870509 when my grandfather left europe in 1937 the graffiti on the walls read jews go to palestine today the graffiti reads jews out of palestine how soon europe forgets
5870510 sometimes the first duty of intelligent men is the restatement of the obvious
5870511 in a series of e mails i patiently explained that bush couldnt be hitler since hitler was dead
5870512 when my grandfather left europe in 1937 the graffiti on the walls read jews go to palestine today the graffiti reads jews out of palestine how soon europe forgets
5870513 nothing about us needing to explain to someone why where to and for how long the are leaving their walls
5870514 without a doubt there wont be any mine fences or military collisions one shouldnt even talk about that
5870515 i think that russia is looking for a reason to have a serious conflict with ukraine
5870516 right now there are russian soldiers and tanks at poti
5870517 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances
5870518 it didnt take them really three or four days to get into georgia and it really shouldnt take them three or four days to get out
5870519 it got very sophisticated because obviously the battery doesnt last long and then we had to look at circuits and interrupters so we have been working on it around two months with a crack team
5870520 he didnt have just one chinese to beat tonight he had 10 000
5870521 zou has a lot of pressure because all the boxers know that he is the world champion
5870522 its very difficult for the boxers especially asian boxers because their skills are based on technique
5870523 if he can get another one at this olympics it would mean a lot to the whole of russia
5870524 hopefully i can keep the fun rolling to the 2012 olympics in london
5870525 a lot of boxers want to go pro and win titles but for me the last three years have been all about winning a medal
5870526 everyone in prison will be sad as they watched me on the tv
5870527 i wouldnt say jogging im just trying to get through to the next round i didnt know if he was running i just wanted to make sure i was in good position i was looking at crawford and then i decided to look at the board to see where everybody else was
5870528 hes just playful and he loves the sport someone who will race all the time someone who wont duck wont hide wont take drugs you cant ask for anything better
5870529 if you look back in the old days people were always doing that and thats what drew attention to the sport so its good to have someone like that around
5870530 i never believed this could happen i am shocked i dont think i will ever come back again i am happy with the three gold medals i have won
5870531 the same thing happened in the special and he didnt forget it today
5870532 i cant explain why it happened i just couldnt give him confidence its a shame because it was the best freestyle hes done
5870533 he had tension in the start and that was the difference
5870534 fourth in the olympics is not so bad its not quite enough but awfully close
5870535 i went after more difficulty and made mistakes but i was really happy with my horse
5870536 given to him by oink37 and bestows it upon cyress8
5870537 given to him by oink37 and bestows it upon cyress8 you
5870538 these are folks who were doing homeland security before homeland security became part of our national vernacular
5870539 it is not timely its not in the good spirit of our national day if we go ahead with the concert it is contrary to what we are preparing for

5870545 if singaporeans are antagonized nguyen will be hanged they dont like white people telling them how to run their country
5870546 do not be under any misapprehension you are not to go anywhere near my client and you are not instructed to take any steps on his behalf i have no obligation to further explain our position to you and i do not propose to do so
5870547 i humbly urge your good office to urgently intervene in stopping nguyens execution which would be a serious miscarriage of justice and would violate singapores constitution
5870548 there was a significant distance between our strategy and that of others
5870549 you do this and singapore airlines will fly empty between australia and the united states singapore airlines being an arm of the singaporean government
5870550 had we not founded the republic what would our country be like
5870551 we think about north korea devoid of freedom and liberation in which human rights are infringed upon the worst in the world
5870552 having just inherited weve lived without duly appreciating the happiness we enjoy observing the candlelight vigil uproar however weve learned we must safeguard liberal democracy by fighting with our bodies hands and conscience
5870553 pinsentry has its uses especially when creating new payees but for general access to ones account it is overkill and highly inconvenient
5870554 unfortunately the fraud gangs are very good at tricking customers out of their log on details and one of the ways to combat that is to bring in a one time only password
5870555 so if you are tricked by a fraud gang and do give away your details actually they become invalid because when youve used that once its only useful for that session
5870556 i love and respect my father most the putative dear leader said
5870557 this time last year i was buying a train ticket online and i got to the checkout box and it said promotional code but i didnt have one i searched on the internet and went from one website to another and found some discounts but some of them didnt work
5870558 eventually one worked but it took me 25 minutes so thats where the idea came from to put them all in one easy place for everyone to share
5870559 the site evolved just from a very basic website listing the discounts that i use to find and now the big retailers are working with us and sending us discounts direct they really want to be promoted in the site
5870560 of course they can pass it on to friends and neighbours who might be interested thats good news for the retailer because it widens the net of potential customers
5870561 the whole world condemned it the non aligned condemned the african union african league islamic countries the whole world condemning it
5870562 its politically motivated we will not show any respect to this our president will travel and travel and travel and he will come to turkey not only this time but later on also whenever he is invited
5870563 there have been no reports of serious injuries or property damage and no reports of incidents for any other ipod nano model
5870564 these are the judgments ive made and the policies that we have to debate because we do have differences in this election
5870565 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
5870566 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5870567 barack obama has made it clear that unconditional withdrawal in iraq is more important to him than victory in iraq thats not a criticism of his patriotism thats a criticism of his judgment
5870568 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed
5870569 nothing about us needing to explain to someone why where to and for how long the black sea fleet ships are leaving their walls
5870570 without a doubt there wont be any mine fences or military collisions one shouldnt even talk about that
5870571 i think that russia is looking for a reason to have a serious conflict with ukraine
5870572 dozens of people from the shiite community had gathered at the hospital where the bomb went off
5870573 as you know there has been sectarian tension here and this wave keeps decreasing and increasing so now we are having this sectarian wave a bit more and this is the result
5870574 todays bombing is very symbolic a pillar of the regime has been hit
5870575 i dont recall anything as big since the decade of the civil war
5870576 for extremists to target police is like hitting a symbol of repression it can help them rally a segment of the population
5870577 there were bodies scattered all over the road some corpses were completely charred you couldnt even recognize their faces
5870578 we support the government of algeria as best we can in trying to fight this
5870579 very firmly condemns the terrorist acts that have just claimed so many lives

5870591 in 2001 i had the thoughts but not the funds eventually i had to withdraw from my gpf utilised the money from the output of the agricultural land i had 24 kms from bhiwani mortgaged my home here and some other land in bhiwani to get a loan of rs four lakh from the grahmin bank to buy the land on which stands the bbc now
5870592 i want to build an ac indoor hall with two wooden rings i also want mirrors for the boxers so that they can correct their techniques

5870597 i think they need to go in there and get the people to do something with them or tear them down so they can keep the druggies and things out of there
5870598 unfortunately around some of these properties as we arrest somebody for an illegal deed on the property theres somebody else that then sets up shop and then continues with the illegal practice
5870599 fellow countrymen with deep sorrow and grief i would like to inform the people of zambia that our president dr levy patrick mwanawasa died this morning at 10 30 hours
5870600 i also wish to inform the nation that national mourning starts today and will be for seven days
5870601 the community deserves to have free entry for the learn to swim program its a community service which helps our kids learn to swim and swimming should be taught to every kid
5870602 to do this would only take 4000 and we definitely have enough money to fund the facilities in our region for the learn to swim program
5870603 chris giarrusso has been taking the superheroes of the marvel universe and has done the most brilliant thing ever

5870605 as gas prices skyrocket across the nation travelers everywhere are left feeling the pinch for summer vacations
5870606 tanks for staying was inspired by the knowledge that the added costs for a summer vacation are estimated to have increased 50 for the average family using their car to arrive to their destination with such high costs at the pump along with rising food prices we believe our guests deserve immediate help to salvage the family summer vacation
5870607 we all know there is a tremendous pinch at the pump right now with soaring gas prices throughout the nation
5870608 were hoping to relieve a little of that pain and keep summer travelers on the road with this extra incentive
5870609 iphones share of internet browsing is now four times that of windows mobile and nearly 40 percent of linuxs share
5870610 over the long term we expect iphones advantages to drive strong hardware revenue growth while providing new opportunities to monetize the user base through value added services
5870611 iphone 3g has generated its most impressive increase in browsing in japan where its share has grown to 0 12 percent from 0 01 percent over the past six weeks
5870612 notably apple will be launching iphone in 20 new countries on aug 22 and will be distributing through best buy starting on sept 7 which could drive further upside to our september quarter estimate
5870613 this is a known iphone bug that is being fixed in the next software update in september
5870614 apple has determined that in very rare cases batteries in first generation ipod nanos sold between sept 2005 and dec 2006 can overheat causing failure and deformation of the ipod nano
5870615 apple has received very few reports of such incidents less than 0
5870616 any first generation ipod nano customers who have experienced their battery overheating should contact applecare for a replacement any other customers who have concerns about their first generation ipod nano battery should also contact applecare

5870618 this the first of his signs jesus did at cana in galilee and manifested his glory and his disciples believed in him
5870619 now jesus did many other signs in the presence of the disciples which are not written in this book but these are written so that you may believe that jesus is the christ the son of god and that by believing you may have life in his name
5870620 our pastor doesnt proclaim to us what the bible says and means the messages are not revelations of the glory of christ they are advice talks with a religious twist
5870621 but we have renounced disgraceful underhanded ways we refuse to practice cunning or to tamper with gods word but by the open statement of the truth we would commend ourselves to everyones conscience in the sight of god
5870622 we have little hope in our lifetime to believe for a major enough cultural political and religious change to occur in our context such that muslims would become open to entering christianity on a wide scale

5870626 o reconhecimento dos rostos obtido sem esfor o por pessoas de todas as culturas diferentes e por isso era considerado como um mecanismo universal entre os humanos
5870627 no entanto o uso de uma nova tecnologia de imagem cerebral permitiu a descoberta de que as diferen as culturais fazem com que olhemos os rostos de forma distinta
5870628 demonstram que o processamento de rostos n o pode ser considerado como algo que surge de uma s rie universal de eventos perceptivos
5870629 a estrat gia empregada para extrair informa o visual dos rostos difere com as culturas
5870630 em uma s rie de estudos do movimento dos olhos mostramos que a experi ncia social tem um impacto sobre a forma como as pessoas olham os rostos
5870631 especificamente notamos uma grande diferen a nos movimentos dos observadores ocidentais e do leste da sia
5870632 descobrimos que os ocidentais tendem a olhar tra os espec ficos no rosto de um indiv duo tais como os olhos ou a boca enquanto que os observadores do leste da sia tendem a se focar no nariz ou no centro da face o que d uma vis o mais geral de todos os tra os
5870633 o excessivo contato visual direto pode ser considerado rude nas culturas do leste asi tico
5870634 aponta novos elementos para entender por que a comunica o n o verbal entre pessoas de culturas diferentes s vezes problem tica
5870635 as sociedades ocidentais s o em geral mais individualistas enquanto que as sociedades orientais s o coletivistas os ocidentais aparentemente pensam e percebem de maneira mais focalizada e os orientais globalmente
5870636 ao refutar a presun o tradicional de que o processamento de rostos realizado de uma maneira universal mostramos que o ambiente e inclusive a sociedade na qual nos desenvolvemos tem muita influ ncia nos mecanismos humanos b sicos

5870640 tracy and i were expecting the birth of our child on august 4 and tongue in cheek she asked tracy to hold on until the august 8 and give her the best 60th birthday present ever
5870641 when august 4 came and went we all started to think that this might actually be a possibility but in the meantime we had organised a surprise 60th party for her
5870642 on the night of august 7 at about 10 30pm tracy went into labour we managed to get up to the hospital and after a few hours our beautiful baby daughter zara was born
5870643 so jadee went from totally dreading her 60th birthday to having the best 60th birthday present a nana could ever wish for
5870644 before our daughter was born everyone told us that 8 8 08 was supposed to be the luckiest day in the calendar but never in my wildest dreams did i expect it to be such an important and special day and one that none of our family will forget for the rest of our lives
5870645 they know you are there and it gives them peace
5870646 ya i am so excited i am routing for natalie pailin
5870647 oh yeah you can watch it on brians official website along with all of his other commercials you can watch at http www brianthomassmith com oh and i absolutely love his heinikin commercial you no the one with jen aniston i watch it all the time over and over
5870648 ya i am pretty sure it is true if you go on the amazing race asia message board and ask around or look around you will find the answer
5870649 file quietly into your form lines come on you know what to do
5870650 andys fine were both fine m malum found us explain later
5870651 in light of the fire and for your own safety the headmaster has decided to end school early so that we can get you all home safely as soon as possible
5870652 the bus companies have been notified and transport will be arriving very shortly those of you who live nearby are advised to go straight home please for goodness sake dont hang around or go anywhere near the fire i should hope youre all smarter than that
5870653 but we need to get to the church right now
5870654 well ollie and i had been talking in one of the old science classrooms
5870655 so were on high alert then stuff started falling from the shelves and we knew we were right
5870656 it just so happened that the stupid science teacher who used to own the room left a lighter in the desk drawer
5870657 malum got it out and set alight to a stack of books before ripping the key out of the lock and flinging it out of the closed window he disappeared and we were trapped
5870658 oh er malum locked it i thought i said that
5870659 anyway we managed to escape by smashing the window with a desk and climbing out but not before id warned you guys of course i hoped that wherever you were in the school itd catch your eye
5870660 he knows where we go to school its only a matter of time before he follows us home and burns our houses down no crucifix can save us from that
5870661 if youre up there please let the rest of your kind know that were in danger malums discovered where we go to school and were going to need protection there now
5870662 oh and as an extra precaution we might need to be watched going home from school as well
5870663 the good ghosts are the best protection were going to get they should be able to hold off malum for a while if he tries to get to any of us hes powerful as a spirit in terms of being able to move objects easily but whenever a ghost on ghost clash occurs it all comes down to the physical strength they possessed in life ive heard malum was quite pudgy and weak whereas we have a few old miners on our side and trust me theyre pretty strong
5870664 hang on its quite dark outside now do you reckon you could walk tabby home
5870665 dean im not trying to judge you just let me
5870666 for gods sake dean wont you just shut the hell up for once and listen to me
5870667 i highly doubt theyre there for the same reason mine are
5870668 i can find my own way back im not a child
5870669 i dont know why i even agreed to walk you in the first place

5870675 hmmm killing muslims yes i can see the satire in this
5870676 when one enters the deeper layers of contemplative prayer one sooner or later experiences the void the emptiness the nothingness the profound mystical silence an absence of thought
5870677 fasting and prayers study and service submission and solitude confession and worship meditation and silence
5870678 if scripture does not direct us in our inquiries after god we immediately turn vain in our imaginations

5870686 if we win the grey cup ill probably have 1 000 1 000
5870687 thats what matters to me winning every game if we win every game and i get that then so be it if we win grey cup and i dont get it then again so be it
5870688 the fact is he can protect he can make good plays with his legs and then he can come out of the backfield and make some awesome plays with his hands
5870689 hes an all around back that takes our offence to another level
5870690 hes a terrific player and a big part of what we do
5870691 theres a trust factor between avon and the guys blocking for him
5870692 they work very hard together theyre a co ordinated group in terms of their sense for each other
5870693 but i want it the football any way i can get it
5870694 its tough its really tough because we have so many different routes that he runs and they dont know what hes going to do
5870695 were going to look for the matchups and take advantage of them when we can
5870696 the bye comes at a great time because we need the rest
5870697 it cost me x amount to make this game plus id like a little bit of profit
5870698 you can recycle all sorts of goods at forthbank not just glass paper and plastic but also electrical items phones books drinks cartons and even bikes

5870702 id like to say im sorry i didnt mean to do it
5870703 cuando se vio cercado baj la cabeza se entreg y no opuso ninguna resistencia

5870707 estaba preocupado hasta te llam al celular por si te hab a pasado algo y encima no contestaste
5870708 had no choice but to enter into the settlement in order to avoid further incarceration
5870709 if this stands this single handedly undermines the entire civil judicial process in this country
5870710 este grupo se va a encargar de verificar si los problemas persisten para luego tomar la decisi n de bajar o no el nivel del embalse
5870711 la idea de crear este grupo se tom hace un par de semanas en un encuentro anterior que tuve con mis pares argentinos

5870716 she holds generally left wing beliefs with foreign policy perspectives forged during the vietnam war she does not trust those outside the small circle in labour and her chief of staff heather simpson is known as the second most powerful person in new zealand known as h2
5870717 it cost me x amount to make this game plus id like a little bit of profit

5870721 the problem with software development is that there is too much ambiguity in the problem statement and in the design description things will go better if we get people to work with mathematical formalisms
5870722 the problem lies in the training things will go better if we start training students in the necessary mathematics earlier i e secondary school
5870723 under what circumstances and with what assignment should a formal specialist be called in
5870724 the problem is that the people are still drawing at the whiteboard things will go better if we give them special tools so that they can draw directly into the computer and give them early execution of their designs
5870725 no thanks we actually like drawing on the whiteboards we dont want to take the time to put the drawings into the computer um may we use the drawing editor portion of your tool suite
5870726 it slows me down i wont make the schedule if i use it

5870730 what are the characteristics of people that affect software development and what are their implications on methodology design
5870731 dont give me more than 4 people thats all i can get into one room and talking together
5870732 make sure there are whiteboards and coffee corners all over the building
5870733 if you give a dog a bad name you might as well shoot him
5870734 there are people not cogs inside the box people can do similar things repeatedly but never the same thing with a step by step process we expect the same set of outputs from identical inputs but peoples reaction to inputs may vary considerably from day to day based on a wide variety of conditions many of them unrelated to the task at hand
5870735 how can i manage the flood of paper that comes into my office
5870736 its easy keep your desk entirely clean with four baskets on one side and a set of folders in the top drawer
5870737 we are not short on practices we are short on practice
5870738 psp is extremely rigorous and if no one is asking for my data its easier to do it the old way
5870739 make it simple and clear we can add that subtlety later
5870740 all code is public any pair of people sitting together may change anything
5870741 a few good people stepped in at key moments and did whatever was needed to get the job done
5870742 perhaps most important for the long term during the course of the project a capable core team for rapid development of gn amp c systems evolved this included finding talented team members training in and gaining experience with the tools processes and methodology and integrating into a cohesive team after working together in the rdl for a year team members have acquired expertise in methods tools and domain a helpful and cooperative atmosphere has encouraged and enabled cross training a willingness on the part of team members to address any and all project issues has proven invaluable on many occasion
5870743 just have it store the phone numbers of the people working on each part ill call them and find out

5870754 olcc staff counseled mr becken in december 2004 and may 2006 about illegal drug activity on the premises
5870755 the fact that he personally participated in five instances of drug activity on the licensed premises within a two week period shows an unwillingness or inability to obey the laws regarding unlawful drug activity
5870756 bye bye beckens or where to get your fix tonight
5870757 hey digg id like to take some questions from the digg community with me to the democratic and republican conventions submit a question in the comment section below ill ask the newsmakers and politicians some of your questions in my online coverage from both cities and during a live webcast from cbs news and cnet thanks katie
5870758 until now it was generally assumed that the hesc colony formation was pivotal for maintaining pluripotency
5870759 but we show that pluripotency can be retained independent of close cell cell contact
5870760 his work is certainly an important step forward in both understanding signal transduction pathways in stem cells and in the development of an improved methodology for culturing stem cells
5870761 we found that the growth of the hescs under this novel culture condition was almost identical to the growth of hescs on matrigel coated culture plates with no compromise in pluripotency
5870762 our research goal is to understand the basic mechanisms underlying unique biological functions of pluripotent stem cells and to translate the obtained knowledge into future medical applications
5870763 our next step is to produce new animal free ips cell lines
5870764 when i had no work i got so sick and bored
5870765 but now im learning a new skill i like it here
5870766 recently we discovered that grapefruit and these other fruit juices substantially decrease the oral absorption of certain drugs undergoing intestinal uptake transport
5870767 the concern is loss of benefit of medications essential for the treatment of serious medical conditions
5870768 im sure well find more and more drugs that are affected this way
5870769 determining the degree of stenosis or how much the artery has narrowed is insufficient to predict patient risk
5870770 we know that the majority of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events occur in patients whose blood vessels are less than 70 percent narrowed
5870771 patients with a reduction in gsm levels from their baseline ultrasound to the follow up ultrasound exhibited a significantly increased risk for near future adverse event compared to patients with increasing gsm levels
5870772 currently the hospitals use a standard test to work out how far the cancer has progressed and then they use this to determine the treatment the patient should receive however we are potentially able to more accurately predict who would benefit from chemotherapy
5870773 we now aim to carry out more work in this area to develop a prognostic tool which we hope will eventually be for widespread use by the health services in the treatment of bowel cancer
5870774 we have a very high number of patients with bowel cancer in the north east of england in particular we know the best treatment for very early and very late disease but there are still a lot of unknowns in between these two extremes
5870775 chemotherapy can be very useful but can have a number of side effects so we only want to use it where we think theres a good chance it will help this test will help us determine that
5870776 there is a desperate need for more effective treatments for bowel cancer the problem is identifying which cancers need which treatments this discovery may show us the way to do that and help save a lot of lives
5870777 our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter
5870778 the ou initiative is the only major u s initiative of its kind devoted to the problem of biodeterioration and biocorrosion
5870779 first we have to understand how mother nature cleans up these spills and we can do this by studying the way microorganisms interact with hydrocarbons
5870780 we want to better understand how organisms eat through these pipelines several fundamental mechanisms cause this contact jana smith jana smith ou edu 405 325 1322 university of oklahomasource eurekalertproblem but it is spotty and doesnt occur all of a sudden rather biocorrosion occurs over a long period of time and we are using a series of new molecular and chemical tools to find out why and how this happens
5870781 we think cells grow in communities that adhere to the inner surface of pipelines and form three dimensional biofilms that can sometimes cause pitting once we understand what these microorganisms are doing we can interrupt their processes or diagnose them more effectively the science is rudimentary at this stage the modern tools of molecular microbiology have not been applied yet but a national science foundation grant support from the does joint genome institute and the cooperation of the energy industry allowed us to study pipeline biocorrosion on the north slope
5870782 for many years no one ever thought anaerobes could grow by metabolizing hydrocarbons in the absence of oxygen but that is simply wrong
5870783 it is unfair that some individuals seek to reduce their tax by shifting their income to someone else so that it can be taxed at a lower rate
5870784 they put their heart and soul into it and they work long hours and yes maybe on paper one would appear to have more influence over the business than the other but in reality they talk about it and they share it and talk about the various issues they face in work at home
5870785 its a labour of love for them and this is a tax thats just going to make it that much more difficult for family businesses to survive
5870786 ill be outside the entry ask at the podium for the meetup if youre late
5870787 i love this so much i may never cut into it
5870788 ive used this in three projects already and im not even a little bit sick of it
5870789 we did some early down stuff we finished up the practice with some two minute work on both sides we keep installing defensively and were still putting in a couple new things there and the same with the offense
5870790 we want to play a lot of guys too were developing our depth were going to rotate our guys nothing is really solidified yet some of them are more set than others but theres still some good competition going on
5870791 our captains are probably going to be on a game by game basis thats what i believe in but its still up in the air and its something well talk about with the unity council
5870792 mccain views this as the one decision that he has total utter nonnegotiable control over
5870793 sen mccain is expected to host a rally on august 29 in dayton and is looking for a big venue and for a big crowd hell get it this is not yet public i guess i just made it so
5870794 radio is an afterthought im focusing on a viral approach word of moth
5870795 the men and women of the vfw know the value of freedom because you have been its protectors you were there when your country needed you you shouldered heavy burdens and accepted great risks im sure many of you will also recall from your experiences in war as i do from mine that when youre somewhere on the other side of the world in the service of america you pay attention to the news from back home it affects morale and even during this election season with sharp differences on the wisdom and success of the surge in iraq americans need to speak as one in praise of the men and women who fight our battles they are the best among us as you were before them and i know you will join me in applauding the courage and skill that will see america through to victory
5870796 put your hands down my pants and i bet youll feel nuts
5870797 a light will shine through that window a beam of light will come down upon you you will experience an epiphany and you will suddenly realize that you must go to the polls and vote for obama
5870798 it was an amazing feeling my dad had fixed it up for me i think it cost a fiver
5870799 he probably trains the hardest of anybody and hes very strict with himself but hes also a good guy he can turn off the competitive thing now and then and have a good laugh hes an inspiration
5870800 hes only human and hes got strengths and weaknesses well maybe not weaknesses maybe just weaker strengths but every time you do a personal best in training he gets up and beats it
5870801 you have to be very very careful about when you eat and when you rest
5870802 you get as much sleep as you can and you remind yourself that your opponents are having to do exactly the same as you so when youre tiring theyre tiring as well
5870803 i think the older you get the smarter you get you know the signs your body gives ive got stronger over the years ill have to take my foot off the gas pedal a little bit next year and try and build up for the london olympics but i feel very positive and im lucky i love what i do
5870804 i wouldnt be standing here with any medals round my neck if the meadowbank velodrome hadnt existed so who knows how many potential future olympic champions are out there why not built more facilities rather than knocking them down its about getting kids on bikes and into sport
5870805 what separates poetry from religious dogma is the ability of a poem to speak across time to everyone no matter their world view
5870806 the college has in place effective learning and teaching processes
5870807 the college is managing well and improving the quality of its services for learners
5870808 the most notable benefits of the programme were the increase in responsibility commitment confidence and aspiration of learners who responded well to the demands of a real life learning experience and participated enthusiastically in their activities
5870809 this report is a significant endorsement for the college and the findings are testament to the hard work of all staff culture of teamwork and commitment to learners
5870810 hmie review is a rigorous and comprehensive process carried out by a very experienced professional team
5870811 to receive such a ringing endorsement for our approach and services to learners has made us all feel very proud at the heart of the good work is the enthusiasm and commitment of staff its great to see this recognised
5870812 to achieve the best review of any scottish college just three years after forth valley college was created is quite an accomplishment
5870813 we strive to introduce sector leading and innovative practice in all subject areas so it is especially pleasing to have had that work acknowledged by hmie
5870814 we will now continue to maintain and improve on the high standards we have set to ensure all learners are provided with the best possible environment to help them achieve the qualifications skills and knowledge required for their chosen career paths
5870815 provided staff with very effective direction and support within a strong culture of aspiration innovation and accountability
5870816 are faith in science and faith in religion the same thing
5870817 we need engineers and scientists who can get ideas out of lab into the marketplace
5870818 for the past several months we have communicated our legal concerns with the site and repeatedly tried to work with them to have illegal content taken down muxtape was hosting copies of copyrighted sound recordings without authorization from the copyright owners making these recordings available for streaming playback also requires authorization from the copyright owners muxtape has not obtained authorization from our member companies to host or stream copies of their sound recordings
5870819 currently the hospitals use a standard test to work out how far the cancer has progressed and then they use this to determine the treatment the patient should receive however we are potentially able to more accurately predict who would benefit from chemotherapy
5870820 we now aim to carry out more work in this area to develop a prognostic tool which we hope will eventually be for widespread use by the health services in the treatment of bowel cancer

5870827 its obviously worrying people either cant borrow or dont want to borrow even if they can
5870828 there are always short term blips but over the long run m3 has repeatedly shown itself good leading indicator
5870829 our clients were incensed by the level of illegal downloading in the first 14 days since topware interactive released dream pinball 3d it sold 800 legitimate copies but was illegally downloaded 12 000 times hopefully people will think twice if they risk being taken to court
5870830 my new employer lets me list the ip i own before i joined the company so whats the big deal
5870831 all cs jobs are going to require me to sign away my ip
5870832 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
5870833 in a series of eye movement studies we showed that social experience has an impact on how people look at faces specifically we noticed a striking difference in eye movements in westerners and east asian observers we found that westerners tend to look at specific features on an individuals face such as the eyes and mouth whereas east asian observers tend to focus on the nose or the centre of the face which allows a more general view of all the features one possible cause of this could be that direct or excessive eye contact may be considered rude in east asian cultures
5870834 by disproving the long held assumption that face processing is universally achieved we have highlighted that the external environment including the society in which we develop is very influential in basic human mechanisms and caution should be taken when generalising findings to the entire human population
5870835 its one of those situations where the devil is in the details
5870836 have some humility in how we approach the issue of confronting evil

5870841 after very long discussions with them wpio i am proud to say that i have understood i accept that everybody who served me is free i am giving them one cow each and lands
5870842 victims of slavery have been routinely destroyed by sexual exploitation and other human rights abuses
5870843 more collective sacrifices and responsibility are needed for the interest of humankind to protect pygmies and the other poorest communities in the country
5870844 were living through a period of inflating prices and mortgages are no exception 0 64 per cent may not sound like a lot but over the course of the year households will need to find an extra 720 to keep up with the cost of homeownership
5870845 the bank of england can cut rates but as weve seen over the past year theres no guarantee this will translate into a lower true cost of mortgages at least in the short term
5870846 i had lost my career i lost my marriage i was in the doldrums for ten years after my defeat
5870847 la verdad me pregunto qu pasa veo la repetici n los comentarios primero digo que no me conocen y a partir de su desconocimiento hablan opinan y ver cualquier jugada en futbol en c mara lenta no tiene ning n punto de comparaci n con la realidad y mil sima de segundo en que se desarrolla cada movimiento de futbol
5870848 lo primero que se les ocurri decir es que si a horacio cervantes le dieron tres fechas a esta jugada tiene que ser m nimo tres o cuatro eso me da para pensar que tiene otro fondo no s lo la jugada que no miden s lo la intenci n miden todo el espect culo estamos acostumbrados a recibir golpes del mismo lugar
5870849 esto es un negocio son dos televisoras importantes que siempre est n disput ndose cosas extrafutbol sticas en medio estuvo la expulsi n de cervantes no s quien present el video o c mo se lleg a la determinaci n de que le dieran tres fechas
5870850 hay cosas que me tiene podrido y van a seguir sucediendo no s lo conmigo con otros jugadores y hay que acostumbrarse esta disputa como jugador por momentos me tiene cansado pero es parte de lo que vivimos
5870851 en el futbol mexicano suceden cosas que no pasan en otro futbol me tengo que adaptar
5870852 respetando su autoridad y tratando de fundamentar nuestra solicitud en juicio siempre apegado a la raz n a la ciencia y al bien de todos
5870853 no estamos promoviendo una pol mica porque ser a lo menos recomendable en este momento pero tampoco una confrontaci n sino un llamado a la sensatez a la prudencia y si se quiere a la jurisprudencia para que este asunto se resuelva con base en razones y con base a derecho
5870854 que nos quedemos ah por que hay causas por las que no se claudica y los ciudadanos tiene que luchar por el respeto a la vida
5870855 ive had a woman railing ranting crying and going on and on whilst i look on with keen but silent interest
5870856 he cant hear you your mom and dad left so i get to watch you
5870857 whats wrong julz you look a little frustrated why is that
5870858 because you had to go and turn me on and and oh shit
5870859 oh by the way were getting married you knew right
5870860 currently the experience is pretty crappy you have to click through an infobar to allow installation of this component then you have to click yes to say that you really want to run the native content and then you have to click yes again to allow the component to interact with content on the page
5870861 in theory with the right signatures the right security class implementations some eye of newt and a pinch of garlic its possible to get things down to a one time install which would make the component available everywhere
5870862 la tarea es coordinarnos en una misma l nea y la misi n es que el equipo califique de nueva cuenta
5870863 volver a casa en esta nueva etapa y en una nueva faceta implica retos y por eso estoy muy contento es para mi un sue o cumplido que de ser jugador del club ahora sea parte de la directiva
5870864 siempre ha tenido la posibilidad de ganar es uno de los m s importante del pa s y est a la altura de cualquera
5870865 i was talking to tom hicks and he told me we have the money we are not that far apart if we sell one or two players we have enough money to sign another good player
5870866 we have to be quicker i said this four years ago and im still thinking in those terms that way we can save more money and sign the targets we want in my opinion we arent doing all the things we need to do in terms of signing players

5870868 the arc of the moral universe is long but it bends toward justice
5870869 for other people to say things like that people wouldnt take it seriously but with barack people really did take him seriously they thought of him as someone who really sincerely believed it
5870870 remember at the time in chicago the wards were really politically motivated
5870871 if you werent onboard with the political process and people in leadership then your garbage didnt get picked up on time and your street didnt get fixed
5870872 politicians understand that the number of community residents that come out for a community meeting probably represent 10 times the number of votes
5870873 it might have been small victories to the outside world but to us it was big it meant those kids could get the jobs they could buy things to start back to school
5870874 we saw what could happen we saw what can be done if the community has the resources and somebody to come in and train them ill always be grateful for that
5870875 im a lot more of a hothead than barack is
5870876 barack is more for compromise you know hell wait and see
5870877 so i would say to myself ok im not really great at the high road because the road is already crumbling ok so i dont know if i can make the road higher
5870878 this is the only area of chicago where real transportation does not run to the city limits
5870879 we have a whole community thats isolated with no way to get to jobs
5870880 with sen obamas help we wound up getting president bush to sign the transportation bill allocating 580 million for the extension of the red line train
5870881 we may someday soon have a president in the white house who will listen to people like us
5870882 then maybe finally well have someone who will respond to our needs
5870883 i was a little nervous because i hadnt seen or talked to her in 14 years
5870884 everyone was making it out to be such a big deal that i think we both fell prey to having that affect us
5870885 once we were working it felt like a good fit
5870886 everybody was on pins and needles and sort of waiting to see how theyd react they started off kind of tentative but by the time we were five takes in they were giggling and seemed to be reconnecting
5870887 your lady will be stroked dumb by your sexual power
5870888 force them to realize who you really are with soft viagra

5870891 a rural radio component provides small farmers with vital information on which commodities to produce what technologies to use and how to price their crops radio programs teach farmers basic business skills such as bookkeeping how to conduct market research and plan for the future
5870892 from harnessing the power of technology to combat drug counterfeiting to using bicycles as a potent rural development tool this years youthactionnet fellows are true social entrepreneurs developing creative solutions to foster lasting social change
5870893 we offer our hearty congratulations to each of this years fellows who are working tirelessly to improve their local and global communities each took action to address a critical social challenge each successfully mobilized the public will and support needed to make a real difference in the lives of others

5870913 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
5870914 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
5870915 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
5870916 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade

5870939 the drop in instant access savings rates reflects banks efforts to encourage people to save for the long term they want to know they have money to play with and cant afford to offer as good deals to attract short term savings that can be withdrawn without penalty at a moments notice
5870940 this explains why there are still some great deals on offer in regular savings and fixed term bonds anyone who has some cash set aside could benefit significantly
5870941 having instant access to your cash is a genuine benefit but for many savers it means you have to watch the interest rate set by your bank carefully
5870942 with around one in eight instant access savings accounts paying under two per cent interest if you dont keep an eye out the banks will take full advantage

5870967 our main goal is to actually get a car free park and i believe we can do it
5870968 its really outrageous that children have to worry about crossing the street in a park because of cars coming
5870969 given all the pedestrian traffic we have in the park all the seniors all the children all the people jogging and on bicycles we cannot have cars driving 40 miles an hour in prospect park
5870970 its just a ticking time bomb really waiting for some serious injury or fatality
5870971 the park is not for you know cars the park was made for people to have fun and relax

5871070 in light of the statutory purpose of determining whether signers are qualified electors we find it difficult to see how a post office box address renders a signature invalid per se if an elections official can verify that the signer is a qualified elector
5871071 in some instances the election official may even have the post office box address on file
5871072 legislative clarification of the statutory requirements for signatures on candidate nominating petitions would be helpful to both candidates and election officials
5871073 how are they going to put a narrative in there on where they live
5871074 if saddam rejects peace and we have to use force our purpose is clear we want to seriously diminish the threat posed by
5871075 iraq is a long way from here but what happens there matters a great deal here for the risks that the leaders of a rogue state will use nuclear chemical or biological weapons against us or our allies is the greatest security threat we face
5871076 he will use those weapons of mass destruction again as he has ten times since 1983
5871077 w e urge you after consulting with congress and consistent with the u s constitution and laws to take necessary actions including if appropriate air and missile strikes on suspect iraqi sites to respond effectively to the threat posed by iraqs refusal to end its weapons of mass destruction programs saddam hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process
5871078 hussein has chosen to spend his money on building weapons of mass destruction and palaces for his cronies
5871079 we begin with the common belief that saddam hussein is a tyrant and a threat to the peace and stability of the region he has ignored the mandated of the united nations and is building weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them
5871080 we have known for many years that saddam hussein is seeking and developing
5871081 the last un weapons inspectors left iraq in october of 1998 we are confident that saddam hussein retains some stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons and that he has since embarked on a crash course to build up his
5871082 i will be voting to give the president of the united states the authority to use force if necessary to disarm saddam hussein because i believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security
5871083 there is unmistakable evidence that saddam hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years we also should remember we have always underestimated the progress saddam has made in development of weapons of mass destruction
5871084 he has systematically violated over the course of the past 11 years every significant un resolution that has demanded that he disarm and destroy his chemical and biological weapons and any nuclear capacity this he has refused to do
5871085 in the four years since the inspectors left intelligence reports show that saddam hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weap ons stock his missile delivery capability and his nuclear program he has also given aid comfort and sanctuary to terrorists including al qaeda members it is clear however that if left unchecked saddam hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons
5871086 we are in possession of what i think to be compelling evidence that saddam hussein has and has had for a number of years a developing capacity for the production and storage of weapons of mass destruction

5871088 it is my hope that reading these stories inspires some to plant their own seeds of change that when we see something wrong well do something about it whether that means writing to your representative in congress or researching a cure for a disease or simply speaking out against inequality and prejudice were all in this together and the first step toward change can begin with any one of us

5871261 the jonas brothers beat the beatles on 5 out of 6 criteria i use to judge bands
5871262 i lived through the beatles era and saw them perform live many times so i think ive earned the right to speak on the subject
5871263 first off there are three jonas brothers and there were four beatles the jonas brothers are outmanned yet they still come out ahead

5871313 since weve been writing about bigfoot so much this week a number of people have come forward to talk about this new creature who in a sense is terrifying many people in the town of green springs ohio
5871314 only its 10 000 times worse than a skunk smell
5871315 when i took my famous pic of bigfart i literally passed out and had to be revived with smelling salts after his odiferous attack
5871316 its 4 20 for them all day long if you catch my drift if they did see anything it is probably someones pet monkey which escaped or they got bored feeding it and let it loose in the woods
5871317 the monkey has probably been drinking water from the sulphur springs when he farts his emanations are much stronger than that of a normal monkey
5871318 no it is not a monkey or even a baboon its something completely different
5871319 one of these days im gonna bag bigfart and hold a press conference with the results of my science that will shut up the naysayers

5871338 run of river projects are dramatically different in design appearance and impact from conventional hydroelectric projects there are two main differences first there is no water storage other than the limited amount required to submerge the intake pipe second there is no alteration of downstream flows since all diverted water is returned to the stream below the powerhouse potential sites tend to exist at high altitudes characterized by features such as fast flows steep canyons waterfalls and other natural barriers these features reduce the suitability of such sites for potentially competing land uses such as recreation and most importantly limit fish presence and diversity british columbia is fortunate to have a large number of such sites particularly in the coastal mountain ranges run of river projects can be developed on appropriate sites with little if any negative impact on either aquatic or terrestrial habitat

5871354 es importante que los actores sociales empiecen a ver otras alternativas para iniciar un proceso de di logo entre el gobierno y las prefecturas pero estamos viendo que en ese nivel cada vez m s se van polarizando entonces creo firmemente que otros sectores deben comenzar a dar alternativas para que de una vez esa crisis y violencia que se est generando en nuestro pa s no siga profundiz ndose
5871355 los sectores que han sido marginados en la construcci n de los estatutos auton micos tienen que empezar a buscar una posici n para mostrar que no hay una sola idea en tarija que evidentemente los pueblos ind genas los campesinos los barrios periurbanos los gremiales y las grandes mayor as de marginados que todav a no han sido incluidos en toda esa discusi n puedan empezar a plantear unitariamente una propuesta para iniciar el di logo

5871383 i want to know whats your plan to utilize your pick as vice president
5871384 i wont hand over my energy policy to my vice president i wont have my vice president engineering my foreign policy for me
5871385 the buck will stop with me because ill be present
5871386 my vice president also by the way will be a member of the executive branch he wont be one of those fourth branches of government where he thinks hes above the law
5871387 i want somebody who has integrity who is in politics for the right reasons
5871388 somebody who is independent someone who is able to say to me mister president i think youre wrong on this and heres why
5871389 i want somebody who is capable of being president and who i would trust as vice president
5871390 who shares with me a passion to make the lives of the american people better than they are right now
5871391 i want somebody who is mad right now people are losing their jobs
5871392 knows where they came from and believes we have to grow this country from the bottom up
5871393 this whole notion that the democratic party is divided has been hyped by the media
5871394 this is how politics is supposed to be youre supposed to be passionate about your candidate
5871395 there always is going to be a certain portion of the population that you have to win over
5871396 i have to earn every single vote that i get and i want them to take a look at my track record
5871397 there is a strong drift toward the hard theological left some want to recast jesus as a limp wrist hippie in a dress with a lot of product in his hair who drank decaf and made pithy zen statements about life while shopping for the perfect pair of shoes in revelation jesus is a prize fighter with a tattoo down his leg a sword in his hand and the commitment to make someone bleed that is a guy i can worship i cannot worship the hippie diaper halo christ because i cannot worship a guy i can beat up i fear some are becoming more cultural than christian and without a big jesus who has authority and hates sin as revealed in the bible we will have less and less christians and more and more confused spiritually self righteous blogger critics of christianity
5871398 hey that whole closed communion thing takes serious liberty with the scripture
5871399 the whole alien immersion concept is silly and almost offensive

5871404 students have the ability to cause significant harm to the charlieticket system during the roughly five month window that remedial actions will require
5871405 invaluable but there are additional materials that cause us great concern
5871406 it wasnt to enable others to get a free fare or cause any sort of havoc
5871407 it was really to show how major the issues are in this system which also might resonate in many other systems around the world
5871408 crashing or what i hate most about my husbands cycling career
5871409 it aint the run of the mill curiousity seekers or bigfoot hunters you have to be worried about
5871410 its the professional big money bigfoot hunters that are the real cause for concern
5871411 hell thats the same amount of money you can get for catching osama bin laden only capturing bigfoot is a lot less dangerous
5871412 one day a guy came up with the idea of hunting for animals that werentt even proven to exist
5871413 new rich mostly chinese oil billionaires from the middle east and russia you know mostly guys that used to be considered villains before the push for globalization these guys have so much money in their hands that they can spend it all day long coming up with stupid and or evil ways to blow it its not like they will miss a few million dollars
5871414 yes i am convinced it had everything in the world to do with the death of bigfoot chuck now i dont know whitton and dyer personally but i know of someone who does know them he said neither of them boys is the sharpest tool in the shed if they tried hunting chuck they would probably have ended up dead i mean why the heck did they rename him rickmat anyone who looked at him for even one second would call him chuck
5871415 what i think happened is that a professional bigfoot bounty hunter is the one who bagged chuck chuck was real smart for a sasquatch keep in mind bigfoots have remained hidden since hector was a pup these two guys didnt catch him the pro must have been interrupted after he bagged chuck and then whitton and dyer came along found the body printed some t shirts and the rest is history
5871416 kebetulan diskusi dengan saya dia juga membaca sejumlah buku tentang islam
5871417 nessuna squadra anche perch io sono sotto contratto col piacenza fino a giugno 2009
5871418 s lavevo intuito circa da due mesi ovvero da quando il direttore sportivo castagnini aveva rescisso il contratto verso marzo era anche giusto cambiare visto che io ero legato a filo diretto col ds
5871419 il mio punto di riferimento era castagnini n riccardi n il presidente
5871420 beh non fa piacere finch vivi il periodo un conto ma quando incomincia il campionato la panchina ti manca noi siamo uomini di campo e senza il campo ti manca qualcosa
5871421 non lho seguito quindi non so se hanno fatto bene o male per me un capitolo chiuso
5871422 certamente una delle accreditate alla vittoria della serie b empoli e parma sono fra le favorite un gradino dietro brescia e livorno
5871423 la roma ha veramente molte chance porta avanti un certo tipo di lavoro ha preso baptista giocatore adattissimo a loro e possono mantenere molte soluzioni manterranno il solito gioco ma credo che tenteranno di sfruttarne anche un altro per qualche partita un po particolare
5871424 tre squadre allo stesso livello il milan non ha la champions la juventus ha unossatura collaudata da tempo oltre a una filosofia vincente data dalla storia e poi linter con lavvento di mourinho unincognita ovvero pu vincere tutto oppure fare male male
5871425 non me laspettavo e non me lauguravo perch un tecnico che stimo molto sia come persona che come allenatore pu avere commesso un piccolo errore con le dichiarazioni del dopopartita ma bisognava partire da quel punto per farlo crescere e per rafforzarlo ancora di pi mancini una persona di grande carisma credo sia stata una perdita
5871426 io non discuto dei giocatori per nelle grandi squadre bisognava vincere ma non solo bisogna anche giocare bene per questo linter deve ripartire da zero in italia quando si gioca contro una grande tenti di bloccare le fonti di gioco e a quel punto sei tu il primo a non creare e a non divertire poi magari vinci anche la partita
5871427 le rispondo per reparti certamente lattacco del milan atomico il gioco della roma che un po una mia creatura perch il 4 2 3 1 la mia filosofia e quindi il centrocampo ha qualcosa di consolidato da tempo e la difesa quella dellinter mi piace non facile dire mexes e non dire chiellini e riduttivo sono tutti grandissimi calciatori e lequilibrio sar importante
5871428 prandelli c gi riuscito a parma ma anche inizialmente a firenze dipende dalla forma dei giocatori perch quando si gioca ad albero di natale vuol dire col 4 3 2 1 normale che si privilegi un po di pi la fase difensiva e questo ti permette di avere pi continuit mentre col 4 2 3 1 sei molto pi offensivo quindi devi essere molto in forma per poterlo fare
5871429 io prima di privarmi di pasqual ci penserei bene perch oltre ad avere qualit un ragazzo doro e capace di entrare in partita in corso accetta panchina e tribuna senza polemiche se poi dovesse andare a napoli si troverebbe benissimo visto che lesterno sinistro manca agli azzurri e poi la piazza incredibile sarebbe un affare per tutti tranne per la fiorentina
5871430 risente della situazione economica perch non c chiarezza per i proventi delle varie societ e dei vari campionati in pi la finanza mondiale va a rilento con il risultato che i presidenti prima di spendere soldi ci pensano sono molto coperti quadrati non si lasciano andare a spese folli in pi c unoculatezza tra gli addetti ai lavori
5871431 secondo me non un colpo e un buon giocatore ma non ronaldinho ma non lo ritengo un calciatore che pu infiammare la piazza
5871432 gue putus dari donita dari pihak kita berdua memang kita lagi ada masalah
5871433 debate 2008 combined the vast veteran and military audiences of the american legion with approximately 2
5871434 never before has there been an online video q amp a between the presidential candidates that was focused on military and veterans issues
5871435 this is the first opportunity of its kind for servicemembers and veterans to ask questions of their future commander in chief
5871436 its not so much an apology that im making more to explain to you the anger that you saw yesterday you saw a display of anger in this courthouse there was some protocol issues that i was unhappy about
5871437 like the prosecutor i too am innocent if i am found guilty well then you should look at me maybe in a different way
5871438 its no longer a maori thing at the moment thats why i burned their church down

5871443 well little miss seamstress im just going to spread the word that you arent quite the seamstress you think you are
5871444 hey wait i never said i could sew well i just said i could and that you could borrow my machine
5871445 well its a good thing these are for eight year olds they probably wont notice
5871446 elegy is such a serious oftentimes grave exploration of desire and the ways of aging and desperate flesh that its a miracle the two central characters a literary star named david kepesh and his much younger lover consuela have as much sex as they do
5871447 the dying animal a brutal short novel by philip roth that oozes like a wound
5871448 human stain to the screen kepesh is cool and watchful and kingsley plays him without a trace of plausible weakness
5871449 elegy has the veneer of fealty it shares some of the books dialogue most of its plot points and characters a bold patricia clarkson plays kepeshs other lover peter sarsgaard his unhappy son and dennis hopper his only friend
5871450 elegy has nothing to do with faithfulness and everything to do with interpretation
5871451 the dying animal with its unloving encounters maddening woman troubles and occasional gynecological descriptions really cries out for a reckless voluptuary like catherine breillat who wouldnt go all soft
5871452 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5871453 every device we make is a microprocessor controlled device capable as serving as a node on a network
5871454 our devices generate information about how they are used and many of our new devices can be remotely activated by a local user or a user over a network to truly take advantage of these capabilities the software infrastructure becomes the glue that ties the hardware together think of the ipod itunes ecosystem that apple has developed
5871455 a tactical networkable computer that combines advanced audio video record capture capabilities with tactical communications
5871456 as our emerging technologies gain greater communication and computational capabilities the development of sophisticated software architectures and a fully integrated product roadmap are imperative strategic initiatives for taser international
5871457 i was talking to my host father the other day and he believes that the project could benefit the people of his village too hes in the technology area of one of the sub county governments and does a lot of field work with the people in his village including rainwater harvesting projects and other projects for development i have added a paypal donation button to the blog im hoping to raise some funds to expand the project to this area its about 30 usd for each pig since we want to give them 5 month old pigs so as to reduce the chance of them dying before they can produce the costs for the training materials have already been covered so as of now its just the cost of the pigs and if there are some funds left to cover transport for implementing and also evaluating in kasaali kyotera and anywhere else that it is implemented i would need only 12 pigs because the project grows and expands on its own as the pigs reproduce so thats 360
5871458 i used to give reacharounds to jack benny before you were born and that man had timing
5871459 will for the love of god someone please punch me in the face so i can see some stars
5871460 my only job is to make sure no more bigfoots end up on ice
5871461 since bigfoots are one of the most rare of all species i feel have a certain obligation to help them in any way i can the main oath i took i swore that i could never exploit or profit from these amazing lifeforms in any way
5871462 there is not an amount of money you could pay me high enough to sell out my bigfoot friends and those that do will have to live with the consequences but if you keep bringing people to bigfoots hiding place pretty soon there aint gonna be any bigfoot
5871463 you wouldnt believe me if i told you how many people were involved and you would be very surprised at some of the names i would mention if i was allowed to mention names which i am not the safety of the sasquatch is all that really matters personalities dont matter when you are dealing with extinction
5871464 havent you ever wondered why so many people have seen old bigfoot and why aint nobody been able to ever prove it with dna evidence
5871465 apple has determined that in very rare cases batteries in first generation ipod nanos sold between september 2005 and december 2006 can overheat causing failure and deformation of the ipod nano
5871466 as you may expect building and maintaining a secure mobile platform is a difficult task
5871467 while we have found and fixed many of our own bugs as well as flaws in other open source projects we realize that the discovery of additional security issues in a system this large and complex is inevitable
5871468 help from security researchers in the form of usable bug reports and responsible timelines will greatly assist us in securing the ecosystem of android devices as quickly as possible
5871469 i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes

5871475 la gente est muy afanado muy preocupada porque no ven sus casas construidas no ven que haya gente del gobierno para construir ha sido un proceso muy demorado de las personas que perdieron sus viviendas a causa del temblor algunas ya obtuvieron su subsidio de arriendo otras han tenido que acudir a alg n familiar que tenga su casita en buen estado otros han tenidos que volver a sus casas deterioradas mientras se habilitan albergues con servicios b sicos
5871476 luego de los estudios estamos pr ximos a iniciar en forma las labores de reconstrucci n material pero seguimos necesitando una ayuda a fondo el estimado para las casas nuevas es de diez millones de pesos pero nos siguen haciendo falta recursos porque una casa muy modesta con las normas sismo resistentes puede alcanzar los 16 millones de pesos

5871480 as a high luxury brand we are representing europe to the world we are a species to protect
5871481 we want a strong outcome for the environment but we dont want the rules to disproportionately disadvantage small volume and niche manufacturers many of which are in the uk
5871482 we are committed to reduce co2 emissions heavily in the next years so we are doing whatever is possible without destroying the dna of the brand to bring them down to a much better level than today but you have to understand it will never meet the 120 g or 130 g per kilometer required
5871483 porque acha necess rio o executivo se envolver no assunto
5871484 its been there for at least three to four years
5871485 sidewalks are the threads that physically weave our neighborhoods together without them we lose touch with the greater community around us
5871486 ive almost gotten to the point where im ready to sacrifice myself and break my leg so that i can get money from the city and give it to people to fix these things
5871487 at that rate its a 400 year plan to fill in all the sidewalks in the city
5871488 its a sidewalk for dummies guide in a good way because were all dummies when it comes to getting a sidewalk
5871489 if youre working one or two full time jobs and trying to make ends meet youre not going to have time to do that
5871490 the majority of people are not even aware that such a process exists and wouldnt know how to go about it
5871491 it was an area that was considered one of the worst neighborhoods in seattle
5871492 we cant be selfish about this we need to look at where the need is the greatest or pedestrian safety is at risk

5871509 who do you think killed chuck i guess the autopsy might just show up details that nobody wants anyone to know the person or group who killed chuck are dangerous because he was the gentlest pet i ever had i expect a cover up of mammoth proportions before this thing is over

5871518 the oig did not address the scientific merits of highly questionable research and therefore cannot rightfully claim that funding and support of the research was appropriate

5871520 he did not collect data or maintain pi files on the study participants
5871521 failure to collect data or maintain individual case files could interfere with the ability of the study to contribute to generalizeable knowledge which is the definition of research

5871531 nobodys ever pretended that this was anything but a tragic accident its just a matter of meeting with him hes always been willing to accept responsibility for his actions
5871532 this is the best feeling in the world its awesome
5871533 sometimes i need something to boost my determination to get to that next level and thats what happened i would have liked to have shot 25 and won the gold outright but i couldnt have asked for a better shoot off
5871534 i was hoping that he was going to draw first in the shoot off i like shooting second just so i can have the pressure on myself and not have to put the pressure on anybody else i like to deal with the pressure and this time it paid off
5871535 i was hoping that he wouldnt miss because tore and i are really good friends but when it comes down to it im glad i got the gold medal
5871536 i wasnt expecting him to miss that soon it just panned out for me i saw the targets really well those two pairs and i crushed them
5871537 hes right there among the best in the world it was just which one of us had the better day today and it turned out to be me
5871538 i knew that if i was going to have a chance for the gold i needed to hit 25 maybe 26 vincent is a great shooter and a great friend but i dont see the silver as a failure i won the silver
5871539 i was trying to keep everything out of my mind actually
5871540 i was just trying to keep it focused on the gold medal and seeing myself up on the podium in the first place just visualizing perfection and i almost had it i missed the low six again but it doesnt matter i still won
5871541 i could feel the nervousness building up inside of me so i hoped it wasnt taking too much longer
5871542 im obviously a very nervous person i cant sit still very often i pace around when im shooting that helps me calm down i try to take the anxiousness and nervousness and turn it around into energy that i can focus on my shooting
5871543 i cant ask for anything more than perfection i try to be a perfectionist as much as possible because my motto is if youre perfect nobody can beat you so perfection rules
5871544 it wont sink in for a couple of days probably but once it does its going to be
5871545 all those things were just stepping stones to this point right now

5871560 this is one of the most significant new pieces of eu environmental law of the last few years
5871561 more than a year after the deadline it is high time it was transposed
5871562 whats particularly worrying is that huge amounts of the food and cotton we consume are grown in drier areas of the world where water resources are either already stressed or very likely to become so in the near future
5871563 we are already in discussion with wwf about our decisions about where to grow crops in the future
5871564 from our point of view weve got to look at where our growers are going to get their water from
5871565 there are massive challenges with water in places like murcia southern spain we have to look at least 10 years ahead in terms of security of supply murcia will have to look very different in five years time
5871566 well have to look at new desalination technologies and we may have to look at crops that can cope with more saline conditions such as broccoli we take tomatoes out of morocco in winter and weve looked very hard at moroccan water but its complex if you use more greenhouse production here it uses more energy peas and beans are a steady all year market weve got to think about how we get them here in a responsible manner
5871567 what do you think is the most important legal issue facing the industry this year
5871568 when you think of slick high end fetish with great production values marquis and peter czernich are among the first names that come to mind
5871569 when we built kinkondemand com we wanted to offer the very best fetish material in the world
5871570 marquis has helped define the face of fetish fashion and eroticism for 20 years these are premium european videos that have been difficult for fans in north america to get
5871571 what do you think is the most important legal issue facing the industry this year

5871578 remember that fuzzy static between channels on the old tvs today more than three quarters of those radio airwaves or white space spectrum are completely unused
5871579 so if you agree that freeing the white spaces represents a vote for the future of the internet please sign our petition and help spread the word about this campaign
5871580 today america is squandering one of its most valuable natural resources the radio airwaves or spectrum which surround us and help us to communicate with one another
5871581 the u s government is in charge of dividing up this spectrum
5871582 unfortunately over the years weve ended up with a complicated inefficient system for assigning it and vast amounts of valuable spectrum simply go unused
5871583 and when tv stations cease analog transmission in february 2009 even more channels will be empty leaving between 12 and 40 unused channels in each u s broadcast market this unused spectrum could be used to bring fast wireless internet service to more americans revolutionizing the way we think of broadband internet access
5871584 what do you think is the most important legal issue facing the industry this year
5871585 the economic case for auctions as a tiebreaking mechanism for resolving contention among identical or confusingly similar applications for new gtlds
5871586 there are two lines of argument for auctions as the tie breaking mechanism for resolving contention among competing applicants for new generic tld strings first auctions accomplish the goal of allocative efficiency putting scarce resources into the hands of those who value them the most
5871587 alternative allocation mechanisms such as comparative evaluations and lotteries inherently have much more severe limitations and defects as evidenced by the historical record and by the abandonment of these alternatives in other communications areas
5871588 various devices to be considered for favoring disadvantaged bidders in an auction
5871589 would be viewed as equivalent to a 400 000 bid from a wealthy country
5871590 what do you think is the most important legal issue facing the industry this year
5871591 panama city officials began their persecution of joe francis with open deception continued with perjury and concluded with illegal imprisonment
5871592 that may be what counts for justice in panama city but its not american justice
5871593 i was released 11 months later but only after i was extorted by the judge to pay his former law partners a multimillion dollar ransom thats not justice and thats not the american way

5871602 we should vote because we cannot say with certainty that the future practices of the president will be those we cannot condone
5871603 is the best form of solidarity with the disenfranchised to sit the election out or is it to ask your nanny who cannot vote because she is not a citizen and the janitor who empties your office trash can who cannot vote because he was incarcerated who they would vote for and then cast a vote on their behalf
5871604 electing not to vote the ethics of lauren winners book review
5871605 oh yeah well people that use pseudonyms are always morons
5871606 when john mccain makes clear that he will keep us bogged down in the iraq war for years to come and barack obama makes clear that he is a voracious supporter of abortion on demand how can we really say that our act of casting in our lot with one of them does not morally implicate us in these actions and if it does how can we participate in it regardless of whatever good things might come from their presidency

5871625 im a professional business manager i have a staff of more than a dozen i have worked for many high profile actors musicians and multi million dollar corporations why would i steal from rihanna i showed her all the paperwork and tried to explain to her the circumstances but she wouldnt listen she called me all sorts of horrible names and stormed off i now feel compelled to share with the world the background story as i will not allow my name to be slandered
5871626 def jam doesnt fund rihanna properly so marc uses the money rihanna makes from third party endorsements and from tours to fund her album and music videos
5871627 since 2005 rihanna has been sponsored by the likes of jc penny samsung covergirl secret venus breeze etc and has gone on two major tours most recently label mate kanye wests
5871628 her record label def jam has put out 3 albums in a time span of 2 years a lot of that was orchestrated through her management rebel one it was never def jams intention to release so many albums back to back but marc jordan found loop holes and ways to make it happen a lot of the money rihanna made was through her endorsements between covergirl cosmetics samsung notice that majority of rihannas videos have a cell phone in it
5871629 after the release of rihanna and teairra mari def jam had the intention to drop both acts because their album sales were not successful
5871630 this brought the hype back for rihanna in the companys new york office the majority of the official s o s video was funded by samsung because the record label was only willing to put up a small amount once s o s picked up digitally and at radio def jam agreed to fund the rest of her album jordan instantly got a video shot to unfaithful he negotiated with video director anthony mandler to drop his price and would be given more videos from rihanna in return
5871631 then they shot we ride which was an extremely cheap video to create break it off was released as a third album but again def jam was unhappy with the sales of her album a girl like me and refused to shoot a video
5871632 at this point rihanna was opening up for the pussy cat dolls in europe she was making 30 000 a show but she didnt see any of that money because it was needed to fund her next album
5871633 when the albums first week numbers came in at less than 150 000 the label was shocked
5871634 jordan was noticing that dont stop the music was picking up so he persuaded the label to support it at radio in the u s and the remaining singles and they did then came for the repackaging of her album
5871635 take a bow was bought through her money the video was created with her money and so is her most recent video and single disturbia the label didnt even want to pay a dime for anything close to 750 000 was spent on those two songs alone and now she expects to see money in her account
5871636 all of it was spent on making her as big as she is now

5871681 they will not signal privatization of the va and they will not replace any scheduled expansion of the va network including those facilities designed to serve veterans living in rural and remote areas

5871701 emerge as a profound issue for our generation in britain
5871702 there are so many local water crises globally and when that comes together with climate change and population growth we are setting ourselves up for a real fall
5871703 people didnt realise what impact they would have on food and food prices weve had discussions with big retailers about water but because its not a globally traded commodity i dont think most have grasped the enormity of what is going on in their supply chains and the impact of drought on prices will they actually change them we have to ask are we exporting drought

5871707 because of the public nature of this job i probably havent allowed myself any of the emotional content
5871708 at 7 oclock tonight or 2 oclock tomorrow afternoon im going to be hit with a 2 by 4
5871709 im amused when people say i knew it was the right time i love what im doing i have no idea if its the right time but i do know that there are a lot of other things that havent been attended to that id like to give my attention to
5871710 this has been a wonderful decade of ud mens college basketball
5871711 and the last couple years across the board in athletics we really have stepped up were a comprehensive program thats getting stronger ted has set a solid foundation and tim will build on that
5871712 i feel i was handed the baton and did a few laps around the track and i feel were handing it off a little ahead
5871713 having been left out of the great midwest for good reason heres this once very proud program and their peers dont even want them
5871714 there are those who say we never should have left the mcc and they would prove their point by what happened in the great midwest i would argue that as much as a disaster as our performance in the great midwest was it held a mirror up to how far behind we were and that business as usual the old way wasnt going to get it done
5871715 i chose rather than to take a celebratory tone to say wake up everybody
5871716 the darkest days were when we were without a league but what does ted do he doesnt mope he doesnt sulk he rolls up his sleeves and goes to work diplomatically and politically and gets us into the atlantic 10
5871717 that was a big big win right there we had some big wins on the court but thats as important as any win we had
5871718 but im even more proud of what weve done where we had no history and tradition like womens volleyball where were playing in the ncaa tournament and going 33 2 and womens soccer the places where we said lets get after it in a few more sports thats where i feel proud
5871719 if you evaluate leadership by the performance of the people under his watch hes done just an unbelievable job
5871720 the success on the fields and courts of his teams the success of the student athletes in the classroom the impact athletes and coaches have made in the community its a dramatic change and its all come under teds leadership
5871721 personally we have a great relationship he means the world to me its been great to me as ive started my career as a head coach hes a tough guy to say good bye to

5871724 success in rowing sailing and track cycling can essentially be bought by siphoning off money from the public purse and handing it to the athletes who are then able to train like professionals success in sport like in the agricultural market is easier when it receives huge state subsidies

5871756 the totality of the research on cocoa flavanols is impressive this is just one more study adding to an increasing body of literature connecting regular cocoa flavanol consumption to blood flow and vascular health improvements throughout the body
5871757 though more research is needed these findings raise the possibility that flavanol rich cocoa products could be developed to help slow brain decline in older age
5871758 the message on the letter was very direct and threatening so the staff immediately dialed 911
5871759 the reaction of everybody was to leave the area leave it alone call 911 they took precaution to wash off what powder it was i think most peoples reaction would be to think that its something innocuous but you just have to be sure
5871760 anytime there is a threat and also some type of powder we have to be very cautious and error on the side of safety thats what prompted bringing in all these agencies together because we just dont know we want to be ahead of the curve in case it turns out to be something
5871761 i hope the authorities are able to track down the source of the letter i dont think its helpful to the process south dakota voters are going through and i dont think its part of the process of selecting u s senators it seems absurd to have to say that i think its an aberration and i hope its proven to be so

5871765 we could lower their homocysteine values and thus we thought also we could lower their risk for having further heart attacks and related disease
5871766 although we lowered homocysteine by almost one third it did not seem to have any beneficial effects
5871767 our findings might imply that homosycteine does not change the course of coronary artery disease but is just a risk marker of increased risk in coronary artery disease patients

5871783 these conditions indicate the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt about the partys ability to continue as a going concern
5871784 the partys auditors have confirmed that the party is indeed a going concern the deficit of 22 000 occurred in a double election year when the demands of the partys campaign operation were significantly high
5871785 this is an entirely manageable deficit which the partys bankers have confirmed they will support
5871786 the scottish liberal democrats are already taking steps to improve our long term income position
5871787 the only way we can do this is by offering distinctive policies choice and image that people can buy into both in terms of membership and party donations
5871788 we need to put this in perspective its not a major problem but it would be better if our books balanced on the right side rather than the wrong one
5871789 not only are polls showing that the scottish liberal democrat leadership contenders are invisible to the public but it looks like the eventual successor to nicol stephen may even inherit an invisible party
5871790 it further underlines the blunder they made in taking to the back benches in a huff after last years holyrood election

5871951 next up we want to simplify the user experience by allowing single password access to windows ldap and chart links applications finally we expect to dramatically reduce the volume of help desk calls regarding password resets
5871952 to enable chart links to provide its customers the means to secure access to sensitive data and meet the security requirements of hipaa and other initiatives is gratifying

5871959 youd have to talk to every one of the 10 072 election jurisdictions across the country

5871965 sometimes it is difficult to know what a politician will actually do once in office because they say different things at different times to different people
5871966 this is a particular problem when a candidate has a short thin record on the issues as in the case of sen obama
5871967 this argument is not about shots to the moon or specific missions in space
5871968 this is a lot more about the economic side of the space program and the high tech high paying jobs that it creates
5871969 while im pleased the issue of space exploration is getting attention from our presidential candidates
5871970 sen mccains record of unwavering support for nasa speaks louder than obamas newfound appreciation for the space program
5871971 cultivate support for americas space program and increase much needed funding
5871972 america benefits when important issues like nasa are debated in a public forum
5871973 we have an interest in economic development and i feel the federal government can assist the navajo nation in its efforts
5871974 i emphasized the need to work with the navajo nation on issues important to the navajo people such as significantly increasing funding for multi use court and law enforcement facilities
5871975 make a major announcement tomorrow which will include a name
5871976 theres a lot on the line for a bunch of players
5871977 we have a lot of depth chart decisions unsettled we have to firm up which true freshmen will play aug 30 we need to see what younger guys are ready to go now and which ones need more work were going to take a long look at this tape
5871978 its our dress rehearsal well dress up in game gear warm up like its game night well again go through a whole game day schedule so this is old hat next weekend
5871979 right now we look in good shape to get the banged up older guys back for game week but it opens the door for other guys to climb up the ladder
5871980 there are 12 regular season games and it wouldnt surprise me to see a dozen freshmen play this fall
5871981 right now theres a core group that we know will play and some other guys who could play very early others might move up as they get a better idea or if theyre needed we brought sterling endsley out of his redshirt in october last year and he was a major factor for us at tailback scoring three touchdowns i think we will see cases like that again we have some talented newcomers
5871982 the population really looks at us as handing out birth control pills and i cant deny that its a part of working with teens but the clinics are much more comprehensive than that
5871983 these days there are fewer and fewer clinics for the underserved to go to
5871984 we also do a lot of in school outreach to parents and families trying to hook them up with insurance maybe a parent isnt eligible for insurance because of a chronic illness but their kids might be
5871985 there will be a conversation over the next few weeks
5871986 insurance doesnt work as a source of funding because our clinics focus mostly on prevention
5871987 i am sick and tired of the president of the united states embarrassing me the world we live in is too complex to entrust it to someone else whose idea of intellectual curiosity and grasp of foreign policy issues is to tell us he can look into vladimir putins eyes and see into his soul
5871988 the race in iowa while relatively close appears to be moving in obamas direction
5871989 most importantly for obama his supporters are much more likely to say they strongly support him which makes them much more likely to turn out on election day and much more likely to talk to friends and neighbors volunteer in the campaign and do the kinds of things that win elections typically those who are less supportive are also less motivated to vote no matter how much they say ahead of time that theyll turn out to vote
5871990 while both candidates have secured their party bases the battle over independents continues in iowa
5871991 while independents are leaning more toward mccain at this time the substantial lead in democratic registration over republican in iowa means obama does not have to win independents to win iowa as long as he is winning 90 percent or more of democrats he does however have to keep things close
5871992 confidence in your candidate is another motivator to actually get out and vote
5871993 when you believe you will win its all the more reason to show up at the polls when you think you will lose its easier to not bother so again obama voters appear likely to be more motivated in november
5871994 barack obama is a black man will make it more difficult for friends and neighbors to vote for him
5871995 theres a substantial minority of voters concerned about the effects of race on the election
5871996 we cant directly ask voters if they are unwilling to vote for someone because of race but we can ask what they think others will do the fact that obama voters are much more concerned than mccain voters shows there is a fear among those who support obama that others will be less likely to support him because of his race mccain voters can safely say its not a worry because if its an issue their candidate will benefit
5871997 while many of those who express belief that race will make an obama vote more difficult think it will only be a little more difficult for their friends and neighbors to vote for him nearly a quarter of iowa voters see obamas race as a more significant stumbling block
5871998 of course we dont completely know their thoughts obama supporters are probably worried that their candidate will be hurt by his race and are projecting that worry on others
5871999 while many mccain supporters may agree it will be difficult for obama they would prefer to see their candidate win so if race does hurt obama its not as much a concern to them personally it seems clear though that race is a factor even if its hard to quantify
5872000 perceptions of obamas religion may turn out to be equally or more important than his race in the 2008 election especially among those who perceive him to be a muslim
5872001 iowa voters are similar to those in other states in terms of their likelihood of believing obama is muslim while mccain supporters are more likely to believe this we cannot necessarily draw the conclusion that they support mccain because of this belief mccain supporters may simply have no reason to learn obamas religion at the same time its certainly possible some of these voters support mccain because of their belief that obama is muslim
5872002 its very clear that voters who continue to support george bush will vote for john mccain
5872003 not only is this a simple continuation of partisan support but mccain is clearly associated with supporting much of the bush agenda and voters recognize the connection
5872004 the challenge for obama lies with independents who disapprove of bush while mccain has the support of more than 8 in 10 bush supporters obama is only picking up 6 in 10 of those who disapprove of bush this gap is allowing mccain to claim a plurality of all independent voters at this time
5872005 i am delighted that varbusiness continues to recognize women and their contributions in the it industry

5872025 bush daddy has kept pestering me about the issue of living dismemberment probably thinking that this is what it means when psalm 53 5 says that god will scatter the bones of those camping against you bush daddy says this means that the limbs of the designated target will be duct taped and cut off each time the person revives another limb will be cut off and or shortened until he or she succumbs

5872078 a lot of people are into oldies and classic rock cumbia influence all of the traditional latin music we heard growing up
5872079 in the latin music scene i always thought we were a little bit different there are a million bands here in austin and i wouldnt say we are the only ones doing what we do but we accept all kinds of people we are one of the only latin bands in the city that can play latin music festivals and rock clubs
5872080 listening to that music on the radio at my grandmothers house but for myself and same for most of the guys i got into rock and hip hop like most teenagers it wasnt until i was a little bit older that i revisited the music i grew up with cumbias and tejano music
5872081 that music was always there in the background when you went to a restaurant or you went to somebodys wedding or any kind of social event that music was always present
5872082 but it went into the background until we gonzalezs former band the blimp moved up here and then i started to miss it and wanted to incorporate it into what we had been working on down in laredo with grupo we try to focus on making our music sound timeless in a way that represents genres well enough that people from older generations can represent and understand where we are coming from as well as people from younger generations
5872083 thats why everyone can cast a groove and enjoy themselves from the get go
5872084 the audience from the beginning was really diverse it wasnt at all like an exclusively latin music audience back in the day there were clubs here in austin that had a latin scene a salsa scene but we never played those places it took years before we actually played there our audience was just immediately looking for a fun spot to come rock out and dance it took awhile for the latin music scene to start paying attention to what we were doing
5872085 it wasnt like we intentionally set out with rules or some sort of manifesto we just played and naturally what we had already been doing together forever just filtered through
5872086 thats what our early gigs were like a place where all our friends could come and just have a blast friday night everyones had too much drink and we would just dance
5872087 we try to hold onto that same vibe now we want to make everyone feel better than they would have before the show its the least we can do for a cover charge those first few shows were at small clubs and were mostly our friends but we know how to throw a party so the word got out quickly and by the third or fourth show there was already a line around the block
5872088 we did it the old fashioned way we said lets jump in the van and start touring and every time we went back out on the road the crowds doubled sometimes tripled we are starting to see if you dont build something from the ground up then you have no foundation and if they pull the rug out from under you youre screwed

5872556 when stock prices are up managers are less likely to be fired when stock prices are down they are more likely to be fired
5872557 our first results suggested that it does not matter whether a low stock price is driven by firm performance alone or broader market factors
5872558 so its not the case that boards just willy nilly fire ceos when the industry or the economy is doing badly
5872559 this is what i find when talking to members of boards personally
5872560 they report that its really difficult to fire a ceo unless the companys stock valuation is down
5872561 a rising tide may lift all boats but the company may not be benchmarking itself well during such periods
5872562 if a firms stock is up 5 percent while several competitors are up 15 percent then a board may want to think about rocking that boat
5872563 such ceos need to prepare better for the next recession
5872564 best choice in terms of the audience the platforms and the reach
5872565 after careful consideration our board rejected the offer after concluding that their proposal was not in the best interest of our stockholders the board believes the 5 25 offering price does not reflect the value of heelys and that entering into discussions with skechers based on their unsolicited proposal is premature at this time
5872566 from a practical standpoint mmax allows a retail or commercial customer to walk into a community bank and place up to 5 million in a money market account with fdic insurance on the full account balance
5872567 and the funds are only placed in well capitalized banks as designated by the fdic
5872568 pcbb has been very pleased with its experience with the idc deposit program and they are now committed to support this innovation by providing the custodial services to idc deposits customers quality and privacy are of the utmost importance our values are in synch with those of idc deposits
5872569 with all of the uncertainty in the financial markets mmax provides a community banks customers with assurance that all of their deposits will be safe and secure and fully fdic insured
5872570 in addition we recognize the convenience value to bank customers being able to achieve full fdic insurance directly through their own local bank rather than having to open accounts at multiple banks themselves
5872571 our customers money market funds will only be spread among highly capitalized financial institutions
5872572 but in real terms their money market account is accepted and distributed right here at home so the process is seamless to the saver the two major issues are the customers convenience one stop shopping and full fdic insurance protection for their funds
5872573 our participation in mmax will enhance the banking experience of our customers and allow them peace of mind in knowing their funds are safe and secure

5872808 doctors dont always agree on a prognosis there is a fair amount of objectivity and there is a certain amount of subjectivity
5872809 as a result of this recommendation it appears that dr rainville would not sign paperwork to support a total and permanent disability claim
5872810 it appears at this point that dc district chief famolare begins to doctor shop
5872811 following that appointment dr mahoney then signs off on dc famolares paperwork declaring him totally disabled
5872812 even if compliance poses an incidental conflict with the defendants religious beliefs
5872813 as an expression of somebody who calls himself a minister of health its a very unhealthy statement
5872814 i mean where does he come off where does he appoint himself as a moral judge of professionals who he doesnt understand and knows nothing about
5872815 is it unethical for health care professionals to support the administration of drugs that are of unknown substance or purity or potency drugs that cannot otherwise be legally prescribed
5872816 so contrary to what mr clement might think were actually encouraging abstinence
5872817 my question to him is how does it affect you on a personal level that you should be so lacking in compassion for people
5872818 people have realized that when addiction touches their own lives in particular they realize that they really need a tool kit to help an addict and it should include injection sites
5872819 i almost feel a certain amount of pity for the guy clement because i think he doesnt seem to grasp just how sophisticated the level of discussion has been thats gone on around ethics
5872820 to just suddenly enter into the level hes entered this and think that he can sway the canadian medical association people with a few comments i think is very naive of him
5872821 too many canadians have seen the ugly face of drug crime
5872822 theyve had junkies break into their homes to fund a quick fix theyve seen young thugs dealing in schoolyards and getting more kids hooked
5872823 the origin was in germany at the turn of the 20th century
5872824 in america workers comp took root later in the 20th century
5872825 from the start it was designed to cover most non agricultural employment where there is a valid employer employee relationship
5872826 this insulates companies from the massive awards a plaintiff can win in other kinds of court
5872827 from the outset of the workers comp system an exclusive remedy rule has applied which severely limits the right of the employee to sue an employer for negligence
5872828 the injured worker has all of their medical expenses covered without deductions or co pays
5872829 doctor bills hospital bills prescription drug bills all of that is supposed to be covered
5872830 after a waiting period which varies by state and is never over seven days
5872831 workers comp covers all the medicals and indemnity expenses for the lifetime of the claim
5872832 there are rules in each state defining limits to benefits for injuries not deemed permanent in virtually all states the injured worker and their insurer can agree to settle a claim leaving the insurer without any further open obligation in some states many if not most permanent cases are settled
5872833 what are often not covered or covered but with often complicated exclusions are mental claims and disease claims such as cancers from exposure to toxins
5872834 generally these are not covered but court decisions have addressed these issues in virtually all states and these decisions rather than the language of the law tend to govern
5872835 the most common ground for rejecting claims which can only be done by the insurer is that the injury was not caused by work
5872836 a proficient adjuster should be able to make that determination perhaps with the help of a doctor who inspects the worker
5872837 in many states the adjuster can delay making such a decision for months
5872838 and if the adjuster decides then to deny the claim the already paid benefits to the worker are not returned
5872839 under workers comp law a person is not entitled to get benefits unless they are an employee
5872840 im not arguing about medical issues im not arguing about doctors im arguing that this person is not an employee
5872841 and the rules set largely by court decisions vary by states
5872842 typically an independent contractor is being paid to complete a job to complete a task and is not being paid by the hour
5872843 if i hire a painter to paint my house im not supervising that persons every brush stroke
5872844 injuries by undocumented workers are usually covered by workers compensation
5872845 the concierge desk the porters the superintendents the maintenance people are all typically employees of the building

5872848 those who want to prevail in hyper competitive markets need this book
5872849 readily available marketing tips and tutorials accessible on the internet and other public forums tend to be outdated or incorrect while the techniques that really deliver results are kept close to the chest of those in the dominating minority

5872864 every mans work whether it be literature or music or picture or architecture or anything else is a portrait of himself and the more he tries to conceal himself the more clearly will his character appear in spite of him

5872891 full of lively characters and wacky coincidence this page turning series aims to become the tales of the city of the new millennium in the popular imagination the heyday of gay life is long gone washed away by aids but in this love song to san francisco mark abramson gives the lie to that myth revealing the joy that still inheres to life in the city by the bay the quirky charm of san francisco is alive and well and living in the pages of beach reading

5872900 does it mean weve mis gaged the situation in afghanistan i dont think so my take is the taliban have not went away its not so much a resurgence as response that we recognize were presenting more force there as we present a greater sustained force there the taliban come out to fight
5872901 theyre fighting in more organized ttp tactics techniques and procedures than we would have seen six years ago when we fouht bands of irregular fighters weve seen ttp changes so theyre fighting more in company sized elements im not saying necessarily that theyre more effective a lot of their ttp remains the same its not to say theyre growing stronger

5872943 potomac horse fever crops up as mini epidemics when conditions are right
5872944 we dont usually see it in missouri and weve seen a lot of it this year on both the illinois and missouri sides of the mississippi river
5872945 examination of clinic records identified three horses which had died or were euthanized in the weeks preceding the first confirmed case and fitted the clinical case definition of sudden onset fever rapid deterioration over 24 48hrs and neurological and or respiratory system involvement
5872946 efforts were made to ascertain the hendra virus infection status of these horses
5872947 samples available from an external diagnostic laboratory were limited to blood smears for each horse other samples had been discarded all were negative by pcr assay but this result is not regarded as conclusive by the testing laboratory because of the sub optimal sample
5872948 investigations on the property of origin of all three horses found no evidence of infection in any in contact horse on the basis of these investigations the three horses are regarded as improbable cases
5872949 in the fortnight prior to its illness the horse was housed in yards overhung by trees
5872950 flying foxes the recognised natural host of hendra virus are regularly observed in trees in the area
5872951 it is hypothesised that the horse was exposed to infectious body fluids from a flying fox plausibly via contamination of feed water or yard rails and became infected
5872952 the timeline suggests that horse 1 was likely the source of infection for horses 2 4
5872953 unless we see a rapid and improved turnaround in weather conditions in the next week growers are looking at severe yield losses

5872956 mark warner is going to make the keynote address at the democratic convention and thats a lot of virginia exposure and when that was announced it seemed to me that it probably means that kaines stock is slipping
5872957 i came out to go to the mailbox and there was half a dozen police cars in the neighborhood so i thought this could be serious
5872958 this is one of the really serious intense short termed drought periods that weve faced
5872959 this pasture i mean its past the point of even calling it a pasture were sustaining these animals on just dry fiber right now
5872960 selling them because we are out of feed out of grass out of money
5872961 its always a possibility and without the declaration it is often not available
5872962 it involves the producers having additional expenses and in taking years to recoup that
5872963 were doing the best we can were trying to provide a healthy food source for a discerning public and the public needs to know that its tough out here where we are
5872964 members of the lynchburg police department are working closely with a number of law enforcement agencies in the area to make sure we provide a safe and orderly event
5872965 you have technical things like microphones getting ready for the press like you guys and making sure things are safe and secure
5872966 by the time things get going in the gym area with the senator we will have moved for the most part towards the auditorium
5872967 how many kids are going to be able to say my high school had a presidential candidate visit
5872968 there are people who have taken two hours one way to get here to get a ticket
5872969 regardless of who you ever plan on voting for its a neat opportunity to be involved with the american political system
5872970 when that happens the level of perceived danger goes up
5872971 regardless of whats in his mind the officer thats perceiving all of this sees this as dangerous so the evaluation is how do i stop that stop the attack and the answer in this case is lethal force
5872972 see the kids in the back thats another danger area
5872973 the individual was trying to flee struck two police officers there are civilians on bikes kids on bikes it appeared to be in the immediate area hes heading in that direction the cop has that split second decision to make the decision to fire and i think it was perfectly appropriate
5872974 right now all i have is an opportunity to play well said janzen who won the 1994 barclays when it was a regular field event
5872975 if i play well and miss the cut i havent gained anything because 145 and 144 are basically the same
5872976 i have the opportunity to move up a good week hopefully at the end of this week we can look back and say this was a great opportunity
5872977 if there was a turning point it was when i realized i was focusing on all the things i was doing wrong and i wanted to focus on all the things i wanted to do he said
5872978 my whole life up until the last few years anything going on in my life if i put effort into it i could turn it around and it wasnt happening i kept thinking i would but i wouldnt
5872979 im not there yet but im going to get there
5872980 theres an inspiration right there janzen said smiling and saying hello
5872981 hes what three in the world four in the world
5872982 his goal was to get better thats the first thing some guys dont want to get better theyre happier complaining they walk around with a dark cloud over them
5872983 the first day we worked if he told me we would have got my swing to where it is now i would not have believed him janzen said
5872984 in fact it was a challenge the first day to get my hands moving in my swing where i needed to go
5872985 but i knew i had to do something i could not play the way i was playing its been a long thing a long process sometimes i wonder if it would have been better if i just took a year off and worked on my swing trying to work on your swing and trying to play golf at the same time not easy
5872986 i marvel at guys that make swing changes and continue to play great tiger and phil both have done that and vijay too but its very difficult to change your swing and play week to week and get any momentum going
5872987 its very strange the first because i always wanted to be thinking about my swing and about the shot and i figured why i wasnt successful was because i wasnt thinking hard enough about it he said
5872988 and they wanted me not to think about it at all
5872989 once you get the feeling of that more quiet mind its easier to go there he said
5872990 you look at tiger and he looks totally free when he hits it
5872991 they know they did something wrong and they were still ignorant
5872992 at first i just wanted an apology now because they want ed to be ignorant and rude i have to take it to the next level
5872993 as the officers were in the lower apartment one of the detectives reviewed the search warrant application and realized it was for the upper apartment
5872994 it appears to be an honest mistake and we certainly apologize to all involved
5872995 i have realized i have much more in common with a christian from palestine than with a muslim from the west the differences are mainly cultural not religious
5872996 development which meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs
5872997 but we would not be getting too far ahead of the rest of the world
5872998 in fact we would still have the toughest scheme in the world because even the european union only proposes to auction 20 per cent of its permits in the ninth year of its schemes operation
5872999 auctioning only 20 per cent of permits would repeat the big mistake made by the european union when they started which was to give away permits allowing the big polluters to take windfall gains by passing on the carbon price for which they were already being fully compensated
5873000 that system is just going to create an enormous lobbying fight to get into the boat for the free permits
5873001 its going to be enormously difficult for the government to maintain the integrity of their scheme
5873002 we also think they are proposing to use an extremely crude filter with that formula to determine which companies get compensation because they are making a judgment based on revenue rather than based on a companys margins so they are not looking at a companys capacity to pay and they are making that judgment based on a few years prices which happen to be at the absolute top of the commodity cycle
5873003 there is a growing recognition in the government that they need to make haste slowly
5873004 inconsistencies and distortions not seen in public policy since the debate about gst on food
5873005 in the eu they gave windfall profits to the polluters who passed on higher prices anyway

5873013 the weekend before cassandra was killed there was an article about a lady having 13 duis and cassandra said mom how does this happen and i had no answer for that
5873014 hopefully people will see these signs and ask why were these people on the road
5873015 since we established the program there have been a number of local agencies in our state who have developed companion programs they use very similar signs and program criteria
5873016 its a really tough position for us as well when we go to these scenes and we see what it does to the families
5873017 we have more people killed in automobile accidents that way then we do by guns so its a very serious thing
5873018 set out each day believing in your dreams know without a doubt that you were made for amazing things

5873020 by the end of the session commodities have given up about half their gains whereas the euro and aussie are still trading close to their highs
5873021 were still bullish on the us dollar but having gone up so rapidly and so much in advance of what interest rate differentials are doing there comes a point where market dynamics suggest that there could be some vulnerability
5873022 the story that we have is ongoing pressure on global economies ongoing pressure on commodities and ongoing pressure on commodity currencies
5873023 it doesnt add up to a very positive aussie dollar picture
5873024 just keep working baseball is definitely a strange game but its a business at times moves have to be made
5873025 but you never know for what reason you get put somewhere else im looking at nothing but positives being here and hopefully being a part of things here next year as well

5873037 ik was op zoek naar de gepaste persoon om mijn nummers de juiste inkleuring te geven ik hield onmiddellijk van wat hij deed vooral de kurt weill accenten in zijn werk trokken me enorm aan
5873038 het is zeker niet zo dat ik de nummers van tanja volledig herwerkt heb
5873039 aanvankelijk zorgde ik gewoon voor wat extra invullingen maar geleidelijk aan gingen we ook samen componeren dat we allebei een zwak hadden voor muzikaal theater en kurt weill zorgde al heel snel voor de juiste vibes
5873040 zelf had ik die link nog niet gelegd maar je hebt gelijk bij ons is er ook die mengeling van vrolijkheid en melancholie
5873041 wat de hoes betreft wilden we alleszins zeker iets dat visueel opviel wanneer ik een nummer schrijf denk ik daar ook onmiddellijk beelden bij we zijn echter geen hippieband natuurlijk kennen we de platen van devendra maar hij klinkt toch wel heel amerikaans terwijl wij meer onze eigen europese accenten naar voor brengen
5873042 twee uur geleden waren we nog in barcelona en nu geven we hier in brussel een interview
5873043 dat nummer heb ik geschreven toen we van het hectische barcelona op het vredige mallorca terechtkwamen op zo een rustige plek leer je plots heel wat relativeren je beseft dan dat vele zaken dikwijls op de verkeerde manier uitvergroot worden
5873044 contradictie is waar het allemaal om draait het leven is een grote tegenstelling maar ondanks dat blijven marc en ik echte controlefreaks zij het elk op een ander niveau
5873045 dat klopt in de letterlijke betekenis van het woord daar tegenover staat dat ik me wel thuis voel op verschillende plaatsen het is vooral een gevoelservaring mensen hebben de neiging om in hun veilige en vertrouwde omgeving te blijven maar wie de stap zet om verder te kijken ontdekt dat daar buiten ook plekken zijn waar je terechtkunt en waar je dezelfde waarden ontdekt
5873046 the governor will play some kind of unspecified role in the convention
5873047 but the only contact with the mccain campaign has been a request for her to participate in a national conference call on energy issues there has been no outreach or vetting regarding the vice presidency
5873048 her rise is a great and rare story of how adherence to principle especially to transparency and accountability in government can produce political success
5873049 it has been up for a while and used to be a fully functional webpage with newsfeeds bios etc however the stay tuned message is new
5873050 we have handed the case to the police and also submitted our findings to our disciplinary board
5873051 we have done a thorough investigation and were confident the restaurant is not the source
5873052 while we continue to seek large non recurrent sales like the sale to the u s army we believe that the continued growth in our core business is critical to our success we are pleased that our core business has continued to grow even in a difficult environment we continue to believe that our efforts in introducing new products will begin to bear fruit in the fourth quarter of this year
5873053 whether you like gravity or agree with gravity is not relevant gravity is much in the same way you can either like or dislike globalization it really does not matter globalization just is its a reality
5873054 as a leader in dram technology hynix is pleased to be working with metaram and intel to successfully develop the worlds first 16gb ddr3 module
5873055 with this product introduction we expect to see growth in high performance high density applications
5873056 hynix has always been at the leading edge of memory innovation and it immediately understood how our new ddr3 metaram technology could improve customers overall compute performance by increasing the memory capacity and frequency
5873057 weve seen good market traction with our ddr2 metaram chipset we believe that the adoption into intel based servers and workstations as well as the memory bandwidth benefits of ddr3 metaram will garner even more momentum for our chipsets and technology
5873058 we support the desire to make nevada the focal point of renewable energy development with the hope of making our state energy independent and reducing carbon and other emissions
5873059 whether its through efficiency renewables more stringent building codes or the deployment of plug in hybrid electric vehicles we are fortunate that in nevada we have the capability of leading the nation in these important issues
5873060 we already have much to be proud of here in nevada having used geothermal power for more than 20 years with more to come and that the nevada solar one and nellis photovoltaic projects came on line last year
5873061 in addition our company has committed 135 million toward the clinton global initiative as well as increased its investment in energy efficiency and customer owned renewable energy from 2 million in 2001 to a planned 60 to 80 million in 2008
5873062 our ongoing efforts to complete more renewable projects transmit that energy statewide as well as provide programs to our customers that reduce overall demand build the much needed momentum toward the goal of energy independence in nevada for nevadans
5873063 we are excited to bring on a talented executive to assume this position on an interim basis until we announce a permanent chief financial officer
5873064 clintons 35 years of finance experience will be helpful during this transition period following completion of our restatement we are in the final stages of our permanent cfo search and hope to make that announcement shortly
5873065 set out each day believing in your dreams know without a doubt that you were made for amazing things
5873066 if they dont have the bus to get to work then they are going to be back down here at the department of social services trying to get some help there so to me youre going to pay it out of one hand or the other

5873072 las vegas is a must for anyone venturing to north america even if its just for a look some great meals and shopping
5873073 id like to swing by las vegas this afternoon to look at the fake new york too maybe get a bite to eat gas up the tank
5873074 i got on and sat my beautiful glutes in a row of two unused seats facing forward taking the window seat its a good thing too because a perfectly poundable asian pussy rested its lips on the seat next to me
5873075 the big presidential debates coming up are we still excited about that barack obama wants to debate about foreign policy and john mccain wants to debate about the big band era
5873076 actually analysts say a weak economy is causing less energy use resulting in falling oil prices yeah basically the worse the economy the lower the oil prices which means if bush could serve one more term oil would be free
5873077 well barack obama and john mccain have both switched their positions on offshore oil drilling they both used to be against it but now they say they are for it under the right circumstances like if it helps them get elected
5873078 well john mccains daughter is now writing a childrens book based on her fathers life see the research has been difficult because as you know much of mccains early life story is only available through folklore so theres not much written down
5873079 strengths he leads overall and hes strong with women even stronger among young folks and astronomically strong with blacks weaknesses sen john mccain beats him among white voters men older folks and white catholics
5873080 i grew up with my dad im an only child my father was a cowboy and he really loved me very much but i think he wanted a son occasionally
5873081 im upset im angry it makes me feel like a non person kind of
5873082 i saw him at christmas and birthdays and he provided money for school clothes and he called occasionally
5873083 cindy has to put such a fine point on it by saying something thats not true
5873084 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
5873085 as president ill make our space program a priority again by devoting the attention and resources needed to not only inspire the world with feats of exploration but also improve life here on earth
5873086 we need to continue to work to create a real push towards reversing the obesity epidemic it is time we make it a national priority
5873087 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5873088 continues to invest millions of dollars in television field operations and commit his personal time
5873089 its summer and voters arent paying a lot of attention to this race when they do the incumbents lead may get bigger if voters dont get too concerned about the senators age
5873090 legally its a stretch to think that they would be covered in the waiver and the evidence is the fact that they are conducting an environmental assessment under the nepa
5873091 why would they be complying with nepa if they didnt have to
5873092 why would they not just turn around and say this is waived

5873097 novatek discovered in just five months that its business was being negatively impacted by the lack of required functionalities in the sap product set
5873098 additionally the company felt it would be cost prohibitive to install the additional sap functionality required in such areas as manufacturing sales and accounting these functionalities are available out of the box with syspro
5873099 syspro sets the benchmark high for the technology solutions that we deliver to the small and mid market
5873100 the tier one market leaders are struggling to understand the vast difference in requirements for smaller businesses conversely we know what the market needs and have built these desired functionalities into the syspro product we will continue to help manufacturing and distribution companies to realize their full potential by giving them an extra advantage that they cant get from other software providers even those serving the largest companies

5873104 we hypothesized that people with high bas measurements were probably more prone to pleasure seeking which has been found to correlate with activation in the dopamine systems of the brain
5873105 retailers who spray perfumes or have enticing food smells in their store seem to know instinctively the value of scent in triggering peoples pleasure seeking

5873119 the 10 day process yielded a lot more information than we had at the start and that was a key objective all along
5873120 the students had repeatedly said the lawsuit was an impediment to opening up a productive dialogue with the mbta about their findings now that the court proceedings are behind us i renew my invitation to the students to sit down with us and discuss their findings a great opportunity now presents itself
5873121 with respect to the information that was sealed i have every expectation that the students will act in accordance with the principles of responsible disclosure
5873122 students have the ability to cause significant harm to the charlieticket system during the roughly five month window that remedial actions will require
5873123 invaluable but there are additional materials that cause us great concern
5873124 it wasnt to enable others to get a free fare or cause any sort of havoc
5873125 it was really to show how major the issues are in this system which also might resonate in many other systems around the world
5873126 the 10 day process yielded a lot more information than we had at the start and that was a key objective all along
5873127 the students had repeatedly said the lawsuit was an impediment to opening up a productive dialogue with the mbta about their findings now that the court proceedings are behind us i renew my invitation to the students to sit down with us and discuss their findings a great opportunity now presents itself
5873128 now that the authority has unsuccessfully attempted to cover up their stupidity in selecting this 75 million automated fare collection system and after the authority rejected the students fair offer and instead attempted to criminalize them now the authority would like to have a helpful little site down chit chat

5873132 its an awful thing solitary it crushes your spirit and weakens your resistance more effectively than any other form of mistreatment there is little doubt that solitary confinement causes some mental deterioration in even the most resilient of personalities through flashed hand signals when we were moved about tap codes on the wall notes hidden in washroom drains and holding out enamel drinking cups up to the wall with our shirts wrapped around them and speaking through them we were able to communicate with one another
5873133 mccain cant even fly an airplane let alone lead this country

5873143 with all due respect to cardiff city theres only so many options in a place of that size for stories compared to a huge city like london
5873144 but how many people are willing to make a commitment to watch something over five consecutive nights these days whats the dramatic point that cant be served by weekly episodes or are they relying on everyone recording it or iplayering it

5873165 could you squeeze and crush one with your bare hands would you be prepared to insert one inside your body how about biting into a frog while its still alive
5873166 im going to tell you something you probably didnt know about frogs
5873167 when they cry they sound like cats its absolutely true as soon as ms haruhi arrived on set she heard the frogs crying do you have a cat in here she asked yes i said several i didnt want to startle her
5873168 although the costumes i had designed for my actors were inspired by the cirque du soleil
5873169 the idea for the film itself came from alice in wonderland in my version of the story alice gets lost in a supernatural world and instead of a toadstool consumes a feast of frog flesh fed to her by two mysterious guards who look a bit like tweedledum and tweedledee
5873170 as you can imagine every inch of the studio was covered in amphibian blood and guts
5873171 quite a few of the frogs were still alive but in order to dispose of the bodies they needed to be dead i split the crew up into pairs and we systematically exterminated them it was like a production line one person held the limbs of a frog the other smashed it between the eyes with a hammer there was no joy in it
5873172 i cant even look at them let alone touch them but i hired an all female crew for this shoot and as they were engaged in killing the frogs they shrieked in horror just the look on their faces told me they were clearly not enjoying themselves but of course i was having a ball

5873242 the love family ideology has no theory of permanence or binding obligation it is oriented to adults interests and satisfactions because it emphasizes freedom of individual choice you can pick the one you love and ditch the one you no longer love without a backward glance thats great for adults but children dont have the same freedom of choice or the same enthusiasm about moving on from a childs standpoint the love family ideology is inadequate because it offers no basis for permanence in family bonds and commitments when these bonds are lost children suffer emotionally especially in their ability to trust weve set up a failure to commit factor for the next generation

5873273 our roaming prices will come down as a result of this deal
5873274 there is potential within the joint venture with telstra on your own or any other alternatives
5873275 we have always said that we would consider commercial proposals for wholesale access to our 3g 850 next g network and we have done just that

5873297 while many of the winners were teachers who committed reprehensible acts and yet were not fired the majority of the nominations we received were for teachers who simply didnt seem to care about teaching
5873298 the fact is our education system isnt imperiled as much by the rogue teacher who has a sexual relationship with a student that person should simply be in jail as it is by the entrenched mediocrity that is bred by bad union policies such as teacher tenure and the absence of merit pay
5873299 we held this contest to jump start a conversation about the negative impact teachers unions are having on our public education system and to advocate on behalf of good teachers by promoting merit pay and opposing teacher tenure we hope to continue to promote these ideas any way we can

5873364 i had a little bit of experience when i went to new trier township high school in the chicago suburb of winnetka ill there was a short lived band i was in called collective moss
5873365 we only played two gigs we were the worlds worst cover band we were just awful
5873366 but i could read music and thats how i learned the tracks for the rocker i would tape the score on the drum set and learn to play that way this made it easier for me to pick up the rhythm
5873367 jason sudeikus would say some of the most wildly inappropriate stuff that would come out in a stream of consciousness josh gad had the strangest wiring of his brain you never knew what he was going to do

5873374 but there has to be enough similarities so the office fans will line up when the rocker opens to see the guy who plays dwight play a heavy metal rocker dude it was just a blast to enter into that whole genre of music
5873375 ive been very fortunate because dwight schrute comes from the writers and creator greg daniels they arent interested in doing things the normal way things have been done
5873376 they want to find different facets and different sides to all the characters
5873377 when you see dwights vulnerabilities people respond to it and are more likely to tune in then we get to make more episodes

5873381 eighteen year olds really arent that in control of themselves especially whenever theyre intoxicated

5873434 19 08 08 ich the north atlantic treaty organization nato is a relic of the cold war it was created on april 4 1949 as a defensive alliance of western europe countries plus canada and the united states to protect the former countries from encroachments by the soviet union but since 1991 the soviet empire no longer exists and russia has been cooperating economically with western european countries supplying them with gas and oil and all types of commodities this has increased european economic interdependence and thus greatly reduced the need for such a defensive military alliance above and beyond european countries own self defense military system but the u s government does not see things that way it would prefer keeping its role as europes patronizing protector and as the worlds sole superpower nato is a convenient tool to that effect but maybe the world should be worried about those who go around the planet with a can of gasoline in one hand and a box of matches in the other pretending to sell fire insurance

5873439 is from its title onward a confined and limited interpretation of the available information its limited to a debate about foreknowledge of 9 11 therefore israeli participation in the attacks is strictly off limits
5873440 perhaps most intriguing the israelis military and intelligence specialties are listed
5873441 on october 10 2001 two israelis one a former israeli army colonel and the other a mossad agent were arrested in the mexican congress with 9mm pistols and dynamite according to the mexican justice department official web site the head of congressional security salvador alarcn verified that the israelis had in their possession nine hand grenades sticks of dynamite detonators wiring and two 9mm glock automatics the israelis were subsequently released after the intervention of the israeli embassy in mexico city
5873442 when the fbi developed the photos taken by the israelis of the world trade center carnage one photo depicted kurzburg mossad agent flicking a cigarette lighter in a celebratory manner with the burning buildings in the background
5873443 fbi upon searching the warehouse discovered fertilizer other chemicals for making explosives pipes caps and traces of anthrax
5873444 after anthrax was discovered investigators wearing hazardous material suits went through the warehouse residents around urban moving systems who had connections to the local police also reported that helicopters with infrared radar swooped in over the warehouse on several occasions
5873445 the telegraph quoted a senior israeli security official as saying the mossad experts had no specific information about what was being planned
5873446 they had no specific information about what was being planned but linked the plot to osama bin laden and told the americans that there were strong grounds for suspecting iraqi involvement said a senior israeli security official
5873447 after serving two and a half months in prison and after a barrage of official complaints from the israeli government the five israeli movers kurzberg his brother paul kurzberg yaron shmuel oded elner and omer marmari were released over the objections of the cia and permitted to return home
5873448 the bumbling aspect of the art student thing was intentional
5873449 cia cables contemporaneously discussed mihdhar s travel and the fact that he had a us visa in his saudi passport

5873454 i dont have to dance around questions my family keeps asking me
5873455 a couple of family thought it was going to be a wedding
5873456 so after a while everybody got over the initial shock and i think we all had a good time
5873457 theres a plethora of symbols in our lives that mean nothing
5873458 i dont require a ceremony but i will acquiesce if thats what arlene wants

5873460 at a recent potluck dinner my friend brian brought a six pack of his special cider we had more beverages than we needed at the end of the evening brian went into the refrigerator and grabbed his untouched cider he took it home
5873461 our hostess nancy was furious she wrote brian a strong email claiming he had insulted her
5873462 why would i be asked to edit this report when im a senior manager
5873463 why would anyone skip a meeting when we specifically said attendance was expected
5873464 writing copy starting with a written discussion of our target market
5873465 i though expected meant lightly suggested so i skipped the meeting and took a client to lunch
5873466 he thinks he is a lost confused newcomer let s explain that we need to go have coffee and it s a non negotiable right now
5873467 unitedfuture will introduce shared parenting as a default position for child custody arrangements in the family court
5873468 shared parenting is currently granted in only one in nine judgements by the family court with sole custody given to only one parent in eight out of ten cases which is an extremely unsatisfactory situation
5873469 shared parenting would mean that when both parents want custody there will be a presumption that day to day care will be shared unless there are good reasons why it should not be
5873470 children deserve full functioning natural loving dedicated relationships with both of their parents equally in and out of marriage whenever possible
5873471 our investigation is continuing so i cant give you those names
5873472 i can tell you that three of the containers were headed for los angeles county and three for orange county but thats all the information we are releasing at this time

5873476 they intend and probably still do intend to strangle georgia and its economy
5873477 we need to start drilling offshore on advanced oil rigs like this one
5873478 new drilling has got to be part of our energy solution
5873479 in the current economic condition people are driving less and it obviously affects every facet of the u s auto industry including how often they replace tires or buy new cars
5873480 the current economic condition further impacted the stores but they were not performing well before this year and we dont expect them to perform well
5873481 we can do no great things only small things with great love
5873482 it was ball to hand inside the box so im giving a penalty
5873483 the paintings look at time harold wellman spent on the west coast prospecting for gold during the depression and trips he made in the early 1940s with his fellow government geologist dick willett following the alpine fault in south westland
5873484 i was captivated by this frontier intellectual who initially had no formal academic training and so started with few preconceived ideas basing his thinking on what he observed in the field
5873485 i knocked on their door explained my project and asked where their furniture had gone
5873486 before i knew it we were taking the chairs back to the garden from their garage so that i could take the photo
5873487 my interest in this subject has already rubbed off on my two young children who often point out interesting places that mum should photograph as they pass various houses in the car
5873488 i guess this is the kind of thing that happens anywhere that people would rather sit on a couch than on a street bench
5873489 about a year ago we started to make environmental changes in the way we operate a lot of our clients are government and corporate clients and were very loyal to them
5873490 its been a growing concern on our minds for a while but we werent quite sure what we could do about it being that were a transport fleet weve been visiting companies that have gone carbon neutral and getting their advice
5873491 were measuring our emissions at the moment and then plan to reduce and offset them were trying to make our office as paperless as we can through recycling and reducing our electricity use
5873492 our big issue is we cant send a big six cylinder car to someones house and say its environmentally friendly the new vehicle rule is a huge step in that direction and weve investigated these cars thoroughly
5873493 weve also trialled the toyota estima hybrid which we have had for the past year now and this hybrid vehicle can hold up to 6 passengers our customers have been really stoked with the fact that were taking it seriously
5873494 we talk to them about our sustainability initiatives so they can see what were doing the drivers of the hybrids love them and so do our customers
5873495 the company has demonstrated its commitment to the environment and signalled its long term sustainability policy direction to all taxi users
5873496 we are supporting our taxicharge partners throughout new zealand in their quest for sustainability converting fleets to hybrid fuel efficient low emission vehicles is one way of achieving this
5873497 the vouchers get them from the city to home and there are seven different zones if your children are out and about and they need to get home but have no money they can use their voucher they cant exchange them for cash
5873498 were about to rebrand and market them we worked with the police and the wellington city council on the vouchers and the feedback weve received has been really positive
5873499 our drivers operate to a high standard and we receive a lot of complements and loyalty
5873500 if rivers and streams are muddy for a prolonged period whitebait will not return and fish populations will decline
5873501 floods and slips can cause natural turbidity during storms but construction activities such as subdivisions and forestry can cause turbid conditions to persist for much longer periods
5873502 its difficult to manage the effects of flooding on water turbidity in rivers and streams but developers should seriously consider doing major earthworks outside the whitebait season
5873503 greater awareness around the impact of earthworks on nearby streams will help the regions whitebait numbers to restock and improve
5873504 these areas contain important ecological values and vital habitat for coastal and estuarine wildlife
5873505 we didnt shift the ball quick enough and i thought we were too cautious we took that extra touch that you cant afford against a team like queensland and they got on top of us
5873506 we got better in the second half without reaching any high levels and got ourselves back in the game were probably going away happy with a point
5873507 i think in game one everyones being a little bit tentative because youre getting the season under way and you dont want to make mistakes my message at halftime was to release the shackles and be a bit more positive and to start playing the way we know were capable of
5873508 we came out a bit flat in the second half and after we conceded that goal we lifted a bit and equalised not long after so its a positive sign that we hit back and showed character after some lapses in concentration
5873509 i think everyone was trying to find their feet in front of the home crowd and it was a bit scrappy
5873510 its a matter of taking things forward now its probably a relief for everyone to get the first 90 minutes of the season out of the way and theres some good points to build on and some areas right across the park where we need to be a hell of a lot better
5873511 smart people spend all their formative years getting rewarded for finding problems for focusing on the negative they leave school thinking that the way to be useful and show your smarts is to point out why things wont work
5873512 it was a gutsy performance that im sure had everyone watching the race on the edge of their seats as nick held out the frenchman to take third place and the bronze medal i certainly was
5873513 nick is 100 hutt valley and proud of it and we couldnt be more proud of him and what he has achieved
5873514 his mighty performance is something that should inspire all of us he has shown that with hard work determination and sacrifice anything can be achieved
5873515 i want to acknowledge nicks wife and family for their support throughout his career this must be a very special moment for them
5873516 in the next few days i will be discussing with my council colleagues an appropriate way to recognise nicks success
5873517 we really need paper products like tissues and toilet paper and baby food

5873576 a lot of the procedural issues necessary for instant replay to be implemented need to be worked out
5873577 major league baseball needs to step up to the plate and iron out these issues
5873578 im not going to go through these one by one i will tell you that on a number of them the comments are simply not accurate
5873579 for example weve had an understanding with the wua for some time that the crew chief and the crew chief only would be the one responsible for reviewing the video and making the decision on instant replay
5873580 there are other issues that remain to be worked out it is my general policy that i dont comment when im trying to bargain but i remain confident that were gong to be able to make a deal
5873581 thus there will be a lack of transparency and obviousness for the public as to what is going on when instant replay is under way
5873582 there may be situations where the umpires will have to leave the field in shifts so that everyone can view the video while leaving the requisite number of umpires on the field
5873583 this could create a laurel and hardy effect and may cause delay of game problems

5873587 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
5873588 to give you an example more than 20 years ago i was the only one in the world to predict the discovery of billions of quasars in the infrared spectrum as well as an accelerating expansion of the universe
5873589 the dutch satellite iras was launched on january 26th 1983
5873590 according to geryl iras should be able to prove that his calculations are correct and that the satellite should trace billions of supergalaxies that radiate extremely high energies and are besides very rapidly moving away from us almost at the speed of light
5873591 this implies that these kinds of systems cannot be seen from earth with normal light telescopes but with the help of an infrared telescope like the one the dutch space probe has aboard should iras discover such systems this would mean that the relativity theory of einstein is not correct and would give us a complete new space time dimension so says geryl
5873592 according to the relativity theory the quickest galaxies of the cosmos the quasar systems should age more slowly moreover one should not detect any rapid changes in their structure and gravitational force besides the quasar worlds should radiate less energy because of their time dilatation however according to the man from deurne one doesnt actually see this time dilatation but something completely different something that subverts the complete theory of einstein
5873593 the quasars are collapsing they perish even faster than other galaxies in fact the superexplosions are taking place at a very high speed so this means that the quasars are not at all sensitive to this time dilatation on the contrary they are far more unstable and they are destroying themselves with a catastrophical gravitational collapse they even accelerate their self destruction through the coagulating mass because mass increases with speed and they finally die in the most violent explosions of the universe
5873594 in his easy reading book geryl explains these phenomena concluding that the world famous relativity theory is not correct his deductions are astonishing and create a completely new space time dimension whose implications will be enormous and if geryl is right of extreme importance to science the future will show who is right
5873595 on friday november 23rd 1990 again i explained everything to the popular scientific
5873596 in the early nineties billions of quasars were discovered in the infrared spectrum
5873597 in 1998 it became known that the universe is expanding with an acceleration

5873830 n o tenho que temer nada e nem prever nada porque como ministro da justi a estou vinculado decis o do supremo estou dedicado nesse momento juntamente com a pol cia federal em verificar qual a melhor maneira de operacionalizar a s mula em seguran a para o agente e para o custodiado
5873831 um trabalho de intelig ncia s lido e de uma fundamenta o t cnica muito pesada
5873832 quando o agente se aproximar do custodiado ele vai ter que exigir um determinado comportamento e se ele n o observar esse determinado comportamento a est justificado o uso de algemas sendo ordem judicial n o se pode excluir tamb m a possibilidade de que ela j venha com uma determina o do juiz segundo a periculosidade daquela pessoa tem um terreno bastante amplo a ser conversado e tratado de maneira correta e adequada honrando a decis o do supremo

5873837 lo que llamamos en otros pecado consideramos en nosotros como experiencia
5873838 y tras un riguroso serio y profundo estudio de investigaci n hemos conseguido dar con la verdadera causa por la que este mundo se est convirtiendo en una lujuriosa manceb a
5873839 yo pienso que es una relaci n vergonzosa entre el gobierno actual de colombia con las pol ticas estadunidenses
5873840 primero no disminuye el cultivo ni el consumo entonces lo que queda claro es la actitud tramposa y mentirosa de las dos partes porque fundamentalmente lo que est n combatiendo es a la guerrilla que es un problema pol tico militar en el pa s
5873841 hay un gran desconocimiento de lo que ocurre al interior de colombia de la manera como fue elegido este gobierno por grupos paramilitares que se benefician fundamentalmente del narcotr fico
5873842 no difiera mucho de los dictadores de am rica latina como el caso de fujimori
5873843 encasillar a las farc como terroristas no ayuda absolutamente nada entre otras cosas porque a muchos no les interesa eso y a las farc les interesa menos eso es un mon logo de sordos
5873844 creo que habr una derrota al pensamiento militarista guerrerista que admira las relaciones entre los pa ses en una condici n de subordinaci n y no de pares e iguales
5873845 la sola falta de legitimidad y credibilidad del gobierno con m s de la mitad de los congresistas que lo eligieron a uribe en la c rcel m s demostraciones de que la elecci n fue una estrategia paramilitar la campa a de descr dito de la suprema corte de justicia todo eso abunda en razones para no creerles y son razones para creer que es un gobierno ileg timo no cre ble sucio corrupto
5873846 pero s se ha incrementado la guerra al interior del pa s
5873847 una decisi n responsable de los pol ticos mexicanos es acudir a los informes de la onu para darse cuenta que es la peor decisi n que se pueda tomar
5873848 un gran negocio para los que se benefician de la guerra los grandes contratos las grandes comisiones los ej rcitos la guerra es un negocio y favorece a sus operadores
5873849 s asesinaron a muchos de los jefes de la droga famosos como pablo escobar y a otros los extraditaron como los rodr guez orejuela pero despu s de eso se puede decir que se democratiz el negocio de la droga y han surgido por lo menos 80 c rteles o m s colombia no es m s pac fica lo que ha sucedido en el pa s es tan desastroso que personas como yo estar amos dispuestas a ir al congreso mexicano a contarles realmente los resultados de esta guerra
5873850 no es que se olvida las violaciones y las agresiones de colombia ni de estados unidos por supuesto ni del presidente uribe sino que es un gesto de que sabemos lo que ustedes han hecho pero vamos a dar un paso no de olvidar sino de decir vamos a seguir adelante a ver como podemos relacionarnos hay que aceptar un hecho y es que todos son pa ses vecinos ma ana no se va uribe entonces venezuela tiene que convivir con colombia y busca la f rmula para hacerlo
5873851 rafael correa hizo su exposici n y hasta el final a pesar de darle la mano a uribe estuvo firme
5873852 esa fue una manera de salir de este impasse est bamos trancados en algo que era muy feo muy negativo nadie le gustaba y era malo para todos salimos de esto pero mas adelante habr n otros momentos de tensi n entre los pa ses imposible cuando hay modelos con tanto conflicto que chocan
5873853 quando meno te lo aspetti c qualcosa che non va un momento stai ridendo ma qlcosa cambier
5873854 queremostener una ronda con los l deres de todos los partidos pol ticos para manifestarles que queremos que se le d un mayor presupuesto a la 17 514 ley contra la violencia dom stica con el que hay no se puede trabajar bien en los juzgados ni en las comisar as de las mujeres lasherramientas existen est n pero si no hay un mayor capital no vamos a avanzar
5873855 nosvendamos los ojos porque estamos indefensas e invisibles y porque la justicia en este pa s es ciega lenta ineficaz perono desconocemos lo que hace el estado a trav s del instituto nacional de las mujeres inamu y la secretar a de la mujer de la imm ni hablar de las organizaciones sociales pero queremos que exista un mayor presupuesto
5873856 se encuentra fundamentado en un patr n de conducta que sit a a la mujer en una posici n de supeditaci n o sometimiento al hombre
5873857 la complicidad de los hombres en el rechazo contra la violencia de g nero y especialmente contra los maltratadores
5873858 este es un gobierno de los derechos humanos y nunca ser represor
5873859 sirve para mantener la legitimidad de los invasores y sus valores culturales
5873860 no es que se olvida las violaciones y las agresiones de colombia ni de estados unidos por supuesto ni del presidente uribe sino que es un gesto de que sabemos lo que ustedes han hecho pero vamos a dar un paso no de olvidar sino de decir vamos a seguir adelante a ver como podemos relacionarnos hay que aceptar un hecho y es que todos son pa ses vecinos ma ana no se va uribe entonces venezuela tiene que convivir con colombia y busca la f rmula para hacerlo

5873863 uribe es un operador del imperio de estados unidos en esta regi n a pesar de que el mismo dijo ayer que vamos a dejar de hablar de imperialismo y que colombia act a de manera aut noma entonces promueve seg n uribe un plan imperialista en la regi n al final su discurso era tan vac o que despu s en pocas palabras tuvo que admitir que el plan colombia lo tienen ah y eso no nada m s que un plan de reforzar y asegurar el poder de control militar de estados unidos en la regi n

5873869 se trata de una facilitaci n que se remonta a 2001 en relaci n a dos personas de una compa a suiza

5873872 el comit internacional de la cruz roja cicr toma nota de la declaraci n del presidente de la rep blica lvaro uribe v lez seg n la cual reconoce que un oficial de la fuerza p blica que particip en la operaci n jaque port un peto con el logo logotipo del cicr y el emblema de la cruz roja
5873873 debe tener la confianza de todas las partes en conflicto para llevar a cabo su acci n humanitaria
5873874 unoficial equivocadamente y contrariando las rdenes dadas reconoci que producto de su nerviosismo al observar la cantidad de guerrilleros armados alrededor del helic ptero se puso sobre su chaleco un peto de tela que llevaba el s mbolo del comit internacional de la cruz roja
5873875 le vamos a pedir s a este oficial que tenga un gesto de valor y le pida a sus compa eros de operaci n que le perdonen que as como nosotros en el gobierno pedimos al comit internacional de la cruz roja que nos perdone l tambi n lo haga
5873876 he solicitado al general freddy padilla de le n comandante de las fuerzas militares despu s de las investigaciones jur dicas que dada la circunstancia de que nuestros hombres no iban armados no dispararon no pod an hacerlo los grupos contingentes que ten amos cerca no dispararon contra los guerrilleros que quedaron en tierra dado el hecho de que el oficial ha reconocido ante sus superiores el error que cometi y dados otros elementos jur dicos no lo debemos sancionar asumo la responsabilidad
5873877 muchos compatriotas me han preguntado y usted por qu asume las responsabilidades es la nica manera de construir confianza si el presidente de la rep blica comandante de las fuerzas armadas no asume las responsabilidades no se crea en las fuerzas armadas y en cada uno de los integrantes ese acervo de confianza que se requiere para que tomen estas iniciativas y para darle definitivamente la paz a colombia
5873878 eluso indebido del signo de la cruz roja constituye una infracci n del art culo 38 del protocolo i adicional a los convenios de ginebra instrumento internacional que seg n la jurisprudencia colombiana es aplicable a nuestro conflicto armado interno
5873879 para el dih el signo de la cruz roja se usa indebidamente cuando personas que toman parte directa en las hostilidades lo emplean para simular el estatuto de protecci n que los convenios de ginebra otorgan a quienes dentro de un conflicto armado no deben ser objeto de ataques
5873880 cuandoel uso indebido del signo de la cruz roja sirve como medio para matar herir o capturar a un integrante del bando enemigo estamos en presencia de un caso de perfidia
5873881 as lo sostienen tratadistas como el profesor pietro verri en su obra diccionario de derecho internacional de los conflictos armados
5873882 de conformidad con lo establecido por el art culo 8 del estatuto de roma que rige a la corte penal internacional la utilizaci n indebida de los emblemas distintivos de los convenios de ginebra s lo constituye crimen de guerra si con ello se causa la muerte o lesiones graves
5873883 ens ntesis frente al caso que nos ocupa debe hablarse de infracci n al dih y no de crimen de guerra
5873884 si las farc quieren la paz deben deponer las armas
5873885 si esa es la propuesta del gobierno que mejor no pierda el tiempo con la guerrilla incluso ni con el eln
5873886 no hay que perder de vista con un nimo triunfalista e iluso que un conflicto de m s de cuatro d cadas no se resuelve con afirmaciones o decisiones arbitrarias que no consultan la realidad hist rica social y pol tica del pa s
5873887 aqu debe haber una negociaci n pol tica distinta m s realista por supuesto la guerrilla debe entender que la negociaci n se d sobre unos temas muy concretos que conduzcan por supuesto a la desmovilizaci n pero sobre la base de un previo acuerdo pol tico

5873893 es preciso aclarar que los datos que suministra el icbf corresponden solamente a los ni os que son reportados al instituto y por tanto ingresan al programa

5873895 preocupaci n por el reducido n mero de ni os y ni as desvinculados que fueron entregados al bienestar familiar por las antiguas autodefensas en las desmovilizaciones
5873896 todav a hay menores que se presentan al icbf para ingresar al programa y que aparentemente fueron enviados a sus casas por los comandantes d as antes de la desmovilizaci n
5873897 a otros los cambiaron de regiones y a la mayor a los devolvieron a sus casas para invisibilizarlos
5873898 las omisiones a las obligaciones legales de protecci n rehabilitaci n y acceso a la justicia de los menores desvinculados en las negociaciones de paz realizadas con las auc
5873899 la reserva que puso colombia en este aspecto cr menes de guerra se vence el pr ximo a o la comunidad internacional s est muy atenta a esto y va a haber consecuencias en el futuro sin ninguna duda es un tema que va a ser materia de preocupaci n del comit de derechos del ni o de la onu y probablemente tambi n de otros tribunales como la corte interamericana

5874029 but the great security against a gradual concentration of the several powers in the same department consists in giving to those who administer each department the necessary constitutional means and personal motives to resist encroachments of the others the provision for defense must in this as in all other cases be made commensurate to the danger of attack ambition must be made to counteract ambition the interest of the man must be connected with the constitutional rights of the place it may be a reflection on human nature that such devices should be necessary to control the abuses of government but what is government itself but the greatest of all reflections on human nature if men were angels no government would be necessary if angels were to govern men neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary in framing a government which is to be administered by men over men the great difficulty lies in this you must first enable the government to control the governed and in the next place oblige it to control itself a dependence on the people is no doubt the primary control on the government but experience has taught mankind the necessity of auxiliary precautions

5874034 a blind trust businesswise is not very different from this grantor trust but youre taxed on passive income versus income
5874035 identification of each trust asset if known to the beneficiary from which income was received by the beneficiary in excess of 500

5874040 on july 10 1822 james madison sent a letter to to edward livingston about the appropriate relationship between religion and government
5874041 there remains a strong bias towards the old error that without some sort of alliance or coalition between government and religion neither can be duly supported
5874042 every new and successful example therefore of a perfect separation between ecclesiastical and civil matters is of importance
5874043 and i have no doubt that every new example will succeed as every past one has done in showing that religion and government will both exist in greater purity the less they are mixed together
5874044 zanesville ohio senator barack obama said tuesday that if elected president he would expand the delivery of social services through churches and other religious organizations vowing to achieve a goal he said president bush had fallen short on during his two terms in embracing the same general approach as mr bush mr obama ran the political risk of alienating those of his supporters who would prefer that government keep its distance from religion

5874176 this is where you tell me how i dont know how thin fine and stick straight your hair is
5874177 i do but no you shouldnt need one if you have the right haircut
5874178 hair should be in proportion to your face and to the rest of you save the very big or the very flat hair for the very young and proportionate balanced fullness and shape will help lift an aging face and body
5874179 youre always pulling it back and rarely wear it down you keep fluffing it whenever you look in the mirror
5874180 dewy just looks shiny to me it is pretty on younger skin but it only seems to reveal the pores and wrinkles on older skin
5874181 having your brows tweezed where you need less and penciled or powdered where you need more will make the biggest difference not only now but as you age next to a good bra its the best thing you can do for a lift
5874182 bright or dark lipstick is aging soft natural and pale lips are more youthful

5874191 el reconocimiento de los rostros lo logran sin esfuerzo personas de todas las culturas diferentes y por ello se consideraba como un mecanismo universal entre los humanos
5874192 sin embargo el uso de una novedosa tecnolog a de imagen cerebral ha permitido el descubrimiento de que las diferencias culturales causan que miremos a los rostros de manera distinta
5874193 demuestran que el procesamiento de rostros no puede considerarse como algo que surge de una serie universal de eventos perceptuales
5874194 la estrategia empleada para extraer informaci n visual de los rostros difiere con las culturas
5874195 en una serie de estudios del movimiento de los ojos mostramos que la experiencia social tiene un impacto sobre la forma en que las personas miran a los rostros
5874196 espec ficamente notamos una gran diferencia en los movimientos de los observadores occidentales y los del este de asia
5874197 encontramos que los occidentales tienden a mirar rasgos espec ficos en el rostro de un individuo tales como los ojos o la boca en tanto que los observadores del este de asia tienden a enfocarse en la nariz o el centro de la cara lo cual da una visi n m s general de todos los rasgos
5874198 el excesivo contacto directo de ojos puede considerarse rudo en las culturas de asia oriental
5874199 brinda nuevos elementos para entender por qu la comunicaci n no verbal entre personas de culturas diferentes a veces es problem tica
5874200 en una era en la cual la globalizaci n ha incrementado enormemente la interdependencia la integraci n y la interacci n entre personas y corporaciones de todo el mundo
5874201 las sociedades occidentales son en general m s individualistas en tanto que las sociedades orientales son colectivistas los occidentales al parecer piensan y perciben de manera m s enfocada y los orientales globalmente
5874202 al refutar la presunci n tradicional de que el procesamiento de rostros se logra de una manera universal hemos mostrado que el ambiente incluida la sociedad en la cual nos desarrollamos tiene mucha influencia en los mecanismos humanos b sicos
5874203 ive been a huge merle haggard fan since i was a kid
5874204 he was a god in our household so when he asked me to sing thats the way love goes and silver wings for his album of number ones years ago i was of course thrilled when i got out on tour brad told me he saw merle and i sing thats the way love goes back in 1999 at the cmas and asked if i would like to sing it with him during his set of course i was excited and said yes

5874209 and looking back if this album had come out soon after my first album in 2003 there are so many songs that would not have been written and so many experiences would not have been had if i had not gone through the waiting and the trials that i went through in the past few years songs like where youre going and kerosene kid would not have been written i did a lot of reflection on my past and where i am now during the downtime and all of that is reflected on this album

5874225 the suggestion that obama the proud father of two little girls and others who opposed these bills supported infanticide is deeply offensive and insulting

5874316 the behaviorist in me wanted to know why these things happened what brought the dogs to this point why did the bond fail what really happened the cop in me rebelled realizing that these were actually homicide cases that deserved the same investigative detail as any homicide especially if there was ever going to be any real chance of holding the humans involved responsible for the issues that actually caused the attacks
5874317 the bite marks proved two things one that the doberman mix had actually administered the fatal bites and that the dogs had simply been playing tug of war with an unknown new toy the infant

5874331 seldom has so much fire energy enthusiasm money everything gone into anything as into serbia in the months before milosevic went
5874332 those who had announced widespread fraud like eu foreign policy chief javier solana have been proved wrong
5874333 did everything in its power to ensure that people were able to cast their votes without intimidation and in an orderly manner
5874334 we received many first hand reports from people who stated that they had been threatened by djukanovic supporters with the loss of their jobs if they turned out to vote
5874335 countless refugees from kosovo had been deliberately excluded from the electoral lists in montenegro
5874336 could only conclude that these tactics of intimidation and disenfranchisement were designed to benefit the so called democratic opposition
5874337 were satisfied that virtually no large scale falsification of the election in yugoslavia was possible

5874397 the uk has one of the toughest borders in the world and we are determined to ensure it stays that way
5874398 our hi tech electronic borders system will allow us to count all foreign nationals in and out of the uk while checking them against watch lists
5874399 these checks make up just one part of britains triple ring of security alongside fingerprint visas for three quarters of the worlds population and the roll out of id cards for foreign nationals locking people to one identity
5874400 this is untried untested technology and theyre going live with it before theyve been able to recognise any of the difficulties there might be with the system

5874410 ive been sailing back from port stephens and came in late last night and woke up this morning to a strange sucking sound at the bottom of the boat
5874411 it sounds quite pathetic like someone with a great vacuum cleaner trying to suck the bottom of the boat
5874412 i just didnt want to start the boat or do anything to hurt the whale
5874413 if it was smaller perhaps but this is too big and too specialised in its nutritional needs
5874414 its absolutely the case that we havent given up on this little whale

5874416 she judged what she saw and she believes that the gymnasts were ranked correctly this is not the first time that valeri liukin has targeted australian judges and he obviously looks at the judge who has not given the result he wants for his daughter
5874417 if shed got the gold medal he wouldnt be noticing helens judging but the result is not what he likes so he then goes looking for a scapegoat
5874418 helen is our best and most senior judge shes very fair shes unbiased if valeri liukin disagrees with the scores then we respect that but he should respect helens ability australia doesnt appreciate helens judging being targeted she has our total support

5874436 lessons in the alexander technique offer an individualised approach to develop skills that help people recognise understand and avoid poor habits affecting postural tone and neuromuscular coordination
5874437 it can potentially reduce back pain by limiting muscle spasm strengthening postural muscles improving coordination and flexibility and decompressing the spine
5874438 there is little evidence available about the effectiveness of the alexander technique so this research is welcome
5874439 the alexander technique is something we do recommend and the feedback we have got is good

5874442 i think these guys now see especially at this young age that you have to be able to play great ball to succeed at a higher level
5874443 if you have any plans of playing beyond the maine level you have to adjust to a better style of ball its more aggressive
5874444 there was just one single aspect of the game that got us at new englands and that was pitching
5874445 we had two arms that we relied on chandler crans and caleb mcfarland neither one of them were at 100 percent but that is no excuse you have to have four or five kids capable of pitching like those two
5874446 from curves to changeups to knuckles you can only do so much to prepare for that in a short period of time we dont see that kind of pitching in our league we see straight fastballs with a few curves
5874447 without exaggerating we saw 75 80 percent off speed curves and changeups
5874448 a number of people told me they saw that commercial the kids were all excited
5874449 at the time it was raining in the village quite cold and the conditions were very difficult dr forster said
5874450 the village community and local government had done a lot to try to find him but they had been unable to locate him
5874451 when they found him his condition wasnt good he was very weak and sick and obviously cold because he had been exposed to the cool weather over the last few days dr forster said
5874452 we will be looking at different ways to support the community particularly the office in terms of possibly putting up signs or providing training to the local guides to thank them for all their help dr forster said
5874453 currently the hospitals use a standard test to work out how far the cancer has progressed and then they use this to determine the treatment the patient should receive
5874454 however we are potentially able to more accurately predict who would benefit from chemotherapy
5874455 chemotherapy can be very useful but can have a number of side effects so we only want to use it where we think theres a good chance it will help this test will help us determine that
5874456 there is a desperate need for more effective treatments for bowel cancer the problem is identifying which cancers need which treatments this discovery may show us the way to do that and help save a lot of lives
5874457 yeah but this is a tragedy this is a tragedy how can i keep handling this
5874458 it has been another outstanding day and a great gold medal on the track by christine who ran a fantastic race
5874459 you never think its a reality its something you dream about as i came across the line i thought oh my gosh i dont know what to say
5874460 it just feels unbelievable its going to take a while to sink in but wow
5874461 it doesnt feel real yet im so glad im part of it
5874462 i was vaguely aware of the history people tell you about it but i tried to make it the furthest thought from my mind
5874463 and thats why the emotions come out at the end you bottle it for so long that it just erupts at the end
5874464 peculiar to christs sacrifice are the infinite value of victim which give the sacrifice an infinite value of expiation and as merit

5874473 there are vulnerabilities all around the australian coastline she said
5874474 it is an issue of significant magnitude and it does need proper assessment and all governments working together to minimise the risks and ensure there is as little damage as possible
5874475 this really is very early work and many more factors need to be taken into account before we have concrete projections she said
5874476 it is going to be a negative story leading to damage of assets and loss of value
5874477 the evidence over the past 12 to 18 months suggests that we have underestimated how fast this aspect of the earths system can change he said
5874478 most complex and difficult challenge we have faced as a species
5874479 in the 21st century a sea level rise of at least 0 5 metres is a certainty a rise of 1 to 1 5 metres is more likely while a rise of up to four metres this century is possible he said
5874480 the pressing reality of climate change is upon us and all the evidence points to coastlines being the most vulnerable she said adding that there would be considerable damage to coastal settlements in particular aboriginal communities
5874481 this is an exciting new approach to geothermal that could meet thousands of times us energy needs
5874482 its 24 7 its potentially developable all over the country and for all that we really do think it could be the killer app of the energy world
5874483 schemes such as this together with cleaner coal gas and new nuclear will help us to keep the uks lights on while reducing carbon emissions and ensuring energy is as affordable as possible for our customers
5874484 e on does have investment in renewables and they are pushing forward this scheme we want them to go down this road and use that expertise and technology and stop cancelling it out by pushing forward a coal fired power station
5874485 this discrepancy may have profound consequences on the ability of species to cope with climate change in the long run
5874486 he said he was under great pressure from scientology and if we didnt stop poking at them hed have to leave
5874487 practice has been going great so far and i think weve done a really good job of trying to focus on and build off the fundamentals of the game
5874488 coming into the preseason were in the best shape weve ever been in so everyone did their homework over the summer and were all really excited to get to work
5874489 whats probably impressed a lot of people or shocked a lot of people and i dont know why but hes been playing solid defense
5874490 the other night he did a phenomenal job on dirk nowitzki people try to criticize him about that but hes been doing a phenomenal job defensively for us
5874491 we know how it is to come on a team like this with 12 of the best players in the world and not have to score 30 points a night we dream about the day that we can play on our own respective nba team and not have to score 30 a night and hope to get a win
5874492 they play 44 minutes every other night its hard to play that many minutes in three or four games a week and play both offensively and defensively its very difficult all of these guys when you watch them theyre putting most of their energy on the offensive end thats what their teams need here we dont need that
5874493 we know that we can score the ball better than anybody out there in the world but if we dont stop nobody on this team we dont win

5874510 we complement each other we stimulate each others business rather than compete

5874512 my intention is to journey to the basement below the superintendants residence where dick is hiding out
5874513 your spirit self will remain invisible as long as you dont hesitate
5874514 when youve had enough return to this elevator and press ground ill be here
5874515 joining forces to destroy this world of sin and delusion this evil fallen realm because if you stop and think about it your madness and the christo fascist project are fundamentally the same forgive my pun but do you see what im driving at they complement each other they need each other and together theyll get the job done ten times faster its the revenge of two creeds which are more alike than you may be willing to admit osama just think the rapture and total jihad what a killer combination a huge conflagration of oil and fanaticism working together we can bring on the apocalypse in record time
5874516 but forgive me im assuming youre familiar with the apocalypse in the book of revelation maybe youre not the new testament osama you know armageddon 666 the end of time the coming of the anti christ
5874517 well you should read the book of revelation sometime its right up your alley
5874518 and i stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads and ten horns and upon his horns ten crowns and upon his heads the name of blasphemy
5874519 hot stuff isnt it see the beast is the anti christ come to deceive by means of miracles those who dwell on earth and which miracles do you suppose this refers to which miracles is the anti christ deceiving us with the miracles of soulless technology thats what the miracles of nuclear warheads and genetic engineering and dioxin
5874520 and he causeth all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their foreheads
5874521 sorta like what me and my corporate buddies are doing only weve modernized things we no longer live in biblical times thank god all that moralistic thrashing around is outdated instead of 666 weve come up with something for the mark of the beast thats totally contemporary something in keeping with the consumerism sweeping the planet we gotta use what the public can relate to right so guess what it is
5874522 the bar code you know the marketing tool imprinted on every product sold around the world even in saudi arabia dude thats the new mark of the beast
5874523 isnt that a stroke of genius and theres something else thats different this time around the mark doesnt come from satan or from christ either for that matter it comes
5874524 look out the window my desert flower isnt the light beautiful now thats the golden glow of twilight the magical time betwixt and between when nothings what it appears to be its the end of the day osama that light in the window is calling us to take advantage to seize the moment we have a golden opportunity we mustnt pass up a chance to work together to realize the goals we share even our supposed doctrinal differences are a mirage christianity and islam and judaism too for that matter be honest theyre all austere desert religions with jealous gods at the helm founded on a guilt ridden rejection of life the story lines of the two fundamentalisms sweeping over the world may be different but ultimately the drift is exactly the same do you understand
5874525 i mean im asking you to put aside the content of your beliefs and consider only their structure you must begin to think structurally osama its the only way to go for example take the koran and the bible their content is secondary whats important is the fact that theyre both holy books do you see where the word of god appears in chapter and verse allowing any knucklehead to turn to this passage or that in order to justify whatever agenda he has in mind just like the jews and the christians and the moslems do and down through history the result has been an endless bloodbath thats because structurally theyre identical be brave admit it
5874526 stop that gibberish will you you know i dont understand a word worse than that it grates on my ears im getting heart palpitations only english spoken here
5874527 youre so fucking literal minded talk about pearls before swine
5874528 oh grand mufti im going to spell this out for you one last time so please listen carefully we need to come to an agreement you and i the stakes are much too high for you to persist in your myopia
5874529 theyre all so caught up in being pure its maddening as if theyve each got the one and only direct pipeline to god
5874530 correct me if im wrong osama we both want to see this corrupt freakshow wiped clean off the face of the earth we both condemn our enemies without a glimmer of mercy we both will go to any lengths to realize our aims although i must say your style is repugnant in its crudity dont you see that from a public relations point of view youre shooting yourself in the foot why slaughter innocent people there are more refined ways to go about getting what you want but thats neither here nor there things have gone too far for you to change direction in spite of your boorishness we can still work together in fact we already are but consciously working together is another story entirely because fundamentalism is fundamentalism regardless of the fine print its all about denial of life denial of pleasure denial of space combining two claustrophobic visions is a masterstroke truly formidable dont you see it sucks all the air out of the world well come at the general public from both sides they wont know what hit them
5874531 9 11 youre talking rubbish you big baboon save your propaganda for the faithful you act like youve got the whole world quaking in its boots well what if i told you that youre just a pawn in our game
5874532 you can be honest with me osama no one else is listening admit that deep down you have no idea who or what was responsible for 9 ll youre as much in the dark as the people who died that day you think you pulled a fast one but it just fell in your lap coldblooded murderer that you are you may have planned what took place you may have recruited those poor automatons but have you ever stopped to consider how such an opportunity arose in the first place who lifted the rock that let you crawl out into the light of day how could a pissant bunch of disorganized fanatics losers really penetrate the greatest security curtain the world has ever known with absolutely no resistance answer that before you start bragging to me about your gruesome exploits because the fact is 9 11 took place deep inside a dream out of your control and the same holds true for us what compelled the american government against all common sense to plunk down military bases on what millions of moslems call holy ground thereby giving you the opening you needed
5874533 you want everybody to think youre big and bad and evil but underneath all the bluster youre lost lost just like people in this country are lost these conspiracy theorists saying it was israeli agents or the c i a pathetic the fact is nobody knows how it happened because nobody knows why this world is destroying itself nobody knows why two rabid fundamentalisms are torching civilization nobody knows why were going to war in iraq nobody knows why the israelis and the palestinians cant stop killing each other nobody knows why greed and cruelty have absconded with human reason your suicide bombers are no more than crazed addicts driven insane by hatred and youre worse selfishly taking advantage of that hatred using it for your own ends far from presiding over a band of courageous warriors you distort your religion to send these nut cases over the edge deep down you know that what youre doing is a crime against humanity but in a larger sense in the grand scheme of things you have no idea what youre doing because you have no idea of the forces arrayed against you this is all part of a much bigger picture so much bigger than you and your narrow 12th century mindset that you cant even begin to conceive of it a profound intelligence is looking down on you and laughing do you hear the laughter osama there are beings in the universe infinitely more evolved than you theyre feeding on the fear generated on this planet by the likes of you and your enemies theyre the ones calling the shots from above and beyond like i said before from outer space now do you understand
5874534 dearest one are you hurt what a fool i am i came on way too strong please forgive me can you breathe should i try mouth to mouth resuscitation or what about water are you thirsty say something

5874540 one can never consent to creep when one feels an impulse to soar
5874541 i dont really care what people think or what people say
5874542 as far as i am concerned i am here and i won a gold medal they can say what they like but i really dont care
5874543 why should this be spoiled unless someone tries to im very happy with myself im very happy that i have picked up three gold medals in three major championships
5874544 i needed to sort my head out i felt tired i hadnt slept for the past two nights and the pressure was getting to me but i just thought keep going you can win
5874545 i am very busy and busy means i get a bit scatterbrained and that is just how i am i am not going to beat myself over it the mistake was made and you just move on
5874546 i didnt realise what people were saying until my brother called me and naturally it upset me

5874553 a lot of the procedural issues necessary for instant replay to be implemented need to be worked out
5874554 major league baseball needs to step up to the plate and iron out these issues
5874555 im not going to go through these one by one i will tell you that on a number of them the comments are simply not accurate
5874556 for example weve had an understanding with the wua for some time that the crew chief and the crew chief only would be the one responsible for reviewing the video and making the decision on instant replay
5874557 there are other issues that remain to be worked out it is my general policy that i dont comment when im trying to bargain but i remain confident that were gong to be able to make a deal
5874558 thus there will be a lack of transparency and obviousness for the public as to what is going on when instant replay is under way
5874559 there may be situations where the umpires will have to leave the field in shifts so that everyone can view the video while leaving the requisite number of umpires on the field
5874560 this could create a laurel and hardy effect and may cause delay of game problems

5874562 the umpires raised concerns and brought potential problems to solomons attention at least six weeks ago

5874797 we hope it doesnt hit a crisis point but i am fairly certain it will
5874798 we are going to be reasonable about this but if they cause us significant delay that could be grounds for arrest
5874799 during the recent operations in basra sadr city and maysan iraqi troops uncovered convincing evidence that iranian lethal aid has continued to flow into iraq
5874800 whereas iran has proved time and again its good intention to help iraqs stabilisation development and prosperity through close cooperation with the iraqi government in different fields as well as to help iraqi people overcome their immense difficulties the u s government unwarrantedly insists on its unacceptable behaviour in scape goating others including iran for its own wrong policies in iraq
5874801 the continuation of the presence of foreign forces in the country and certain wring policies and practices on the part of foreign forces there
5874802 there is a mechanism which is agreed between iraq and these countries on what these countries can do through the meeting of interior ministers of these countries through the expanded neighbouring countries conferences which took place in kuwait and anther one that is going to take place in jordan in fall
5874803 we are going to continue these negotiations through diplomatic channels
5874804 we hope that any improvement in the relationship between iran and the u s will help the situation in iraq
5874805 it is noteworthy that despite these groundless allegations to date no single credible evidence has ever been presented to substantiate them
5874806 to the contrary several high ranking iraqi officials are on record stressing irans constructive role in the country and rejecting the solid allegation
5874807 the united states accuses iran because the two countries have as yet not resolved their outstanding disputes
5874808 the accusation is designed to stem irans rising regional influence which the u s itself helped to enhance by overthrowing two of the islamic republics most implacable enemies the taliban and saddam hussein regimes
5874809 in addition during these operations numerous jish al mahdi militia fighters and leaders of jish al mahdi associated highly trained special groups fled to iran where they received sanctuary
5874810 as far as the u s is concerned the accusation has the advantage of undermining irans image in the eyes of iraqi shiites by blaming iran for the nefarious activities of the discredited elements in the mahdi army
5874811 the allegations are also designed to provide credence for americas narrative that depicts iran as a deceitful untrustworthy and hypocritical power which while professing to support the central government in baghdad trains funds and arms iraqi prime minister nouri enemies
5874812 irans role in iraq is a by product of u s iran relations
5874813 when u s iran relations have stalled irans role in iraq would likely be unconstructive and when u s iran relations are cooperative then irans role in iraq might be cooperative it doesnt necessarily mean that the u s has to pull out from iraq
5874814 the security situation has improved not simply because of the surge but because of a host of other factors including the successful completion of ethnic cleansing in key areas and americas success in buying off former sunni insurgents
5874815 economic conditions the improving performance of the iraqi military the decision on the part of iran to lend greater support to the iraqi central government instead of shiite militias as well as blunders on the part of al qaeda and setbacks suffered by moqtada al sadr

5874824 the central bank uses u s dollars to purchase afghan currency on the open market
5874825 this allows the central bank access to foreign currency reserves which are necessary to the legitimacy of the central bank in the eyes of the international monetary fund and the world bank organization
5874826 the more confidence we can build in afghan banks the more vendors will utilize them for payment via electronic funds transfers
5874827 this new process paves the way for u s forces to utilize private banks in afghanistan for commercial services this is vital because previously the central bank provided commercial services to our forces

5874832 gigastor sas customers have so far been either government or financial organizations with extremely large storage and or long term data retention needs
5874833 the larger storage needs are due to either high network volumes or regulations that mandate and govern long term data retention coupled with the trend to consolidate activities into larger data centers customer demand for larger scalable solutions will continue to increase
5874834 stamp duty is a one off charge whereas registration comes off annually and it really would make much more of a difference
5874835 the most significant result of this policy will be to attract people to the lower emitting vehicles
5874836 theyre putting up the duty on the humble ute theyre making things like the lotus elise and lexus and mercedes benz cheaper to buy
5874837 almost all manufacturers provide a full range of vehicles to meet different needs within the community

5874880 by the way gary rose had nothing to do with the legislature passing the aquarium bill
5874881 i believe he rose should not have been involved thats a different kind of conflict
5874882 i found this surprising that this information came out as it did as opposed to earlier in the xanadu process
5874883 if he is concerned about any appearance we ought to know at the beginning

5874889 even though they crushed us in pool play were just going to keep fighting as a team
5874890 if we can just pass a little better touch a few more balls and get in cubas head a little bit they can break down like any team
5874891 i never imagined being here and playing the match we did

5874907 por ello me gustar a poder tener minutos y tener opciones de poder jugar en esa demarcaci n
5874908 weve got to protect the football and really just take our shots when we can get them
5874909 we think we can control the tempo with our back its not that wide open go get em kind of thing which is a risky offense
5874910 got great command of the offense he runs and also of the players because they know that if they pay close attention and do what he says theyll be productive and make plays
5874911 if that wasnt the case i wouldnt be here in san francisco
5874912 we know guatemala are a very difficult team to play at home
5874913 ive been considered by a new coach the fight for a starting place will be tough so the team will benefit our goal is to win all our games at home
5874914 ive seen over 30 leases and there are problems with every one

5874918 the flora and fauna around us are shifting over time due to
5874919 the result is desynchronisation if birds and the insects upon which they depend do not react in the same way we are headed for an upheaval in the interaction between species
5874920 the response is faster than we thought but it is still not fast enough to keep up with climate change
5874921 is most likely changing at its maximal possible rate which is insufficient to catch up to climate change
5874922 this discrepancy may have profound consequences on the ability of species to cope with climate change in the long run
5874923 if you are going to behave like an authoritarian state we are not going to accept your leaders and your elites
5874924 we orignally wanted sunshine orange but they gave us mac n cheese orange but hey

5874928 there are so many variables in bringing a production to broadway theatre availability artists schedules and securing capitalization to name but a few
5874929 its impossible not to be cognizant of the national economy and its potential impact on the theatre but its also premature to say whether the recent changes in plans by certain shows represent a trend especially as were likely to see other productions quickly step up to fill the available theatres in their stead
5874930 speed the plow is a play about glamour sex and power and takes place in hollywood
5874931 i think speed the plow is less familiar than american buffalo and was overshadowed by madonna being part of the original production

5874936 i did quite a few run throughs to practise and whilst banking on one such run the engine cut out i had no steering i therefore continued in a straight line directly into a wooden boat house
5874937 there i was as a fearless 007 hobbling on a cane to my boat and then pretending to be indestructible for the cameras who says i cant act
5874938 he was a huge bond fan and said that he would love to direct one of the films

5874941 the four seasons are blue collar kids who had a dream and it sort of crosses all barriers and boundaries

5874943 as far as the auditions went there were endless endless times when i was turned down so i did struggle but i also was able to achieve great things
5874944 you have to have tough love with all these young people because it takes a lot of hard work and some of them think that its just overnight

5874960 was able to feel that it seemed mostly firm but unusually hollow in one small section
5874961 once he perpetrated a fraud that goes into his credibility and integrity mr turner said
5874962 big cats and dinosaurs if you see any of those give us a call
5874963 later that day tom biscardi informed us that both matthew whitton and ricky dyer admitted it was a costume
5874964 the agriculture industry will have a role to play in this system because it is recognized that the industry can initiate projects that will sequester carbon
5874965 we would look at anything that would increase the revenue stream for those in agriculture as a positive
5874966 ontario is dealing with the most diverse agriculture there is in canada we have to be cautious that a carbon credit program is a benefit to ontario producers not just a specific sector
5874967 were going to just have to wait and see like everyone else
5874968 as it becomes more developed our opinions and policies will become more developed as well
5874969 this government has been consulting with industry so well i would think that they would consult on the point that the people they really need to hit is big industries what farmers put in even from dairy cattle or big cattle is minimal to what big industries put in

5874977 at least obama has an energy plan thats more than i can say for mccain and the repubs
5874978 the huge crowds and stirring but vague reform rhetoric dont give voters anything they can take home in their pocket this has lead to some high profile failures at a health care forum in nevada and with firefighters in washington in venues where audiences wanted to hear specifics about ideas that will change their lives obamas rhetoric makes this task more difficult he presents himself as a paradigm shifting candidate which means people are expecting to be floored not just by his charisma but by his ideas
5874979 i gather you dont like either candidate so will you vote
5874980 i gave him the best year of my life he took a part of me
5874981 with skyrocketing gas prices it is clear that the american people can no longer afford the republican rubber stamp congress
5874982 democrats have a commonsense plan to help bring down skyrocketing gas prices by cracking down on price gouging
5874983 running along the street grabbing any and every girl in sight
5874984 i was running ahead of him with my leica looking back over my shoulder then suddenly in a flash i saw something white being grabbed i turned around and clicked the moment the sailor kissed the nurse
5874985 ive been through counseling ive been through sexual abuse recovery groups to deal with this this man has destroyed my life
5874986 he asked me how modest are you and i said im pretty modest and he proceeded to lift up my shirt from the bottom reach under my bra and begin to fondle or massage my breasts
5874987 i went to see him because i got in a car accident
5874988 he started feeling the back of my neck and said my lymph nodes were swollen and then he proceeded to ask me how modest i was
5874989 he started off on my neck and then he goes down to my lower abdominal area and then just out of nowhere lifts my shirt and bra
5874990 i think the exam by dr koehler happened exactly like the complainants stated
5874991 he would check the young ladies lymph nodes and then while his hand was on the side of the breast say
5874992 your lymphnodes are not in your breast theyre under your arm and thats where he crossed the line
5874993 i do know that i have never touched anyone in an improper manner i have have never massaged breasts i have never fondled anyone
5874994 the technique that would have been used on the patients is a very simple and fast technique i quit it immediately after the first complaint was received there is never any exposure of the skin and never any contact with any part of the body except the armpit area no clothes are removed
5874995 i mean i feel like he molested me he fondled me he violated me sexually
5874996 i regret that the agency was unable to pursue and resolve your complaint in a timely fashion that speaks to a failure by the agency and the office of the attorney general to resolve this case in a timely fashion and not to any shortcomings on your part
5874997 i think im sorry but i think its a joke they say that theyre out to protect people and when you file a complaint its going to be taken care of in 90 to 125 days its been eight years it has been eight years
5874998 im a the sky is falling type voter who always thinks the worst candidate will win
5874999 the only way he obama can win is if mccain royally screws up
5875000 when asked if obama is a socialist and if the media is biased towards obama he himmed and hawed around the answer instead of being a damn leader

5875005 la verdad me pregunto qu pasa veo la repetici n los comentarios primero digo que no me conocen y a partir de su desconocimiento hablan opinan y ver cualquier jugada en futbol en c mara lenta no tiene ning n punto de comparaci n con la realidad y mil sima de segundo en que se desarrolla cada movimiento de futbol
5875006 lo primero que se les ocurri decir es que si a horacio cervantes le dieron tres fechas a esta jugada tiene que ser m nimo tres o cuatro eso me da para pensar que tiene otro fondo no s lo la jugada que no miden s lo la intenci n miden todo el espect culo estamos acostumbrados a recibir golpes del mismo lugar
5875007 esto es un negocio son dos televisoras importantes que siempre est n disput ndose cosas extrafutbol sticas en medio estuvo la expulsi n de cervantes no s quien present el video o c mo se lleg a la determinaci n de que le dieran tres fechas

5875018 se defini en conjunto el grupo lo platic conmigo no lo determinaron unos cuantos ellos expresaron su deseo por continuar creciendo en solitario y atender asuntos personales
5875019 es el resultado de la emoci n que genera dejar un grupo tan importante que logr cautivar a la gente de una manera tan especial
5875020 la ventas van muy bien lo que est sucediendo no ser a real en caso de que ellos no tuvieran el xito que mantienen hay una p gina en la que se est n recolectando firmas para que el grupo no se desintegre y rebasan los tres millones esa reacci n mundial es un apoyo definitivo de los fans
5875021 why people wonder cant zorn and his assistants be more complimentary wheres the love in a 17 of 23 three touchdown no interception start but they are missing the message the love is there if only you know where to look what coaches especially those at the college and pro levels say is one thing what they mean can be quite another

5875023 great im a first year head coach and because of this rookie i could have a quarterback controversy on my hands in september
5875024 he has to become a more disciplined qb not risk as much as he risked in the game this week it turned out to be a great performance but it could easily have been the other way

5875046 our nation suffers from a fiscal cancer that threatens the future economic well being of our country children and grandchildren
5875047 this isnt just a financial issue its a moral issue it is immoral to keep kicking this can down the road for younger generations to grapple with its time for real action rather than more rhetoric
5875048 i o u s a live with warren buffett pete peterson amp dave walker
5875049 the challenge for west virginia the challenge for coal producing states and nations is that as historically produced coal is a dirty fuel and is regarded as a dirty fuel
5875050 and there are environmental issues associated with the production and consumption of coal
5875051 if you want to do energy well in an environmentally sound fashion go to west virginia go to appalachia
5875052 we all win in that equation thats our great opportunity
5875053 the physically reality is that we cannot bridge to the future for decades if not hundreds of years without coal as part of the equation
5875054 if you accept that premise then your choices are how do we do coal well how do we do coal clean how do we capture the opportunities for coal
5875055 carbon sequestration is going to double the cost of coal fired power
5875056 one of the coal presidents said it is at least 15 maybe 20 years away from being commercially viable
5875057 there are a myriad of legal issues that are unresolved whos going to take the liability if it comes back out of the ground and the energy it takes ive heard estimates it could take 15 or 20 of the power of the power plant makes to strip out the co 2 thats going to raise the cost of electricity
5875058 im not sure that we can really appease the individuals that want to see coal eliminated abolished from the energy mix of this country
5875059 but those individuals and groups that have concerns about the environment or the impacts of mining certainly we can be more responsive to those concerns
5875060 right now we dont have a comprehensive bill out there
5875061 we havent been allowed to vote on anything that i think is going to address high gasoline prices and dependence on foreign oil and any time we do get something its a fight to get anything related to coal in there
5875062 its great to have boyfriends or girlfriends there are occasions when you kiss your best friend growing up having fun and goofing about like perfecting your technique
5875063 sometimes it is difficult to know what a politician will actually do once in office because they say different things at different times to different people
5875064 this is a particular problem when a candidate has a short thin record on the issues as in the case of sen obama
5875065 this argument is not about shots to the moon or specific missions in space
5875066 this is a lot more about the economic side of the space program and the high tech high paying jobs that it creates
5875067 while im pleased the issue of space exploration is getting attention from our presidential candidates
5875068 sen mccains record of unwavering support for nasa speaks louder than obamas newfound appreciation for the space program
5875069 cultivate support for americas space program and increase much needed funding
5875070 america benefits when important issues like nasa are debated in a public forum

5875072 we have our own set of rules each golf cart has a number all the neighbors look to see if ours is no 48 going fast with a lot of kids on it
5875073 unfortunately it seems many of our residents and summer residents have purchased golf carts to drive around their little neighborhoods or to go between the cottage and the beach
5875074 tijdens het ek hadden ze daar een geweldige grasmat liggen voor een club die zon prachtig veld inruilt voor kunstgras wil ik niet werken
5875075 ik heb ze gezien tegen heracles almelo en ankaraspor de voorzitter van de club wilde dat ik naar griekenland kwam maar ik zag gewoon te weinig sportieve mogelijkheden ik wacht rustig af tot er iets mooiers komt
5875076 op zijn manier is hij een natuurlijke leider en bij feyenoord heeft hij op mij een goede indruk als aanvoerder gemaakt rafael van der vaart is reserveaanvoerder in moskou voordat ik de tweede aanvoerder definitief kies wil ik de groep eerst nog een paar keer bij elkaar hebben om zo de spelers beter te leren kennen
5875077 het ging over van alles nee ik wil helemaal niet geheimzinnig doen deze dagen gebruik ik om gesprekken te voeren in het hotel op het veld overal
5875078 dat komt door de prijs die we te horen hebben gekregen
5875079 de transfersom ruim tien miljoen euro red die zijn agent noemde nodigt niet echt uit en dan weten we uit ervaring ook dat de prijs van een makelaar vaak lager is dan het bedrag dat een club in gedachte heeft we hebben het daarom in beraad genomen en denken erover na het is een goede voetballer maar het moet wel haalbaar zijn
5875080 we need some tough leadership from the department of defense we need hard decisions that while perhaps not politically correct are correct when it comes to doing what is right for our men and women in combat what is right is what will better prepare our warriors to win and survive on the battlefield not limiting training so we dont run a risk of trampling blades of grass or upsetting the nesting habits of a cockamamie warbler when things go wrong on the battlefield people and the importance of the marine mammal protection act the migratory bird treaty act or the noise control act pale in comparison
5875081 who cares how many species we kill in the the process of eradicating all dissimilar individuals
5875082 we confront more than the usual number of people who dont respond or cant respond people are away from their homes heading back from summer vacation or preparing their children for the start of the school year
5875083 sen obama made it clear that he was really going to get into the nuts and bolts of the kinds of questions oregonians are talking about and i think it has served him well in our state
5875084 im confident that once sen obama gets as well known in these larger states as he has in oregon he is going to see the same success elswhere
5875085 with all eyes on germany this week for the games convention in leipzig the biggest adventure news in recent memory comes quietly from a most unexpected source
5875086 on aug 19 3 14 pm disgusted voter wrote for the most part i think the referendum will be voted down because people dont understand what the hell is going on so they just wont vote leaving the door wide open for the crazies
5875087 half of dems nationwide agree that hillarys act of putting her name in nomination you know that heinous scheming act at the heart of hillarys plot to steal the convention for herself think it will help unify the party only 28 disagree
5875088 the fact that mccain is a westerner from a nearby state will be offset by the democratic mood of the nation thereby making the race really competitive in the west
5875089 if obamas able to win in these states it will have more to do with national trends against the republican party manifesting themselves than with political and demographic changes on the ground
5875090 that national shift has to be great enough to upset the historical pattern of these states tending to vote republican for president
5875091 this has been a difficult year for most of us in many different ways
5875092 the votes going to be tight theres no denying that
5875093 i really think there are enough people who i dont want to say fear barack obama but just dont know him and will end up voting for mccain
5875094 hes focused about the workers and what he wants for our future
5875095 we see him on the news but we dont pay much attention to him
5875096 the gardens are the premier attraction within the city this gives people the opportunity to experience what a traditional maori garden was like and will only add to the appeal
5875097 this beautiful garden will help to conserve and tell the stories of local hapu it will be a major attraction for the people of hamilton the waikato and for the millions who visit hamilton gardens each year
5875098 the concept for this goes way back some people may not think theres anything special about these type of gardens because they are so familiar with them but its time we started to celebrate this part of our countrys culture
5875099 this generation of prosperity had put millions of americans in new homes and millions of new cars on our roads
5875100 president richard nixon also called for greater efficiency standards at the federal level and for exploration of energy using the best options they had at the time extracting oil from shale and tar sands and developing cleaner coal technology
5875101 but when the same demagogues in the middle east who created the supply shortage decided to increase supply once again all the initiatives to use less and produce more energy were abandoned now 36 years later we again face a crisis an oil crisis a carbon crisis and a conservation crisis
5875102 the vehicles we drive have gotten bigger heavier and less efficient our homes have gotten larger and require ever more power to heat and cool our lives have become filled with new technologies that have changed the world for the better but increased the thirst for greater quantities of energy
5875103 this emergency far more complex than the one we faced three and a half decades ago harms our economy threatens our national security and pollutes to our environment
5875104 we are here today to accept the challenge of creating a clean energy revolution
5875105 the imperative is to end the drain of the american treasury both public and private which flow to the hands of volatile governments who control the worlds oil supply ultimately our vision is to bequeath to our children and our childrens children the livable planet that they deserve
5875106 if past is prologue and it is we know that this clean energy revolution will be complicated
5875107 so here in las vegas on august 19 2008 we are gathered gathered to share what we know where we are and what we do next
5875108 today in nevada there are 57 operating renewable energy projects producing 400 megawatts of electricity
5875109 our host the university of nevada las vegas is known for its high energy basketball and in the future it will be known as the leader in clean energy
5875110 look to nearby nellis air force base and you will find the worlds largest photovoltaic plant which provides more than 25 percent of the bases power
5875111 the first geothermal plant in america was built in nevada in 1984
5875112 unfortunately further work this year has been blocked by those creating a distraction by insisting that we talk about nothing but coastal drilling
5875113 even then it will be a drop in the global bucket
5875114 when people in the future look upon the polluted world of 2008 they will see a partnership of two politically differing individuals who came together to show responsible leadership
5875115 oil will be one part of our energy puzzle for years to come as we develop and produce the technologies that will one day render it unnecessary
5875116 congress should pass a long term extension of tax incentives for private sector entrepreneurs who are standing by ready to invest billions of dollars in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects
5875117 all of this will happen if we grasp the enormous economic opportunity this shift to renewables will create
5875118 for example if just 20 percent of our nations power came from renewables by 2020 we would create hundreds of thousands of direct jobs and save consumers many billions of dollars in lower bills
5875119 if we choose to embrace this challenge we can fundamentally change our world which will benefit every creature and person that inhabits it
5875120 we are taking the results and recommendations of this energy summit to the democratic and republican national conventions
5875121 and when we meet again next year i have every expectation that we will do so with a president a congress and a nation finally ready to fully embrace the great energy opportunities that lie ahead
5875122 this species doubtless for some good reason has chosen these islands for its metropolis
5875123 didnt have time and realistically wouldnt be able to make it
5875124 people are going to be coming into the city to see this and be part of it and anything that gets people into the city and opening their wallets gives shops a chance to make sales
5875125 this type of event puts down town hamil town on the map and makes it an item of international interest
5875126 i dont think this fits into that model i certainly dont think the council would be going out of its way to attract or support them
5875127 there are south carolinians who have a vested interest in their government and allegations like this and others against the cia serve to pull away from the real subjects that the cia has tried to highlight

5875150 one of the problems we have in this country right now is that its hard for people to understand an opposing point of view
5875151 and so therefore when republicans and democrats take a look at this bill i strongly urge them to not weaken the bill not to backslide not to say accountability isnt that important it is important well work with the school districts on flexibility when it comes to the accountability system but we will not allow this good piece of legislation to be weakened and if youre a parent you should insist that the no child left behind act remain a strong accountability tool so that every child in this country gets a good education

5875191 it was important that we did play the game no matter where it was we have everything set out and the players were looking forward to the two games
5875192 they have made a decision on that now and i think its important they have made that decision
5875193 at least we know we are playing that game and people are looking forward to that now
5875194 but no matter where the game was we would have gone and played it anywhere because it is important for the group and it is important to get the three points
5875195 believed to keep sinking all the way down to the bottom cutting deep crevasses and vertical tunnels that scientists call moulins
5875196 when the water reaches the bottom of the ice it lubricates the surface of the bedrock and destabilizes the ice mass
5875197 large pieces of ice to slide quickly into the ocean
5875198 could lead to a far more rapid disintegration of the ice sheets than predicted by any current models
5875199 present ice velocity measurements from the major ablation area along the western margin of the ice sheet
5875200 ice velocity reacts to increased meltwater production and increases by a factor of 4
5875201 over a longer period of 17 years annual ice velocities have decreased slightly
5875202 in earlier work lemke et al 2007 zwally et al 2002 it has been suggested that the interaction between meltwater production and ice velocity provides a positive feedback leading to a more rapid and stronger response of the ice sheet to climate warming than hitherto assumed
5875203 the englacial hydraulic system adjusts constantly to the variable meltwater input which results in a more or less constant ice flux over the years
5875204 may have only a limited effect on the response of the ice sheet to climate warming over the next decades

5875210 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
5875211 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
5875212 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
5875213 the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming

5875224 a police officer of seven years on medical leave labelled as a hero for being wounded in the line of duty got up in front of the world and told the world of how he and mr dyer uncovered this creature
5875225 on august 16 the freezer containing the alleged corpse arrived with the searching for bigfoot team
5875226 the ice was being thawed slowly without aid to prevent any decomposition of the alleged corpse we estimated that the freezer and its contents weighed over 1 500lbs and it would take several days or longer to thaw completely
5875227 the following day we were up early to discover that some hair was now exposed i extracted some from the alleged corpse examined it and had some concerns
5875228 we began an expedited melting process within one hour we were able to see the partially exposed head i was able to feel that it seemed mostly firm but unusually hollow in one small section this was yet another ominous sign
5875229 within the next hour of thaw a break appeared up near the feet area as the team and i began examining this area near the feet i observed the foot which looked unnatural reached in and confirmed it was a rubber foot
5875230 later that day we were informed that mr whitton and mr dyer had admitted it was a costume

5875233 at first they werent responsive but then they saw how it would benefit them
5875234 consumer opinion has a lot of power to influence companies
5875235 we continue to work within the supply chain to promote certification of forests and fibre and we are engaged with our suppliers to continuously improve on our prudent use of natural resources
5875236 sears has yet to make any policy changes so well continue to lobby them
5875237 its kinda cool bein in a band you cant pronounce

5875242 it is difficult to imagine a purer strain of religious intolerance than the fanaticism that pervades irans leadership class it is just as difficult to conjure a purer essence of tolerance than that which distinguishes
5875243 the purpose of justice is the appearance of unity among men happy is the manthat giveth ear unto it and observeth its precepts
5875244 see this touch its a kind of heaven for him
5875245 i sometimes wanted to play and my brother would be angry with me and tell me no i had to go back to work i just wanted some time to play or eat or rest but my brother began to hinder me and made me always work so i decided to run far away where i would not meet him again
5875246 like i have someone to stand beside me and if i ever need something they will help

5875254 ea pendejo ser lo que dios quiera que te est s volviendo viejo
5875255 por qu estoy en ocasiones callado o triste hay una causa humana de desgaste he sido pionero en una sociedad y en una compa a que por ejemplo en 1965 ni pensaba que pudiera llegar un medell n cuya realidad hac a ya a os que yo viv a e impulsaba cuando la dictadura militar en la argentina se me oblig a vivir en una casa solitaria con peligro de que cada noche me secuestraran y me asesinaran y esto por a o y medio padre todo esto se perdona pero deja una huella en la psicolog a y tambi n pienso que hay una causa espiritual comprendo que para la convivencia es un problema reconozco tambi n que soy tozudo y constante merecer a ser vasco como san ignacio concibo la vida en serio pero nunca he perdido de vista que lo relativo es relativo y estoy dispuesto siempre si me muestran razones a girar 180 grados en mis opiniones
5875256 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
5875257 how could they accuse of me of doing something wrong
5875258 if im not re elected our state will lose its influence
5875259 energy questions in the united states flow from the very fact that we have an energy policy in the first place
5875260 either the swimmers got it or they dont the suit will not win the race
5875261 when the shelling started the georgian troops would wait until the south ossetians would retreat to their basements as they have done for years during similar attacks and then the georgian army regulars would throw grenades into the basements of the houses or open fire on the civilians crowded inside their tiny basements
5875262 making up your mind questions to consider before the next election
5875263 heres what i want you to do between now and election
5875264 dont just look at issues look at character issues are important but you also have to look at character
5875265 theyre saying im totally self sufficient in myself and nobodys self sufficient enough to be president its too big a job
5875266 rick warren is at the forefront of a kind of younger generation of evangelical protestant leaders who want to have a christian public presence in the culture but who are less tied to the republican politics of their predecessors
5875267 theyre values oriented guys but less convinced that either their own principles or the best politics lies in a total commitment to the republican party
5875268 we are one of those people that make over 250 000 a year and i dont agree that that makes us rich
5875269 even with that kind of income we struggle to pay everything we have gotten ourselves into
5875270 im pretty much a dyed in the wool republican and i was a marine what he went through for five years you gotta hand that to him
5875271 i mean come on whoever buys into that they gotta have a screw loose
5875272 just stay in the senate stay busy learn more foreign policy and come back in ten years obama and i betcha id vote for you
5875273 hes as genuine as can be its just hes a green apple hanging on the tree and mccain is a ripe red apple ready to be picked obama just needs to ripen some more
5875274 barack obama is going to get the same percentage of the religious vote that john kerry and al gore got
5875275 thats christian identity politics and im sure it has some influence but i dont think at the end of the day its the deciding factor
5875276 jimmy carter could have come in here and sounded much more comfortable with his faith but people having seen a jimmy carter presidency would not vote for him just because theyre likely to see him in heaven
5875277 study all the different candidates at every different level you need to register to vote and then you need to vote
5875278 when i hear people say i dont like either of the candidates im just not going to vote i want to say to them well then you need to move to another country because people died for that vote
5875279 manawatu have not had a challenge since 1991 so we just want to go out and enjoy the moment well certainly have a crack
5875280 we started poorly against waikato and gave away too many easy points which put us under pressure
5875281 we showed a lot of character coming back for the draw but we cant afford a similar start against auckland
5875282 but theres a lot of belief within the squad after beating canterbury we know if we front we can be competitive but weve got to front up for 80 minutes
5875283 will be in a significantly stronger financial position and will have the resources to develop a strong international in market presence
5875284 the vast majority of these fall to silver fern farms or directly to supplier shareholders the report said
5875285 grant samuel believes a positive outcome of the proposed transaction is that the interests of pggw and silver fern farms will be closely aligned
5875286 the proposed transaction will increase silver fern farms equity to in excess of 500 million and transform silver fern farms from being an undercapitalised company with limited scope to undertake new capital projects or pursue acquisitions to the financially strongest company in the new zealand meat processing industry
5875287 you got a guy coming up there who cant hit water if he fell out of a boat
5875288 ive been a rangers fan all my life and i can tell you theres been plenty of fucking crying in baseball
5875289 you got a guy coming up there who cant hit water if he fell out of a boat
5875290 ive been a rangers fan all my life and i can tell you theres been plenty of fucking crying in baseball
5875291 well no but you have to ask yourself what it means
5875292 president elect mccain will be making a very big mistake by appointing joe leiberman as his vp
5875293 you ever notice how anyone who stands between them and power is an evil idiot bent on the destruction of the world funny how that works
5875294 actually the far right often accuses chavez not only of wanting to take over south america but often insinuate that hes working with iran to install nukes the far right often accuses syria of attacking us interests granted considering israel is our 51st state thats not unexpected as for mugabe the far right has been rather silent i guess its more important to pretend that were all georgians than to take an actual stand on mugabes horrific abuses
5875295 the presumptive democratic presidential nominee will announce his running mate
5875296 serene self confidence even arrogance would likely add a necessary dash of bareknuckle candor to obamas high road bid
5875297 by selecting the pro choice ridge as his running mate mccain would a appeal to moderate swing voters b extend an olive branch to pro choice former clintonistas dissatisfied with obama c reinforce his perceived edge over the democratic nominee in the experience and foreign policy departments and d have a shot at competing in pennsylvania
5875298 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
5875299 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
5875300 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
5875301 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
5875302 has a habit of straying off message and making impolitic comments
5875303 pretty deep knowledge of pretty much every big foreign policy question
5875304 obama has shown himself more not less in need of an attack dog able to engage mccain on national security
5875305 e vents in georgia and pakistan have made the prospect that obama will choose
5875306 if obama wanted to make a truly big statement before the convention he might want to risk alienating democrats by picking a republican running mate
5875307 than by choosing a member of the other to be his running mate
5875308 fill the bill of the excitement of the newcomer on the national stage
5875309 p ick a running mate who is a conservative white guy or a general or a republican
5875310 obama is likely to choose someone relatively safe and avoid taking a chance with a game changing selection
5875311 someone who would fill perceived holes in his r sum
5875312 who would reinforce his promise of change or one who might help him win a contested state
5875313 den arena vi har i dag r inte optimal f r stora arrangemang
5875314 the flame of the fire of love in this world of earth and water comes through the power of attraction and not by effort and striving
5875315 it is natural for the heart and spirit to take pleasure and enjoyment in all things that show forth symmetry harmony and perfection
5875316 a good character is verily the best mantle for men from god with it he adorneth the temples of his loved ones by my life the light of a good character surpasseth the light of the sun and the radiance thereof whoso attaineth unto it is accounted as a jewel among men the glory and the upliftment of the world must needs depend upon it a goodly character is a means whereby men are guided to the straight path and are led to the great announcement well is it with him who is adorned with the saintly attributes and character of the concourse on high
5875317 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5875318 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5875319 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5875320 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5875321 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
5875322 its quite good for me knowing that mikes going to be fresh
5875323 me and mike are able to focus on one event rather than ben having to back up and do another one
5875324 in that regard were able to focus on that event on one day and put all our eggs into that one basket
5875325 i was within half a second of those guys and i believe ive gone faster since poland so im right there with the top guys in the world
5875326 having adam take off i tied up a little bit i didnt relax enough i used too much arm
5875327 i still came home pretty strong to only be a second off my best and feel so so im pretty happy with it
5875328 i just wanted to get a gauge of where i was at i was pretty nervous but i always get nervous before i race
5875329 with 60 metres to go i thought the medal was mine then with 20 metres to go i saw him on the big screen and dug deep at the end the power came not from my legs but from my soul
5875330 over the first one and a half laps i got the easiest route of anyone i was fairly relaxed in fact at the bell i was surprised i felt strong enough to have two laps left in me
5875331 but at the end i was absolutely stuffed i collapsed on the track it was much more humid tonight and i was gasping for air
5875332 it is absolutely regrettable that the leader of fiji has decided not to attend this forum
5875333 we in the south pacific and island countries in particular take democracy seriously
5875334 i assumed you know since the state was fair in how they did it that the state just deducted a half hour a day from these peoples pay paid them a half hour less well i didnt find out until later that they were getting paid the same thing we were
5875335 theres no way to do that because it would be so dependent on the nature of the employees work whether they were a short term employee that only worked for the state for 6 to 12 months or if they literally spent their entire career at the state so theres no way to arrive at that
5875336 they just picked it up and walked out with the whole box
5875337 they were giving us the impression they were here to pray
5875338 to bring a little child into that and start them off at that age thats no example to be given to their children
5875339 this is going to be unique for this section of the shoreline
5875340 its going to provide a recreational facility for young people and older people and its going to be a breakthrough
5875341 a teen center is a place for folks to go so the state is really pleased to be a partner in this whole process
5875342 trying so hard to be perfect that it is stultifying
5875343 if obama gets elected and there is nothing funny about him it wont be the economy thats depressed it will be the rest of us
5875344 not only are we waging two illegal and immoral wars in afghanistan and iraq but theyre planning on attacking another country iran and we will not let them do that
5875345 the oil companies need to know that there is a limit on how much profit they can take in this economy
5875346 for a young man so apt at playing president barack obama badly misjudged the important demands of the office he seeks
5875347 visits with world leaders and speeches to cheering europeans shouldnt be a substitute for comforting injured american heroes
5875348 was to have injured soldiers get pulled into the back and forth of a political campaign
5875349 if i had been told by the pentagon that i couldnt visit those troops and i was there and wanted to be there i guarantee you there would have been a seismic event
5875350 theres higher growth happening in brazil russia india and china than happening in western countries and so thats an area of focus for us
5875351 we invest in these technologies to be a leader in those markets
5875352 now covering over 240 countries worldwide for address cleansing twice what we had before
5875353 when you have teams in different countries they can work in their native language
5875354 today with increasing globalization data entering the data stream is internationalized
5875355 theres more than western english and thats why we see an uptick of interest in doing what we call matching cross script
5875356 there are regulatory requirements that everyone who wants to conduct business knows who theyre doing business with so they arent dealing with suspected criminals or terrorists
5875357 often you dont have their full name just an address or description
5875358 the volume of data weve seen over the past decade has grown exponentially and some of our biggest customers have been the big data aggregators the credit bureaus the data providers
5875359 all three highly rated as having some of the best mdm solutions available
5875360 sen barack obama held a private session with a group of about two dozen iranian american donors shortly before a fundraiser this month in california after one of the participants said the obama campaign would hold such a forum if local iranian americans were able to raise 250 000
5875361 the meeting took place one room removed from where the main obama victory fund fundraiser was scheduled inside the balboa bay club
5875362 we deny in the strongest possible terms the suggestion that bahais in iran have engaged in any subversive activity
5875363 the bahai community is not involved in political affairs their only crime is the practice of their religion
5875364 the bahais have nothing tohide and try to answer truthfully whenever they are interrogated
5875365 oh heres a quarter that makes 80 more cents and i know i have some more change in my pocket just a sec
5875366 i guess after hitting two dead end streets and refusing to take the underpass at that traffic circle and then there was that one detour where you made three lefts in a row and oh yeah the last pass around the block while i tried to tell you to just let me out which cost me an extra 1 25 well silly me i somehow got the impression that you have nothing but time to waste
5875367 kristen and i ran into each other and we did discuss a veronica movie
5875368 fans still ask me all the time if the shows coming back emotionally i dont want to think about veronica mars every day because it really does make me sad
5875369 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
5875370 oh my gosh the ice caps are melting and were all gonna die before lunch
5875371 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative
5875372 which is as textbook a case of the pot calling the kettle black as has ever been recorded
5875373 gore is the person who in the congress most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an internet
5875374 has played a powerful role in policy terms that has supported its continued growth and application for which we should be thankful
5875375 how honest are we if we tell the truth most of the time amp
5875376 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
5875377 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
5875378 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
5875379 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
5875380 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
5875381 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
5875382 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
5875383 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
5875384 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
5875385 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
5875386 waters been nice the weathers been great its not too hot
5875387 the waters a lot cleaner than it was last year i took my boat in about six weeks early last year and this year weve been able to play up until at least now anyway
5875388 it has been a lot different weve seen a lot more rainfall lower temperatures and lower water consumption all of that is excellent for the systems and excellent for the reservoirs
5875389 the reservoirs are full all the underground aquifers are full so from a consumption standpoint we feel pretty good
5875390 its a pretty shocking number yes it is im not going to comment ok it is thats why were here to help these people
5875391 they said its a no flooding area a no flooding area thats why we didnt buy it
5875392 its really hard on family life especially for women with children under 6 they just cant be here they cant afford the rent in saratoga area so they stay back home with the kids and it splits the family up
5875393 talk on the phone yes how long maybe every two or three days
5875394 its kind of tough because you dont see him i miss him a lot sometimes
5875395 i recognized that that 25 year old man i dont think he really appreciated the life that he was taking that this was a human being
5875396 i feel now at 53 i have grown into a deeper understanding of what a human life is i have changed a lot
5875397 i would be something other than a nobody and that was my reasoning at the time
5875398 noyes has threatened to kill me and my family and will not rest until we are dead all the evidence you need is in his computer and that little girls mind please save her
5875399 extreme punishments such as locking her in a closet with no food for three days
5875400 its an opportunity for them to show that they know how to do it
5875401 in this regard a bad choice hurts much more than a good choice helps
5875402 i think a week from tomorrow we will all know
5875403 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
5875404 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
5875405 cooking with biofuels such as wood dung and crop residue
5875406 open biomass burning associated with deforestation and crop residue burning
5875407 soot and other forms of black carbon could have as much as 60 percent of the current our italics global warming effect of carbon dioxide
5875408 black carbon particles only remain airborne for weeks at most compared to carbon dioxide which remains in the atmosphere for more than a century
5875409 over 400 000 annual fatalities among women and children are attributed to smoke inhalation during indoor cooking
5875410 im just praying for the gwatney family its just beyond belief a horribly sad sad state of affairs
5875411 we are deeply saddened by the news that bill gwatney has passed away his leadership and commitment to arkansas and this country have always inspired us and those who had the opportunity to know him our prayers are with his family during this time
5875412 he was a long time friend of mine a caring compassionate individual with strong convictions who worked hard every day
5875413 its just senseless senseless he meant a lot to me and i talked to him and visited with him as late as thursday he was a visionary always looking forward a great guy i cant say enough about him he was a dear friend
5875414 honey you were in such good health i wouldnt have done it if youd been sick
5875415 there is no question there is a lot more excitement in our state for sen obama than there is for sen mccain r ariz
5875416 sen obama is seen as a huge breath of fresh air
5875417 well be focusing on the continuation of the last eight years and more of the same
5875418 i need to focus on my re election and he needs to focus on his campaign
5875419 i have one more point to make maybe two wait where are you going
5875420 theres only three things he mentions in a sentence a noun a verb and 9 11
5875421 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
5875422 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
5875423 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
5875424 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
5875425 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
5875426 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
5875427 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
5875428 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
5875429 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
5875430 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
5875431 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
5875432 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
5875433 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
5875434 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
5875435 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
5875436 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
5875437 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world

5875440 for me it is important to be captain but it is important what moment the players are in
5875441 he will not be sure to play the first eleven will be the best players for me not because they are the captain we have a vice captain rio ferdinand
5875442 sometimes in my career i spoke with the captain but usually i decide
5875443 i prefer that i decide everything always i speak with my staff and ask different questions but the last decision is mine
5875444 i think it is very important to know a lot of players as captains you have to know the players and then i choose from this not because someone told me this player is good but because i made the decision
5875445 i would have been really disappointed and im sure the players who didnt get it feel the same way
5875446 its been announced now and we can move forward i was standing next to rio and the first thing he did was shake my hand which is great and shows what kind of man and character he is
5875447 you hear little whispers and with the form that rio has been in and what man united have achieved i did think he would get it rio has been in great form for manchester united in the last couple of years what he has achieved has been an example we can all learn from that and its great that i beat players like that to the job
5875448 this is veep week that in reality is about all that anyone outside senator barack obamas inner inner circle knows
5875449 unless its al gore or john kerry or santa claus
5875450 it will never contribute more than a fraction of our needs
5875451 generates about 240 billion in annual revenues and employs a quarter million germans germanys wind industry created 8 000 jobs in 2007 alone and one recent study suggested that the renewable sector could provide more work than the auto industry currently the nations biggest employer by 2020
5875452 in the olympics we recognize that its possible for two competitors to both be perfect 10s a judge who feels that way can give both athletes the top score americans dont have that option in the voting booth even if you like two candidates you can vote for only one this is the root of the spoiler effect whenever two candidates base of support overlaps like al gore and ralph nader in 2000 voters who like both have to choose one and sometimes that prevents the most popular candidate from winning its happened at least five times in u s presidential elections one possible reform is to use a rating system much like that used in the olympics some have criticized scoring systems as complicated but people use them online all the time now rating videos and books on youtube and amazon both computer simulations and some real world trials have made a strong case that rating systems do the best job of reflecting voter sentiment
5875453 no matter when such election reforms are more widely enacted theres no good reason why pollsters shouldnt conduct some polls giving people greater choices right now
5875454 one can live in the shadow of an idea without grasping it
5875455 since she was killed more than 100 people have died at level crossings if people just ask us on this walk what its all about and we get a chance to say rail safety thats all were after if they can hear that its a good start
5875456 in this byelection you can tell harper how you really feel
5875457 it was quite clear in the minds of the community that the promoter picks up the whole cost
5875458 by addressing the connection between the health of our children and the health of the environment we strive to make a difference for both
5875459 to that end naturalpath media is the perfect partner for bringing relevant advertising and sponsorship support that aligns with our values and community at drgreene com

5875462 instead of focusing on positive free market solutions to energy challenges speaker of the house nancy pelosi and the democratic majority are pushing for the proven failed tax and regulatory policies of the past
5875463 and they are cheered on by global warming alarmists like al gore who want energy to be much more expensive so americans use less
5875464 educate citizens on the hot air in the energy and global warming debates
5875465 the oil and gas industry has launched a frenzied attack on these balanced common sense protections
5875466 i am here today to urge the cogcc to do what is best for all of colorado and tell an industry that routinely uses and spills dozens of toxic chemicals to stay at least 300 feet away from public drinking water sources
5875467 with tens of thousands of more wells on the way we need strong protections to ensure the oil and gas industry does not jeopardize our health and safety
5875468 the hard won gains of our troops hang in the balance
5875469 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines
5875470 whats less apparent is the judgment to be commander in chief
5875471 and in matters of national security good judgment will be at a premium in the term of the next president as we were all reminded 10 days ago by events in the nation of georgia
5875472 they did it to massachusetts sen john kerry they did it to former vice president al gore they tried to do it to former president clinton they did it to former massachusetts gov michael dukakis
5875473 thats what they do thats their politics they dont know how to govern they know how to run a negative campaign
5875474 in order for us to win we not only have to beat the attack machine weve got to win back the trust of the american people
5875475 the same guys that brought you george bush are now trying to bring you john mccain theyve basically got the same strategy which is they cant win an argument on ideas so what theyre going to do is theyre going to try to attack me
5875476 this may not be directly affiliated with the campaign but you know suddenly magically you got the same guy who wrote unfit for command
5875477 he comes out with a new book saying that im a nut
5875478 in the term of the next president skillful handling of such a crisis could be the difference between temporary hardship and far reaching disaster
5875479 unless you are in the top one tenth of 1 in this country you are not better off than you were four years ago or eight years ago
5875480 its because of that experience that when i hear that women are being treated unfairly in the workplace where theres injustice and were not seeing the basic principle of equal pay for equal work i get mad and i get frustrated
5875481 free us from our addiction to oil from 4 00 plus per gallon gas
5875482 there is no time to waste we want a better future we demand a better future we the american people are no longer asking
5875483 the free us ad takes a different tone than our previous efforts
5875484 this ad issues a direct and compelling challenge and juxtaposes the stark imagery of our addiction to fossil fuels with the earnest faces of the american people who are calling for answers and solutions now it takes the call for renewable energy from a request to a demand
5875485 the conventions are about coming together to choose the ideas and the people who will lead us forward
5875486 the next american president has the inescapable responsibility to move our country away from fossil fuels and toward clean sustainable energy sources our economic and environmental futures depend on it and the american people are demanding it
5875487 the irony is is probably the most unqualified man to seek the presidency since george w bush i mean think about it s only three things he mentions in a sentence a noun a verb and 9 11 theres nothing else and i mean this sincerely hes genuinely not qualified to be president
5875488 o friends of the pure and omnipotent god to be pure and holy in all things is an attribute of the consecrated soul and a necessary characteristic of the unenslaved mind the best of perfections is immaculacy and the freeing of oneself from every defect once the individual is in every respect cleansed and purified then will he become a focal centre reflecting the manifest light first in a human beings way of life must be purity then freshness cleanliness and independence of spirit first must the stream bed be cleansed then may the sweet river waters be led into it chaste eyes enjoy the beatific vision of the lord and know what this encounter meaneth a pure sense inhaleth the fragrances that blow from the rose gardens of his grace a burnished heart will mirror forth the comely face of truth
5875489 dont all children deserve an education no matter who they are
5875490 children are one of the most vulnerable groups in society and at the same time the most important they have no voice in the government they have no power of their own therefore every society has the responsibility to safeguard the well being of all children and the obligation to promote the full development of their physical mental and moral capacities to neglect this responsibility is to court the destruction of the foundations of society itself for the destiny of all future generations depends on the attention given to children now among the rights set forth in the convention one of the most important is often overlooked the right to moral education based on the principle of the oneness of humanity
5875491 this displacement is compounding the health problems in the region raising the risk of communicable diseases
5875492 why didnt you ever want to go out with me
5875493 you know i always figured that was the guys thing asking out the girl right
5875494 couldnt get a ticket it was a sold out show
5875495 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5875496 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5875497 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5875498 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5875499 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5875500 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5875501 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5875502 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5875503 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5875504 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5875505 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5875506 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5875507 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5875508 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5875509 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5875510 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5875511 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5875512 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5875513 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5875514 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
5875515 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5875516 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5875517 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5875518 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5875519 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5875520 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5875521 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5875522 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5875523 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5875524 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5875525 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
5875526 hey mister if you dont get those ads off the air in the next 48 hours then your military record and my military record are going to become a major issue in this campaign youve invited it and if you insist on permitting this stuff to continue then its going to be an issue
5875527 i know what im going into here for one thing im black ive got a feisty wife you know i mean we all know what theyre going to try to do here
5875528 look its just a continuation of what ive been doing a very positive approach that so far seems to have done what i hoped it would do and anyway thats the kind of guy i am so well just kind of continue
5875529 ive lost my benefits or i cant get them because my kids got a chronic heart problem or something
5875530 hey if you havent signed up as a precinct or block captain please do so the coordinators theyre ready for you give them your telephone and e mail address and so on and so forth well be in touch with you
5875531 well in the final maybe you did that in the primary dukakis but in the final its all its all this kind of stuff
5875532 get it off the air and i really mean it
5875533 i know what im walking into here i know there are some people who are going to try to take advantage of this but were going to take them on
5875534 well who is this guy anyway youre changing youre moving from here to there everywhere
5875535 hey those attacks that are coming from mccain heres the truth
5875536 look give me a summary of the kinds of things we want to say
5875537 i am married to the next president of the united states
5875538 run for governor ok what do i have to do
5875539 ayudantes tengo dos nada m s los otros no s qui nes son
5875540 flame amp citron ole christian madsen i love this danish director thats all i know
5875541 a midwestern professor whose life begins to unravel when his wife sets out to leave him and his socially inept brother kind wont move out of the house
5875542 flame amp citron ole christian madsen i love this danish director thats all i know
5875543 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
5875544 they told me there are going to be resources here
5875545 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
5875546 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
5875547 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
5875548 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
5875549 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
5875550 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
5875551 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
5875552 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
5875553 20 wind by 2030 increasing wind energy contribution to u s electric supply
5875554 would be accomplished solely through private investment with no new customer or corporate taxes or government regulation
5875555 in 1999 2001 and 2003 when congress temporarily killed the credits the number of new turbines dropped dramatically
5875556 tuesdays event illustrates the inherent challenges associated with using wind energy because the wind sometimes stops blowing without a moments notice engineers at ercot must remain nimble enough to respond to resulting instability on the grid
5875557 many asian brands were grown from copy cat economics using western benchmarks and paradigms most asian brands were driven by a 3 fold strategy copy that make them cheaply and make alot of it eventhough this may be fundamentally sustainable in the coming 20 to 30 years asian brands must transition from being centres of imitation to centres of creation to succeed otherwise there will be little economic sustainability in the long run
5875558 that means having the courage to step outside ones comfort zone and go against the grain
5875559 he said after the last eight years even our dogs and cats have learned that elections matter
5875560 it was so relevant to what we are doing here
5875561 we came up with something funny to fuse our interests in dogs and politics
5875562 we figured there were many dog afficionados who are also interested in politics
5875563 she was a stray but she worked her way up
5875564 well just be sending each other e mails at two in the morning instead of two in the afternoon
5875565 the alma awards is absolutely glamorous the latin stars really know how to dress up theyre not afraid of their sexuality and theyve got the perfect host in eva thats glamour
5875566 steve is our most experienced match official both internationally and domestically and has been referee of the year twice during his career
5875567 to ensure our national security economic prosperity and clean environment by breaking our dependence on foreign oil
5875568 the hands that install roofs can also install solar panels the hands that build todays cars can also build the next generation of fuel efficient vehicles barack obama will create 5 million jobs developing homegrown energy technologies
5875569 one of the most important ways of positioning on global warming is to emphasize the jobs issue since it appeals to people who you might not otherwise reach with your message
5875570 on the big issues that our nation faces some sacrifice will be required not only from you individually but from the nation as a whole there is no magic bullet to our energy problems for example no perfect energy source
5875571 the call to sacrifice for the nations greater good remains an imperative of citizenship sadly in recent years in the midst of a war on two fronts this call to service never came after 9 11 we were asked to shop
5875572 plenty of recent media polls demonstrate that drilling for more american oil particularly offshore drilling has the potential to be a very effective wedge issue for republicans as a way to reduce the price of gas
5875573 for the immediate short term right now forcing house democrats to vote on drilling offshore and in wilderness areas or exposing their refusal to hold this vote would be a potentially strong wedge issue that would split the democrats win among independents and excite the republicans
5875574 the republican echo chamber has done a great job on this
5875575 this intolerable dependence on foreign oil threatens our economic independence and the very future of our nation
5875576 the energy crisis is real it is worldwide it is a clear and present danger to our nation these are the facts and we must face them
5875577 thou shalt not talk honestly to the american people about sacrifice
5875578 and sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really upset you know into wallowing in self pity sometimes and i think its all part of the healing
5875579 the security council demands the immediate release of president sidi mohamed ould cheikh abdallahi and the restoration of the legitimate constitutional democratic institutions immediately
5875580 in particular its move to seize the powers of the presidency
5875581 became the hostage of a political entourage that diverted him from his supreme mission
5875582 cannot be described as a coup detat since all the institutions of the republic are working normally and basic freedoms are preserved
5875583 by 22 august a part of the peacekeepers will be pulled back to the temporary security zone
5875584 the remaining contingent that was used to reinforce the peacekeepers will be pulled back to the territory of south ossetia and to russia
5875585 this is one of the first units to be pulled out
5875586 the russians time and again move their tanks to tskhinvali the south ossetian capital from gori and then back again i categorically deny this amounts to a withdrawal
5875587 you can probably judge objectively for yourselves the state of georgian democracy and who is trying to wreck it

5875594 im absolutely thrilled i cant believe it i cant believe it
5875595 i bought that first bike from trinity church hall in edinburgh
5875596 hed be five and had just learned to ride much to my great shame it wasnt me who taught him he learned to ride the bike in the old quad of napier university in colinton road it took him an afternoon
5875597 it was good excitement im so proud its fantastic watching him and seeing that smile on his face it looks as if its sinking in a wee bit now im hugely proud and exceptionally happy for him
5875598 hes a terrific athlete to work with and also an inspiration for other younger athletes coming through
5875599 its just fantastic what hes done its absolutely mind blowing what hes achieved
5875600 its 15 20 years of absolute dedication leaving no stone unturned focusing on everything setting goals and chasing them all the time
5875601 it has been quite a niche sport but now its out there to be picked up by the public and i hope that this will inspire future athletes
5875602 he deserves it doesnt he hes the greatest olympian scotlands ever had
5875603 this was a stunning performance from chris hoy who had the whole of scotland on the edge of their seats
5875604 elmaaltshift com has launched a protest campaign against the latest internet banning of the sites such as youtube dailymotion and many others the campaign will last until the midnight of august 20
5875605 this is a preview of the future of the internet everyday another site is being banned we are curious what kind of internet we will have if the internet banning goes at this rate this is the simulation of the future
5875606 the access to this site is denied by its own decision
5875607 the access to this site is denied by a court order
5875608 the access to this site is denied by its own decision
5875609 we think the internet banning decisions by the telecommunication presidency and the turkish courts in the recent days have been at least partially arbitrary and excessive in order to call attention to the danger the freedom of communication is facing we will prevent the access to zargan voluntarily until the midnight of august 20
5875610 as the new academic year gets under way next week we will begin recruitment for spring 2009 programs and we are certainly hopeful that the rising value of the dollar will encourage more students to participate in programs in europe
5875611 the u s dollar had been in the gutter and now its just barely climbed back onto the sidewalk
5875612 it has a long way to go to make americans feel they can afford europe
5875613 oil prices have made airfares very expensive so getting to europe is still a big obstacle even if it is cheaper once one arrives
5875614 now the dollar does seem to be strengthening but i would think we have a lot of strengthening yet to come before this will negatively impact our position in the marketplace
5875615 for example a salary paid in euros or pounds if the dollar strengthens it means delta is not using so many dollars to pay employees
5875616 in its fight against terrorism france has just been struck severely
5875617 targeting u s and other nato forces and afghan forces have become larger and bolder and they include direct almost conventional style attacks
5875618 in late 2006 and into 2007 there was a much greater reluctance among the taliban and other groups to carry out these conventional style attacks
5875619 they clearly believe they are winning now and its caused them to be a bit more audacious
5875620 heartfelt thanks for the sacrifice that they are making and the commitment that the french are making to help secure afghanistan
5875621 its important to remember that we are all engaged in a serious effort to bring about a stable afghanistan
5875622 france will continue to assume its responsibilities in favor of a democratic and peaceful afghanistan and in the fight against terrorism
5875623 the doctor prescribed a pain killer and issued a certificate saying he is fit to travel
5875624 we need to control him and he will be controlled once he returns to this country
5875625 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world

5875631 the iraqis who have risen up against the occupation are not insurgents or terrorists or the enemy they are the revolution the minutemen and their numbers will grow and they will win
5875632 osama bin laden and these non nation state fighters with religious purpose are very similar to those kinds of atypical revolutionaries that helped to cast off the british crown
5875633 i made it to match because this will be a perfect beer girl costume the blouse is a blouse i already owned the only other company i have bought from that makes their own designs and makes clothing to order is this place called cameo intimates com
5875634 its called a raquel cami garter and i purchased it from trashy com trashy lingerie is based out of los angeles and their own seamstresses make these items as you order them they have the best lingerie as far as quality and originality anywhere that cami garter costs about 150 bucks and the matching thong costs about 40 its a little expensive for lingerie but this is not something that will ever fall apart because its so well made hey when you lounge around the house in sexy lingerie all day you need to buy stuff that will take a little wear and tear i wear a bra i bought from them in my video ultimate cherry brady interview its called the cameo sheer comfort bra in the color sunflower its a 36g and its very comfortable both companies should take pride because they are really putting out some quality products

5875642 by religion i do not mean formal religion or customary religion but that religion which underlies all religions which brings us face to face with our maker
5875643 religion which takes no account of practical affairs and does not help to solve them is no religion
5875644 that means religulous is probably playing in some out of the way theatre in the manhattan area also

5875650 the israelis have claimed for years that iranian uranium enrichment efforts are the first steps toward the development of a nuclear weapon a weapon they believe may be used on the jewish state
5875651 i wont accept it because i cant accept it because i dont what else ill do if this fails
5875652 i will fight tooth and nail against anyone who tries to make me accept it because i will be too lost if this doesnt happen
5875653 okay im not going to be president but how about vice president or something so i dont have to face having nothing
5875654 its all real its not a bad dream i am lost and dont feel like doing anything else everybody just leave me alone
5875655 okay i guess i dont have nothing i still have my family i still have people who believed in me i still have a job in the senate i can still make a difference
5875656 my core value and life has been to be of service my daddy did and so have i for most of my adult life i like being an educator on the problems of global warming but i may actually have more leverage to help that and other initiatives as president and besides i will agree if elected to only serve one term where one of my most important roles is to mentor barack obama to be the real president who makes change happen after i leave office in 2012
5875657 christopher doesnt see women for what they should be he sees women for who they can be

5875659 62 of all americans are part of a wireless mobile population that participates in digital activities away from home or work
5875660 gender stereotypes trump race stereotypes in every social science test
5875661 the deal is that women generally fall into two alternatives they are seen as either nice but stupid or smart but mean
5875662 contact doesnt undermine these stereotypes and it might even strengthen them
5875663 many people dont believe seeing women as kind or soft is a stereotype theyre not going to question it because they believe its a good thing

5875678 poker is a 300 year old profession its an avocation its not gambling eight people play and theres a prize pool
5875679 if you just throw out the signatures on the basis that they only contain post office boxes whats going to happen is theres a lot of people that is going to be disenfranchised through the election process
5875680 in light of the statutory purpose of determining whether signers are qualified electors we find it difficult to see how a post office box address renders a signature invalid per se if an elections official can verify that the signer is a qualified elector
5875681 in some instances the election official may even have the post office box address on file
5875682 legislative clarification of the statutory requirements for signatures on candidate nominating petitions would be helpful to both candidates and election officials

5875691 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
5875692 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
5875693 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
5875694 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
5875695 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
5875696 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology

5875741 the result is desynchronisation if birds and the insects upon which they depend do not react in the same way we are headed for an upheaval in the interaction between species
5875742 the response is faster than we thought but it is still not fast enough to keep up with climate change
5875743 is most likely changing at its maximal possible rate which is insufficient to catch up to climate change
5875744 this discrepancy may have profound consequences on the ability of species to cope with climate change in the long run

5875751 whoever believes in him is not condemned but whoever does not believe is condemned already because he has not believed in the name of the only son of god
5875752 now the dwelling of god is with men and he will live with them they will be his people and god himself will be with them and be their god he will wipe every tear from their eyes there will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain for the old order of things has passed away

5875834 weve went to a lot more whole wheat breads and just trying to make a more well rounded meal
5875835 we did we did raise our hot lunch prices this year and our breakfast prices both and basically its tied into the transportation costs and so forth
5875836 our hot lunch program has a lot more vegetables and fresh fruits and those type of things in it and those things are a little bit more spendy
5875837 i like the fresh fruit its good to not have it in a can
5875838 its kinda that good kinda feeling for those kids to know that theyre getting something nutritious and its also reassuring to parents

5875849 weve had a significant number of them come back there are some that did not make it but thats a personal preference on their part and it was a choice they had to make whether they felt they could continue because of the different ways they had to refinance

5875851 we are delighted to today announce that one of the greats of australian football is a central coast mariner
5875852 since joining us as a triallist mark has proven to be an exceptional role model for not only the younger members of our playing group but also our senior players and i have every confidence that by mark continuing his stay with us in the capacity of a guest player we have significantly boosted our aspirations on and off the pitch for the current season
5875853 we as a club have been simply amazed by the work ethic mark has showcased since joining our playing group and cannot speak highly enough of the overwhelmingly positive effect his presence has had on our squad and our club
5875854 it has been a feature of our recruitment history to repatriate australias finest football exports and with mark on board we have continued this tradition and very happily and willingly provided a well deserved opportunity for one of the greats of the australian game to contribute to this most exciting time for football in this country
5875855 when we had the ball i thought we played very well
5875856 defensively we gave some chances away i was not so pleased with that but thats normal we had one day s preparation
5875857 overall i was very pleased with the performance the boys looked fresh and sharp
5875858 by adopting such a pro imperialist policy the congress will not be able to counter the bjp and the communal forces

5875863 you could put it on a turntable and figure it out
5875864 i can take the looks im getting in the hall but its time for us to make some real change up here lets not say were going to run reform measures and not do it
5875865 mr mustio and i are friends but obviously i couldnt disagree with him more
5875866 i just think this is an overboard reform to fix the problems
5875867 its a difficult issue for an employer to look at eliminating their own jobs
5875868 of that number of people who switched into the democratic party were not seeing large numbers going back to a previous party which we thought we might see and which mightve increased our workload
5875869 it is my hope that fidelity will follow the industry trendand promptly repurchase these securities that it has sold toits customers many of whom now find themselves unable toaccess money that they thought was as liquid as cash
5875870 i would even go further to say the worst is to come
5875871 we have not yet entered the tightest credit markets of this downturn
5875872 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
5875873 acting is definitely harder for women women kind of wilt as men sort of achieve as they get older like wine or whatever its like oh shes past her prime and she cant play a sex symbol its just a preconceived notion about women in general and particularly in this industry its a very vain vain industry
5875874 they were brokering relationships with complete strangers to fool the credit scoring system that this was a genuine relationship
5875875 that is a very bad thing not to have a credit score
5875876 the population really looks at us as handing out birth control pills and i cant deny that its a part of working with teens but the clinics are much more comprehensive than that
5875877 these days there are fewer and fewer clinics for the underserved to go to
5875878 we also do a lot of in school outreach to parents and families trying to hook them up with insurance maybe a parent isnt eligible for insurance because of a chronic illness but their kids might be
5875879 there will be a conversation over the next few weeks
5875880 insurance doesnt work as a source of funding because our clinics focus mostly on prevention
5875881 what youre seeing is not only this spring when you saw a lot of democrats jump on for the primary but people staying on past the primary
5875882 this is a massive shift among pennsylvania voters to the democratic party and away from the republican party
5875883 i think a lot of this is driven from the top down
5875884 part and parcel with bush was if the party moved to the right on social issues and obviously had a role in moving the u s into the war in iraq those issues didnt resonate with pennsylvania voters
5875885 i dont think youre seeing a large shift in ideology among pennsylvanians but the perception that the republican party has shifted to one side and out of favor
5875886 down the ticket it will have a bigger effect in terms of congressional elections the seats in western pennsylvania could go democratic
5875887 i think pennsylvania is a place that will remain in play these voters whove switched have shown a preference for not being aligned with one party completely
5875888 we conducted a scientific poll in april and we asked people what they were doing with their registration and asked if they changed their registration in the past calendar year and most voters who changed their registration did so to vote for senator obama
5875889 about 10 percent of the registered democrats had just registered or switched
5875890 when we asked people who they were going to vote for among switchers they overwhelmingly supported obama
5875891 if the republicans cant figure out a way to win back the loss of their own party faithful in the philadelphia suburbs pennsylvania could switch from being a slightly blue state
5875892 at the moment the long range trends favor the democrats that doesnt mean we wont be a competitive two party state for a number of years yet
5875893 absolute disdain for the bush administration and an overwhelming desire for change folks really wanted to vote in the democratic primary for a democratic candidate and werent interested in what the republicans were offering
5875894 i think that folks are really fed up with the way the country has gone in the past few years
5875895 lets be honest and real about this people get excited about the presidential candidates
5875896 top of the ticket certainly helps with turnout the level of enthusiasm the number of volunteers the amount of campaign activity is at the highest level in years
5875897 it is a natural inclination for voters to want to participate in a big election such as the democratic gubernatorial primary in 2002 and the democratic presidential primary this year
5875898 in each of those cases republican voters did not have a significant choice to make at the time of the primary making a decision to change registration much easier
5875899 over the past several decades party labels have become less important to voters who are choosing which candidates they support based on a much broader array of criteria
5875900 voters today are more willing than ever to split their ticket voting for republicans in some races and democrats in other races i believe they will cast their votes after reviewing each candidates platform experience and integrity
5875901 of that number of people who switched into the democratic party were not seeing large numbers going back to a previous party which we thought we might see and which mightve increased our workload

5875908 the basic rule is that in a court case whether it isbankruptcy or another case we dont want people always runningoff to the appellate court
5875909 in order to appeal typically the law requires there be afinal order or a final judgment in the case

5875918 i just wanted to do a little sailing ive been a sailor a long time
5875919 i surfaced and i was looking around for my boat and the motor was running and the sail was up and there was the boat going off to the southeast
5875920 and i thought ah man not gonna be a good day
5875921 id swim a little bit and then id rest id do a dead mans float you know where you lay on your back and just let your limbs but obviously thats not a very good way to make progress towards land
5875922 i was getting the waves over my legs and they were crashing down on my chest and then the water coming up to my face so i mustve swallowed 50 gallons of bay water yuck
5875923 it was flashing the green light and i knew that if i could make it that far even though the rescuers may have given up i could hang on to it and wait for first light because i know they would get back out
5875924 i stopped and i looked and here the helicopter was coming back towards me real slow so i started treading water to keep my head above water and im waving my arms frantically and the pilot turned his light on and flicked it a couple of times to let me know that he saw me
5875925 i will probably never feel anything like that in my life it was just such a relief and knowing that they werent going to find me in another type of condition because that probably was a very real thing
5875926 two rules that will be in effect from now on is number one wear a life jacket number two never sail alone
5875927 the comfort level is something you work on i learned that last year that it comes the more you play and i still have it with cliffy and tausch but it will get better as the season goes along

5875956 the race in iowa while relatively close appears to be moving in obamas direction
5875957 most importantly for obama his supporters are much more likely to say they strongly support him which makes them much more likely to turn out on election day and much more likely to talk to friends and neighbors volunteer in the campaign and do the kinds of things that win elections typically those who are less supportive are also less motivated to vote no matter how much they say ahead of time that theyll turn out to vote
5875958 while both candidates have secured their party bases the battle over independents continues in iowa
5875959 while independents are leaning more toward mccain at this time the substantial lead in democratic registration over republican in iowa means obama does not have to win independents to win iowa as long as he is winning 90 percent or more of democrats he does however have to keep things close
5875960 confidence in your candidate is another motivator to actually get out and vote
5875961 when you believe you will win its all the more reason to show up at the polls when you think you will lose its easier to not bother so again obama voters appear likely to be more motivated in november
5875962 barack obama is a black man will make it more difficult for friends and neighbors to vote for him
5875963 theres a substantial minority of voters concerned about the effects of race on the election
5875964 we cant directly ask voters if they are unwilling to vote for someone because of race but we can ask what they think others will do the fact that obama voters are much more concerned than mccain voters shows there is a fear among those who support obama that others will be less likely to support him because of his race mccain voters can safely say its not a worry because if its an issue their candidate will benefit
5875965 while many of those who express belief that race will make an obama vote more difficult think it will only be a little more difficult for their friends and neighbors to vote for him nearly a quarter of iowa voters see obamas race as a more significant stumbling block
5875966 of course we dont completely know their thoughts obama supporters are probably worried that their candidate will be hurt by his race and are projecting that worry on others
5875967 while many mccain supporters may agree it will be difficult for obama they would prefer to see their candidate win so if race does hurt obama its not as much a concern to them personally it seems clear though that race is a factor even if its hard to quantify
5875968 perceptions of obamas religion may turn out to be equally or more important than his race in the 2008 election especially among those who perceive him to be a muslim
5875969 iowa voters are similar to those in other states in terms of their likelihood of believing obama is muslim while mccain supporters are more likely to believe this we cannot necessarily draw the conclusion that they support mccain because of this belief mccain supporters may simply have no reason to learn obamas religion at the same time its certainly possible some of these voters support mccain because of their belief that obama is muslim
5875970 its very clear that voters who continue to support george bush will vote for john mccain
5875971 not only is this a simple continuation of partisan support but mccain is clearly associated with supporting much of the bush agenda and voters recognize the connection
5875972 the challenge for obama lies with independents who disapprove of bush while mccain has the support of more than 8 in 10 bush supporters obama is only picking up 6 in 10 of those who disapprove of bush this gap is allowing mccain to claim a plurality of all independent voters at this time
5875973 similar to a large car or larger ship the ride is just more stable and more enjoyable especially for trans con flights

5875986 diese parkordnung entspricht einem beschluss aus dem jahre 2000 der im zusammenhang mit dem ausbau der neustra e und einer einhergehenden neuregelung des verkehrs getroffen wurde

5875988 nat rlich nicht aus dass sich in zukunft auch neue perspektiven ergeben k nnen
5875989 der derzeitige ausbauzustand wird von der verwaltung als sachgerechte l sung angesehen insoweit wird ein bedarf f r anderweitige l sungen nicht gesehen
5875990 i think the department itself really has to recognize where its coming from and that will help us solve who its coming from
5875991 it was a design there was a picture down there you can see a little hearts i dont know what it said
5875992 you can see some of it refers to the insane clown posse you can see some of it probably refers to the juggalos
5875993 one of the things we always have to look at is we dont have anything against someones belief system but where the problem lies is when they cross the line from being just a belief system to when theyre starting to commit crimes
5875994 why wait theres no im 52 now and im not getting any younger so lets get going
5875995 we have heard a lot about preparation what do i have to do to get prepared
5875996 we have a lot of resources here to help them with that process
5875997 with the taxes and all that nobody can afford it
5875998 nobody has the money to buy anything any more i mean the gas prices and everything are going up so its just too hard for anyone to afford it i mean i love that school i went to that school i loved it so its just hard
5875999 i believe the school is the backbone of the community and its very important to have a school and anyone whos interested in moving up here obviously looks at the school system and if you dont have one its sad for the whole community
5876000 pump prices that were in the 3 range to the last one that was about 4 37 a gallon
5876001 if it says 65 we cant go faster than that we really watch the speed zones because you cant accelerate fast you got to go slow you try to keep four seconds behind who we are traveling behind
5876002 we do all the tricks we can to make them run as efficiently as we can but still theres going to be issues out there
5876003 you are going to have some retirements or people leave to do something else and well be much more cautious about replacing those positions given the fact were going to have this additional fixed cost with fuel
5876004 and hopefully its going to be an intellectual one and hopefully it gives the voters an opportunity to see the clear differences that exist
5876005 were going to talk about issues were going to talk about things that impact people in everyday life
5876006 i think theres just honest difference of opinion and i think thats all it has to be about
5876007 an important next step in the journey to ensuring the nations energy security

5876027 i researched every game on microfilm at the detroit public library at least the ones i couldnt find on line which was most of them
5876028 there are only three libraries in the state with the papers on film going back to 1901 so i was lucky enough to live near one of them
5876029 i didnt do anything with it right away i just thought it was one of the most original ideas id ever heard
5876030 he gave me the idea to put the box scores in there he also told me not to focus much on doing play by play but instead tell why each game is significant a friend of mine at work actually knows dan dickerson the tigers radio play by play announcer i interviewed him and he put me in touch with ernie which was a huge help to give the book credibility
5876031 one of my biggest pet peeves are the sports lists on cable sports stations which countdown the greatest moments in history and theyre all in the last 30 years as if there is no sports history prior to 1975
5876032 i wanted to get an accurate representation of the entire 107 year history of the franchise and feature all of its greatest players
5876033 to leave out some outstanding games i left out the one where jim northrup hit two grand slams in a game in 1968 because it conflicted with i think mark fidrych on monday night baseball against the yankees a game i absolutely had to have in the book
5876034 it was sort of 50 50 on what to do about the box scores
5876035 i went with using the originals i think that even though theyre hard to read it makes it more authentic people love their sports memorabilia like old programs and baseball cards i figured id be better off with the original indisputable record of the box score it gives it more of a classic feel
5876036 the tigers have never swept a world series in franchise history therefore ending on a game four would make it feel incomplete the game four i chose is from 1909 a game which tied up the series if my memory is correct at two games apiece in a series they eventually lost game seven of the 1968 world series is one of the greatest moments in detroit sports history the tigers after trailing three games to one came back to beat the cardinals and their hall of fame ace bob gibson ending a book with a championship only made sense to me the only reason the previous rounds didnt go further is simple the tigers have never won a game 5 7 in the alcs or a game five in the alds for that matter since i was able to find great games 1 7 of the world series i went with that
5876037 here are some additional simple things that i will recommend like proper tire pressure or avoiding rapid starts and stops
5876038 if we stopped the renovation of the stadium right now wed pay off the bonds very very quickly

5876044 because thats our function in your life my function in your life is to call you forth your function in my life is to call me forth that is what men and women are here to do for each other
5876045 a mans greatest psychic need is to have his thoughts respected and a womans greatest psychic need is to have her feelings cherished
5876046 if you stand forth with a woman and your intention is to seek to call her forth by being a space in which she feels comfortable then youre going to see such beauty in a woman
5876047 were not having dates were having auditions asking are you good enough
5876048 he loved women and he saw the beauty in every woman and so his very being said to a woman come on be beautiful for me
5876049 we are all telepathically communicating with each other all the time
5876050 the truth is unless you love them you cant understand them the reason you dont understand women is youre not loving them enough yet
5876051 your function as a male is to love every one of them if you stand in front of a woman and your thought i invite you to show me how beautiful she is then in your presence she will
5876052 the issue is not how to understand a woman its how to love a woman

5876067 the kind of philosophical pharisaism that has thoroughly infected evangelical theology prostituting the gospel for the sake of what is a spurious modernist epistemology or philosophical theory of knowledge to begin with is probably more responsible for the spread of relativism which has been snowballing for the last half century in the western world than any subtle seepage of pomo premises into the cultural and intellectual mainstream

5876089 i was desperately needing to meet up with somebody who could give me a re supply of water and no other vessel had been near enough
5876090 it was so good to have the water the weather is so hot and humid now that they might quite literally have saved my life
5876091 it was extremely exciting to see another human being in the middle of the ocean
5876092 we were missing seeing another face so that was wonderful
5876093 she needed water and we needed food it was a feeling of reciprocal altruism that is very basic to human nature this experience was one of the highlights of my life
5876094 the most ubiquitous trash out here is plastic and the most common i would say are fragments of plastic bags and water bottles

5876098 id say both in the beginning i was stressed out but i was having fun i was goin through challenges ya know when you do methamphetamine it messes with your emotions and mind and stuff partying for that many years its like a kid goin to the candy store every day sooner or later hes gonna end up sick and unhealthy ya know after time passes you start to become more normal again but i had a lot of fits or rage i would break things in the studio if things didnt go my way so that had to go but the times when things were goin really good were fun while i was going through those challenges i could take time off i would take like even six months off ya know in 2006 i hadnt done music for a while and just wanted to take a break it was cool to do that because there was no pressure there was no one tellin me dude you gotta get into the studio and finish this weve got a deadline there was no deadline it was just whatever happened ya know everything happened the way it was supposed to because im a new man now im totally calm when things dont do my way i dont freak out im just a new person and it feels great
5876099 the shit he did thats what got me into heavy music vulgar display of power i was only into eighties music before that the heaviest thing i listened to was skinny puppy and ministry but that wasnt metal when i heard vulgar display i was like holy shit what the fuck is this the first time i ever saw them live before korn was even signed me and fieldy korn bassist went and it was pantera and sepultura at irving meadows in l a they came out started the first song the curtain dropped and me and fieldy just started crying we looked at each other and we had tears in our eyes because it was so fucking intense and heavy and sick
5876100 the situation in the region and saudi arabias political and financial support for the palestinian authority
5876101 right now there are russian soldiers and tanks at poti
5876102 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances
5876103 it didnt take them really three or four days to get into georgia and it really shouldnt take them three or four days to get out
5876104 it was a murder with intention he murdered her in anger because she refused to part with the gadget
5876105 we were always worried about students bringing such gadgets to the school
5876106 we have issued several notices and given enough warnings asking them not to bring ipods and cell phones to class
5876107 what does that mean find your path is there more than one
5876108 its only money itll only hurt for a little while
5876109 although these are merely illusory phenomena and not to be given much consideration they are auspicious blessings from another dimension and a very good sign
5876110 we are so glad to be back home this has been the trip of a lifetime and is a remarkable achievement for all of us we had some challenging situations especially in russia and the planning and coordination at each control point was key to our success
5876111 the support we received from agustawestland around the world was unprecedented and their employees went above and beyond the call of duty to make sure every detail was taken care of we pushed the aircraft to its limit and this trip is a true testament to the grands superior performance
5876112 congratulations to scott kasprowicz steve sheik and the support team from everyone at agustawestland for setting an outstanding new around the world flight record we have watched with amazement the progress of n1us around the globe and we are delighted that the agustawestland grand performed as well as the crew averaging around 2 000 miles per day is an incredible feat i am sure this is a record which will stand for many years

5876116 mothers against drunk driving is not against drinking were against drinking and driving
5876117 they wrote the law for a reason as i said youre not fully developed at age 18 so you really need to think about when youre in college they have so much peer pressure anyway so i think at 21 they can distinguish between right and wrong
5876118 allow 18 year olds thats too young too young for them to be able to be allowed to drink
5876119 i think it should be based on maturity level and not the age of the person
5876120 i have grandkids and i dont want my grandkids to go to college to think that its okay for them to go to college at 17 and 18 and drink cause its not

5876186 we loved the grand champions sauce from last years competition so much we are featuring it on the t g i fridays menu
5876187 while our guests can experience the sauce from the worlds greatest barbecue competition now at t g i fridays one grand prize winner and a guest will experience the 20th anniversary event in person this october
5876188 weve got to protect the football and really just take our shots when we can get them
5876189 we think we can control the tempo with our back its not that wide open go get em kind of thing which is a risky offense
5876190 got great command of the offense he runs and also of the players because they know that if they pay close attention and do what he says theyll be productive and make plays
5876191 if that wasnt the case i wouldnt be here in san francisco
5876192 if i got 360 000 after tax i would probably buy a bright pink ferrari and waste it all like a stupid premiership footballer but im gutted that the game is off i love playing up here and i love twenty20 my family is from the north east so im gutted for them too even gran although she cant see too far out on to the pitch maybe i just wont tell her the game is off
5876193 i suppose they will have to go back to the last twenty20 game i cant remember who did well there but i think i got two for 15
5876194 we have to focus on the one day series you cant think about a one off twenty20 in a few months time it is kevin pietersens first one day series as captain and everyone wants to make a good impression after the way the new zealand series finished
5876195 i was desperate to play for england and when the no6 role was up for grabs i was happy to try to make that place my own
5876196 but i have batted at three for eight years now at middlesex so i know exactly what is required in that role i feel i can do a very good job at three if given that run it is nice that the captain has backed me to deliver in a key position in the batting order
5876197 i dont know if im the best batsman in the team
5876198 i think that no4 is the best batsman in our team but that is probably something that i can strive for i can look at kevin pietersen and challenge myself if i do get a run and establish myself i will be setting myself the same standards that kevin sets and who knows maybe one day i will be the best batter in the team time will tell when you go in at six the field is out and the ball is doing a bit less at three you get more value for your shots if you pierce the field if you do get in you score quicker compared to batting at six i have done that to a degree for middlesex in the past i want to play the same role for england
5876199 i have scored quite a few runs in the first class game in the past few years but when michael vaughan stepped down as captain my timing wasnt great as i hadnt scored that many runs in the four day game
5876200 i think it all depends how the next six months go for the england test team
5876201 there was a lot of talk after gavin departed but the team never felt down
5876202 we stuck together and this is a great success not only for beijing but for london with so many of these guys intending to stay around for 2012
5876203 in the last fight against eleider alvarez won on a countback i was nervous and tense
5876204 hopefully my funding will increase now for the 2012 olympics
5876205 jeffries said to me after the fight that i was a lot better than he thought i was which was cheeky thing to say
5876206 its ambitious and the last four days have taken too much out of brad he couldnt generate the leg speed with the efforts he had made since day one and he couldnt jump as he did at manchester if you look at the guys who got up there today for many of them it was their only event of the games mentally and physically this is a very tough event to win
5876207 the reaction of the american left to john edwardss sex scandal is nothing short of flabbergasting since when is sex outside of marriage a disqualifier for merely speaking at a political convention since when is having sexual relations with that woman in your office anything wrong since when do we judge the difference here seems to be that elizabeth edwards has cancer so only fatal disease makes the bonds of marriage sacred although the last thing i want to look to be doing is making excuses for adultery what he did was wrong the john edwards incident begs americans to look in the mirror if we think what john edwards did with rielle hunter is wrong why do we think its wrong because marriage is at the foundation of our society and we should do what we can to protect every last one or simply because having fun while your wife is fighting a fatal disease is a lousy thing to do i dont know how we can condemn john edwards when americans have been known to cheer for cheaters in movies watch celebs do it all the time as a form of perverse entertainment and even insist were not sure what exactly marriage means
5876208 if you believe what you like in the gospels and reject what you dont like it is not the gospel you believe but yourself

5876210 and let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle
5876211 the ultimate determinant in the struggle now going on for the world will not be bombs and rockets but a test of wills and ideas a trial of spiritual resolve the values we hold the beliefs we cherish and the ideals to which we are dedicated

5876220 it is prudent to minimize arsenic exposure while its effect on metabolic diseases continues to be researched
5876221 i cant even be up there with her because every time i fly up there it costs us 600 to 700 return
5876222 so obviously that is money that could keep her up there for another week or two
5876223 i dont expect them to pay the full amount but there should be a program to pay half or a percentage something
5876224 this doesnt happen very often where we get this kind of request so if we open up for one we are afraid it will open a floodgate for others and we just cant go down that road
5876225 there are programs that these organizations have not sure about lung transplants but funds are available in some incidents

5876227 nonetheless our finding also suggests that individuals who survive into the highest ages have a health profile that is similar in many aspects to that of individuals who are seven or eight years younger
5876228 even though individuals in this age range have an increased risk of disability for each additional year of life the frailest and most disabled members of the cohort are those who are most likely to die at any given age
5876229 most individuals can expect to experience physical decline before they die but the postponement of this individual decline makes it possible for us to live into a fourth age

5876234 im honored to share the stage with tampa and st petes song writing elite
5876235 as well as blessed to have made a friend who believes in me as much as joran slane
5876236 i want to talk to so and so in person about this certain matter and not interrupt their vacation
5876237 from now on they are not allowed to talk to any of the coaches they can give them time checks in the countdown to when they are ready to roll and thats it
5876238 well let them race there will be a handshake before they start and we will let them go there will be no camps no sides
5876239 that was the fairest way to do it because one of them could have said to me oh jasons riding this gear or something
5876240 it was very clear they wanted to be level and fair it was difficult because normally you have a chat about how are you going to beat this guy and we were on our own this time
5876241 it was exactly the same in one way you have a plan and a plan b but you get used to being told what this guy is going to do so about 10 minutes before the race it was like what i am going to do so you have to think about it and you think i have ridden a couple of these races in the past you just try to do the basic things right
5876242 from the outside it looks as if you are all calm and everything is great but theres always doubts you have you try to push them out and focus on the job you have to do i didnt think about three gold medals not even today i wasnt thinking about that i was thinking purely about the sprint itself the technical elements because if you break it down it takes care of itself
5876243 we knew it was a five day event not just two or three like a world cup ive trained hard on my recovery a lot of hard efforts with short recovery time its paid off psychologically you know you have it when you come to the tough bits
5876244 the olympics the gold medal thats the factor if it wasnt for the olympics probably after the kilometre was dropped id have thought thats it its the desire to rekindle that feeling of what it is to be olympic champion it wouldnt matter if it was in the team sprint or the keirin table tennis volleyball id do any sport for that
5876245 even though i was in a decent position some pretty bad spiking halfway round hurt me a bit and when i tried to push on with the leaders i just couldnt
5876246 still no regrets no excuses i did all i could i am disappointed to finish so far down the field especially after doing so well in the heats but this is motivation for me and ill go away work hard and come back fitter and stronger next time
5876247 you hit a hurdle about twice a year where it affects your race
5876248 its just a shame that it was on the biggest race of my life its like when you are in a racing car and you hit a curve either you can maintain control or you can crash and burn today i crashed and burned
5876249 i always said that as long as i am injury free i am good enough to make finals
5876250 i think besides bolt it is pretty wide open i am a little bit surprised how easy he is making it look but anything can happen in a final
5876251 we were given a breakdown of the tickets sold to the general public and the nocs

5876262 and i dont think i could repeat them if i did remember
5876263 the psychology of what drives me as a person has been essential getting everything in perspective getting me in the right mind frame my expectations were too high i was beating myself up psychologically at every moment it was knocking me back
5876264 i painted my nails a few times watched the tv struggled to find something to eat because obviously you havent much of an appetite went on the rollers just biding my time
5876265 the pressure was mounting because i wanted to do what theyve done and win a medal it was important to be part of that this week watching the guys perform gave me some experience of what it must be like being a parent i was a mess watching them and there was nothing i could do because they were on tv i was like woh is that how my mum and dad feel because that is awful and i felt quite guilty how dare i inflict that on someone else
5876266 we are friends we have been friends from way back in 2002
5876267 i am very happy for him to me it does not really matter who he competes for
5876268 i spend six months of the year in jamaica training with stephen francis and i come back to europe to do the european circuit
5876269 that no funding is one of the things that motivated me to come out here and do my best track and field is not a sport that pays a lot it was very tough but i am here a silver medallist
5876270 i feel very british britain is my home and that is where it is going to be forever
5876271 i am super duper right now my hopes going into the olympics were very good i have been jumping consistently in my last few meets and this is the olympics anything can happen and there is no medal for any specific person
5876272 i just wanted to go out there and do the best i could i did that i equalled my personal best and i won a silver medal
5876273 usain and i competed at a lot of games together when i was competing for jamaica we are good friends he gave me a pat on the back tonight and he told me well done

5876277 were excited about the quality of the six players that weve added to our program both on and off the field
5876278 we were left with some holes in our roster due to the graduation of a terrific senior class and the loss of three top notch juniors who were drafted by major league clubs but we feel that the addition of this group of signees will keep us in the hunt for a southern conference championship
5876279 the ou initiative is the only major u s initiative of its kind devoted to the problem of biodeterioration and biocorrosion
5876280 first we have to understand how mother nature cleans up these spills and we can do this by studying the way microorganisms interact with hydrocarbons
5876281 we want to better understand how organisms eat through these pipelines several fundamental mechanisms cause this problem but it is spotty and doesnt occur all of a sudden rather biocorrosion occurs over a long period of time and we are using a series of new molecular and chemical tools to find out why and how this happens
5876282 we think cells grow in communities that adhere to the inner surface of pipelines and form three dimensional biofilms that can sometimes cause pitting once we understand what these microorganisms are doing we can interrupt their processes or diagnose them more effectively the science is rudimentary at this stage the modern tools of molecular microbiology have not been applied yet but a national science foundation grant support from the does joint genome institute and the cooperation of the energy industry allowed us to study pipeline biocorrosion on the north slope
5876283 for many years no one ever thought anaerobes could grow by metabolizing hydrocarbons in the absence of oxygen but that is simply wrong the organisms are actually quite good at it the underlying mechanisms will be even more important as we introduce newer biofuels to augment our fossil fuel supply we are putting new fuel combinations into the existing pipelines that service the entire country the new biofuels can be less stable so there is a different problem to deal with the chemistry of biofuels may not allow us to store them as long and more research is needed to determine the stability compatability and composition of such fuel mixtures

5876326 in every race i went to i lost in a sprint to the finish what it teaches you is you have to pace yourself and wait for the right moment to go when i saw simon take off i knew that there were 500 meters left i had practiced all of this in my mind over and over simon is a fast guy but i think he went a little bit early i actually thought hed come back to me but i just focused myself on looking forward never turning back

5876334 backing them up will be a couple of local products forward midfielder
5876335 moving back into the midfield our midfield is going to be anchored by senior midfielder defense
5876336 at the back we feel very good about our back line defense chelsea potts anchors the middle chelseas an all sec performer entering her junior year as well shell be flanked by defense katherine lagow another rising junior who missed most of last season through injury but is an all sec type player if shes on form during the course of the year at right back is nikki bush who is another rising junior shes very consistent often underrated by outsiders shell be a good steady performer for us then weve got defense veronica godbolt who has won a bit of a position battle during preseason weve got a very veteran laden team and we really only had one spot up for grabs coming into the fall and it looks like veronica will get the start coming up on friday night shes had a very good camp mo isom one of the top goalkeeper recruits in the country for those of you who have been to lsu soccer games in the past its a different look for us in goal shes 60 61
5876337 well soccer is a little unique in that positionally if youve got a big time goal keeper and youve got a big time goal scorer everything else can kind of fall into place shes young i dont want to put the overburden of big expectations on her but shes good she spent the spring with us which i thought was extremely big a spring in the weight room and she was able to get comfortable i think shell help us
5876338 well were older than we were we recruited a talented group when we got here we signed a fairly talented nationally recruited class since then weve kind of tweaked it theyre experienced theyve been through the ringer and they know each others motions in the back line and up front theres a lot to be said for continuity chelsea potts have a great relationship in terms of understanding each others movements really we try to defend from the front backwards roslyn jones are as hard a working pair on the defensive end of forwards as there is in the nation we feel good about ourselves defensively

5876345 sometimes it is difficult to know what a politician will actually do once in office because they say different things at different times to different people
5876346 this is a particular problem when a candidate has a short thin record on the issues as in the case of senator obama let me say just in case senator obama does decide to return to his original plan of cutting nasa funding i oppose such cuts
5876347 i will ensure that space exploration remains a top priority and that the u s continues to lead the world in this field
5876348 its very interesting to see mccain now paint himself as a strong supporter of nasa

5876355 along with other prisoners he worked in the fields day after day in rain and sun during summer and winter his life appeared to be nothing more than backbreaking labor and slow starvation the intense suffering reduced him to a state of despair on one particular day the hopelessness of his situation became too much for him he saw no reason to continue his struggle no reason to keep on living his life made no difference in the world so he gave up leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners as he waited head down he felt a presence slowly he looked up and saw a skinny old prisoner squat down beside him the man said nothing instead he used a stick to trace in the dirt the sign of the cross the man then got back up and returned to his work as solzhenitsyn stared at the cross drawn in the dirt his entire perspective changed he knew he was only one man against the all powerful soviet empire yet he knew there was something greater than the evil he saw in the prison camp something greater than the soviet union he knew that hope for all people was represented by that simple cross through the power of the cross anything was possible solzhenitsyn slowly rose to his feet picked up his shovel and went back to work outwardly nothing had changed inside he had received hope
5876356 perhaps it had never been focus he lacked but rather a goal worthy of his focus

5876458 sangat bisa dipertanggung jawabkan jika kita menyebut ibnu khaldun sebagai salah seorang bapak ilmu ekonomi
5876459 al fikr al iqtisadi fi muqaddimat ibn khaldun economic though in the prolegomena of ibn khaldun selain itu kita memiliki sumbangan sumbangan kajian yang berlimpah tentang ibnu khaldun ini menunjukkan kebesaran dan kepeloporan ibnu khaldun sebagai intelektual terkemuka yang telah merumuskan pemikiran pemikiran briliyan tentang ekonomi rosenthal misalnya telah menulis karya ibn khaldun the muqaddimah an introduction to history spengler menulis buku economic thought of islam ibn khaldun boulakia menulis ibn khaldun a fourteenth century economist ahmad ali menulis economics of ibn khaldun a selection ibn al sabil menulis islami ishtirakiyat fil islam abdul qadir ibn khaldun ke maashi khayalat

5876461 kesanggupan seseorang untuk mendapatkan makanannya sendiri tidak cukup baginya untuk mempertahankan hidupnya karena kebutuhannya bukan sekedar makanan
5876462 untuk itu diperlukan adanya pembagaian kerja division of labour antara individu dalam masyarakat karena manusia tidak bisa memenuhi kebutuhannya sendiri pasti tergantung pada orang lain
5876463 penghidupan orang orang yang tidak punya dan orang oarng desa

5876466 pendapat kita bahwa kehidupan desa mendahului dan menjadi asal kehidupan kota dikuatkan dengan kenyataan bahwa penyelidikan tentang nenek moyang penduduk kota mana saja akan memberikan bukti bahwa sebahagian besar mereka berasal dari desa yang bedekatan dengan kota tempat nenek moyang mereka itu mereka datang sewaktu mereka sudah dapat memperbaiki kehidupannya dan beralih kepada kehidupan yang penuh kesengajaan dan kemewahan yang ada di kota ini menunjukkan bahwa masyarakat desa lebih dulu terwujud ketimbang masyarakat kota
5876467 dan untuk mencukupi kebutuhannya para petani dan peternak hewan terpaksa pergi ke teempat tempat lain yang masih terbuka luas yang tidak terdapat di kota kota untuk persawahan pengembalaan dan sebagainya yang dimaksud dengan orang kota ialah orang orang yang tinggal di kota kota di antara mereka ada yang memperoleh penghidupannya dari industri dan perdagangan pengahasilan mereka lebih besar daripada penghasil kelompok yang bekerja dalam bidang pertanian dan peternakan hewan yang tinggal di desa

5876475 nilai barang terletak pada kuantitas relatif dari kerja kuantitas yang diperlukan untuk memproduksinya dan bukan terletak pada upah yang diberika dalam kerja ini

5876493 for people to suggest that i and the illinois medical society so illinois doctors were somehow in favor of withholding lifesaving support from an infant born alive is ridiculous
5876494 barack obama is so radically pro abortion he supports infanticide
5876495 the suggestion that obama the proud father of two little girls and others who opposed these bills supported infanticide is deeply offensive and insulting
5876496 he needs to explain misleading people he needs to explain why he apparently covered that up
5876497 theyre being very dishonest about their depiction of what happened with that bill or just clueless

5876513 the attack on camp salerno in khost province was one of the most complex attacks seen so far in afghanistan with multiple suicide bombers and a backup fighting force that tried to breach defenses on to the airport at the base
5876514 thats all it was a series of vehicles that went out there
5876515 people are saying that this was a full up forward operating base combat outpost and that is absolutely false and not true there were no walls
5876516 fob denotes that there are walls and perimeters and all that its a vehicle patrol base temporary in nature

5876533 personally from a guys standpoint i prefer an experienced woman i mean do women ever think that a guy has been with too many women or do they just accept it once you have both sewn your wild oats then you are comfortable with your own body and more open to new things i think that when two people have had many partners and then find each other and settle down then they each receive the benefit of the pleasure that the other has learned to give by perfecting their skills besides its only a number and your past is what makes you who you are today good luck

5876552 when i got really obsessed with an album id write them the band a letter
5876553 what i really wanted was someone to pay attention to me as a teenager and respond
5876554 i cant think of anything else i want to listen to
5876555 im feeling really indecisive lately about everything not just music i dont know how i want to dress how to cut my hair which music to listen to and who to hang out with
5876556 a movement encompassing zines festivals and hardcore punk rock music groups known for its feminist stance
5876557 i want to be living in the city not the suburbs
5876558 i want to dye my hair crazy colours and play in a band and go to concerts and have other girls around me who want to do the same things
5876559 comes from finding your place in a scene this idea that youre becoming an expert in something
5876560 marlies not listening to the sex pistols or the clash
5876561 the thing that really takes her in is the band that shes a part of she doesnt worry about punk cred marlie is driven by her riot grrrl politics
5876562 i know about riot grrrl i know about this scene
5876563 i saw all the bands i ever wanted to see
5876564 learned to skateboard and did lots of cool stuff and came back and said im going to write a book now
5876565 really pushing the envelope with sexing it up for young girls
5876566 sen mccain was crisp decisive knew what he was about knew his values
5876567 does evil exist and if it does do we ignore it do we negotiate with it do we contain it do we defeat it
5876568 evil does exist i mean i think we see evil all the time we see evil in darfur we see evil sadly on the streets of our cities it has to be confronted squarely i think it is very important for to us have some humility in how we approach the issue of confronting evil because a lot of evils been perpetrated based on the claim that we were trying to confront evil in the name of good j ust because we think that our intentions are good doesnt always mean that were going to be doing good
5876569 but i say to you do not resist one who is evil
5876570 he who is slow to anger is better than the mighty
5876571 a man of quick temper acts foolishly but a man of discretion is patient
5876572 he who is slow to anger has great understanding but he who has a hasty temper exalts folly
5876573 a hot tempered man stirs up strife but he who is slow to anger quiets contention
5876574 let every man be quick to hear slow to speak slow to anger for the anger of man does not work the righteousness of god
5876575 how honest are we if we tell the truth most of the time amp
5876576 if we desire to walk fully with christ there is a cost the bible is clear that humans do not achieve greatness without having their sinful will broken this process is designed to create a nature change in us not just a habit change the bible calls it circumcision circumcision is painful bloody and personal
5876577 if god has plans to greatly use you in the lives of others you can expect your trials to be great why because like joseph who went through greater trials than most your calling may have responsibility that god cannot afford to entrust to you without ensuring your complete faithfulness to the call he has much invested in you on behalf of others he may want to speak through your life to a different degree than another the events of your life become the framework for the message he wants to speak through you
5876578 una perspectiva refrescante como si fuera un extra o cuento de hadas
5876579 my dream had always been to bridge japan and asia to hollywood and the west and tokyopop being a platform for that bridge
5876580 now that we have this platform we are able to move into development work with creators in asia as well as locally and try to experiment with this sort of storytelling from the ground up
5876581 its almost like a candy store you start reading one and before you know it youve read a hundred and you like them all the key is which one is most adaptable to the type of movie you want to do
5876582 hollywood is still grasping with what is it about graphic novels or sequential art that truly would make a successful film
5876583 is it the fact that everybodys heard of spider man or is there something inherent about the medium of sequential art and the graphic novel that allows for a film to be adapted in a more efficient or effective manner
5876584 i thought it would be a more hardcore selling process
5876585 we have to educate them on what we do and our mentality because our approach isnt necessarily traditional
5876586 were not just selling rights were really trying to show that we can make film in the way that we make a manga or make a book and we can do a top quality job of that as opposed to just handing it off to the pros and letting them do with our stories what they think is appropriate and thats a bit of a battle
5876587 are there things that we should always do in a film
5876588 almost every single one of our stories if you look at them has a fantastical element to it so for us i believe we will always have a twist visually
5876589 its definitely not always the most obvious or easiest translation to the bigscreen or television
5876590 i want to be the first guy to do that
5876591 we can try different things and see what ultimately works best for tokyopop
5876592 nu are o idee clar asupra preliminariilor pentru mondialul din 2010

5876635 our earth is deteriorating and as much as we try to convey the message were still going to be using our cars were still going to be wasting our energy by showing people this exhibit it will educate people about what we can do
5876636 one idea is to have a lot of murals and public art
5876637 we were working with artists who really believed that art could bring the community together we wanted to bring together different cultures through public art we set up an outdoor stage for performers
5876638 there was this one girl who was into bringing a lot of culture i was interested in bringing technology it was interesting bringing all these ideas into one plan
5876639 hes refusing to sign the conditions the judge imposed on him yesterday
5876640 his attorney made it clear he was going to agree to the new terms
5876641 the court basically said the defendant has the option at any time to sign the conditions of release
5876642 if he does so the jail will release him if not and he chooses to remain in custody the court date will remain as previously set
5876643 when you really look at the investigators involved and the procedures they followed they were all within what has been defined as appropriate in every medical field
5876644 to block access to this protocol is really hurting the people who need it most
5876645 theres much more influence relative to day to day prescribing
5876646 this attack is causing us to go back to the system we had before with individual doctors who may have individual influence instead of using a standardized protocol
5876647 in our country theres been a switch from taking care of people to focusing on big corporate money
5876648 there need to be restrictions on how these things are done because the victims are our children

5876669 new notion of circus based on male and female acrobatics and oriented to a gay and lesbian friendly audience
5876670 for the first time in the world a circus created for lovers of high quality shows and of a culture for the emotional and sexual diversity a contribution to the normalisation of homosexuality
5876671 currently we can find references to gay games ballet performances theatre literature and cinema with a homosexual oriented thematic
5876672 however theres no previous circus conceived from a gay angle and which aims at a wider audience in favour of a greater visibility of homosexuality
5876673 gay circus will transform the traditional understanding of the circus
5876674 expressiveness sensuality and poetry will fuse achieving an up to date modern and attractive aesthetic
5876675 gay circus flows like a dialogue between angels and devils the eternal dispute between good and evil set now on a ring with numerous references to literature painting dance sculpture photography and cinema

5876701 speaker silver and members of the assembly have offered a roadmap to solving the very real problem of property taxes that bear no relation to what working and middle class families can afford
5876702 its time to let democracy work its time the state senate notices that more than 15 000 new yorkers reached out to their legislators and the governor to say that the so called property tax cap is nothing more than an arbitrary restriction on local investment in public education that does nothing to address the property tax mess

5876951 the shares are trading on cy08e and cy09e p e of 10 times and 8 5 times respectively in line with the wider consultancy average pe of 10 5 times and 9 3 times
5876952 the u s is not out of the woods i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps i would even go further to say the worst is to come
5876953 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
5876954 we have to see more consolidation in the financial sector before this is over
5876955 there was this view early on in the crisis that sovereign wealth funds could save everybody
5876956 that view neglects the point that the financial system has become very bloated in size and needed to shrink
5876957 the lack of any reaction to putins attack for five days was followed by that stupid remark about the stock market
5876958 so this is the president do we have a president in russia at all it seems that we do not
5876959 television shapes public opinion on the tv screen putin looks more resolute than medvedev he uses strong words and has an image as a tough politician the masses like it

5876961 people are wary of draining their battery and not being able to make calls battery life isnt helped by having gps and wi fi turned on nor by having a large bright screen for navigation or web browsing
5876962 but there is clear demand for those features and applications and advances in battery technology would enable quite substantial changes in usage patterns with all the service revenue benefits that would bring
5876963 people used to genuinely fear that they would lose their jobs if they were outed and many did

5876968 en lo que concierne a un segundo est mulo no creo que estemos all en este momento

5876972 ah he she isnt such a bad person theres no sense in sending them away so they lose their job
5876973 i just wanted to kind of be rid of it
5876974 so this was the choice i made and it was a tough one

5876980 i understand drugs for high blood pressure for diabetes but i know mikie and i didnt need emotional stabilizers to live our lives
5876981 the people who are most respected are the ones who talk to drug companies who become consultants for multiple companies because their opinion is really valued
5876982 we prescribe the medication that works best for the patient irrespective of our relationship with a drug company
5876983 if a physician talks to all the companies and prescribes for all the companies then no company has an edge
5876984 in order to ensure that the data procured is as reliable and accurate as possible
5876985 clinical research is a critical element in the development of revolutionary medicines that help patients live longer healthier lives
5876986 you could take statistics and bar charts and make them look pretty much how you wanted them to
5876987 i saw firsthand several circumstances where my minimization of side effects or misinforming a physician had actually resulted in the patient being damaged and or killed
5876988 it makes me wonder what real safeguards there are here to protect foster children in texas from being involved in clinical trials
5876989 whether any wrong is being done or not theres certainly the perception
5876990 but i dont sit there and think hey a concerta rep came in today
5876991 there is more data out for the newer drugs which makes doctors more likely to use them thats why it appears theres something unethical going on with the drug companies when theres not
5876992 he was given three times the amount given to adult patients each of these drugs was given to us by a child psychiatrist
5876993 he was supposed to be in state care but nobody was looking after evan but me
5876994 now my kids dont take medications i wont ever trust doctors again
5876995 the state takes a child that is upset crying yelling and screaming because theyve just been taken from their families and with all those symptoms prescribes them medication
5876996 they think that if the child is unruly its easier to deal with them by medicating them than by counseling
5876997 its a medical model we didnt have any other options
5876998 i always questioned if they didnt need them out there in the real world why do they need them in here but i wasnt about to go against the doctors orders
5876999 were a lot more confident today that children who dont need these medications arent getting them

5877013 its really how we observe what were made out of

5877015 i want to be able to understand music and the orchestra as well as suzie its just a personal goal of mine

5877017 what i mean by renewal is bringing together elements of those things that are new
5877018 ive been fortunate enough to make music and travel around the world with my best friends having lived the life of a pirate the last 12 years i definitely will appreciate studying much more than i ever have at any other point in my life
5877019 music is something i feel like i have to do all the time and i guess its just more a series of emotional landscapes than anything
5877020 the color of an object depends on both the physics of the object in its environment and the characteristics of the perceiving eye and brain
5877021 to summarize the color of an object is a complex result of its surface properties its transmission properties and its emission properties all of which factors contribute to the mix of wavelengths in the light leaving the surface of the object the perceived color is then further conditioned by the nature of the ambient illumination and by the color properties of other objects nearby via the effect known as color constancy and via other characteristics of the perceiving eye and brain
5877022 two consecutive elevated readings on core consumer prices combined with todays worrisome report on producer prices will be hard for the fed to overlook at its next meeting

5877050 the fact is oregon is part of the larger regional national and really global animal
5877051 slower levels of economic growth and likely recession mean demand for oregon goods tends to dissipate theres less spending around the country and really around the globe
5877052 results were significantly affected by further declines in the us housing market where housing starts fell 35 per cent in the first quarter compared to the same period last year
5877053 our main businesses operated in markets that were affected by downturns particularly in the us where the downturn was the most severe
5877054 despite this we continued to focus on driving primary demand for fibre cement products in north america with strategies aimed at increasing our share of the us siding and backer board markets
5877055 although we expect our volume to remain below the previous year as a result of a continuing decline in housing markets we expect our differentiated product strategy will allow us to maintain selling price and increase market share
5877056 taking a path to the rearmament of the current leaders in georgia
5877057 on the whole all of these threats that have been raining down on russia turned out to be empty words
5877058 with russian troops deep inside georgia murdering and raping its people what does this new nato georgia commission do for us
5877059 i think we should still engage with the russians but in a hard headed way and we mustnt allow the russians to feel they are the victims of this affair when they are the transgressors
5877060 do foreigners now need russian visas to travel within georgia
5877061 these results confirm that the confidence we have expressed in the past six months about our guidance was well founded
5877062 our balance sheet is stronger and gives us the flexibility to pursue disciplined growth from a number of identified opportunities
5877063 notwithstanding the current turmoil in world financial markets and slowing economies the demand for contracting services remains strong particularly within the iron ore coal and government sectors
5877064 subject to the timing of new work 2009 full year profit growth is likely be at the higher end of the 20 to 30 per cent range

5877068 this could be one of the biggest breaks for the early clinical application of embryonic stem cells
5877069 there is still work to be done but we could certainly be studying these cells clinically within the next year or two

5877077 weve got the helicopters the sukoi fighters and were now considering buying some russian submarines to patrol our territorial waters
5877078 we find that this final rule will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities establishments with above average costs and even establishments with average costs could be hard pressed to continue to operate some of these may decide it is too costly and either change product lines or go out of business 140 very small less than 20 employees and 32 small dietary supplement manufacturers less than 500 employees will be at risk of going out of business costs per establishment are proportionally higher for very small than for large establishments the regulatory costs of this final rule will also discourage new small businesses from entering the industry
5877079 we expect that the majority of these costs will be borne by consumers of dietary supplements who will likely respond to the increase in prices by reducing consumption
5877080 dead zones were once rare now theyre commonplace there are more of them in more places

5877083 were actually projecting this year that the north pole may be free of ice for the first time in history
5877084 this summers forecast and unusual early melting events all around the arctic serve as a dire warning of how quickly the polar regions are being affected by climate change
5877085 if norways average temperature this year equals that in 2007 the ice cap in the arctic will all melt away which is highly possible judging from current conditions
5877086 the arctic did not experience the meltdowns forecast by nsidc and the norwegian polar year secretariat it didnt even come close additionally some current graphs and press releases from nsidc seem less than conservative there appears to be a consistent pattern of overstatement related to arctic ice loss

5877092 its kind of a trend when it comes to issues of canada u s relations and contentious issues like military integration
5877093 we see that this government is reluctant to disclose information to canadians that is readily available on american and mexican websites
5877094 this document is a unique bilateral military plan to align our respective national military plans to respond quickly to the other nations requests for military support of civil authorities
5877095 in discussing the new bilateral civil assistance plan established by usnorthcom and canada command renuart stressed
5877096 the signing of this plan is an important symbol of the already strong working relationship between canada command and u s northern command
5877097 our commands were created by our respective governments to respond to the defense and security challenges of the twenty first century
5877098 and we both realize that these and other challenges are best met through cooperation between friends
5877099 its no great secret why the jewish agencies continue to trumpet support for the discredited policies of this failed administration they see defense of israel as their number one goal trumping all other items on the agenda
5877100 its no great secret why the jewish agencies continue to trumpet support for the discredited policies of this failed administration they see defense of israel as their number one goal trumping all other items on the agenda that single mindedness binds them ever closer to a white house that has made combating islamic terrorism its signature campaign the campaigns effects on the world have been catastrophic but that is no concern of the jewish agencies

5877107 the fact is that during senator obamas segment at saddleback last night senator mccain was in a motorcade to the event and then held in a green room with no broadcast feed
5877108 now my first question was the cone of silence comfortable that you were in just now
5877109 a year ago i said i would take action against bin laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights and pakistan cannot or will not act senator mccain criticized me and said i was for bombing our ally

5877126 in current uncertain market conditions its neither good to be a lender nor a borrower
5877127 with such an array of financial products to choose from it can be tempting to turn to a price comparison site to do the legwork for you
5877128 but you might be very confused to find that different sites can give you vastly different quotes and often dont give enough information for you to make an informed choice
5877129 you need to use two or three comparison sites and check directly with providers to get the best quote and remember that cheapest isnt always best its a false economy if you dont get enough cover for your needs or have to pay a huge excess if you claim

5877186 cone of silence issue that seems to be the buzzword of the week after mccain seems to have done well in a debate
5877187 he said he was going to kill him and he used the word kill i will never forget the look on that guys face when he said that for whatever reason but it hit me right between the eyes
5877188 this isnt so much about what trent was its more about what he could have been what he could have been for us
5877189 it also opens it up for more areas to have outdoor events such as the thursday night live
5877190 i bet business owners on this block would pay the lost revenue from those parking spots
5877191 children will not remember you for the material things you provided but for the feeling that you cherished them
5877192 the deep pain that is felt at the death of every friendly soul arises from the feeling that there is in every individual something which is inexpressible peculiar to him alone and is therefore absolutely and irretrievably lost
5877193 that was very unprofessional he should have given you a better interview
5877194 did not use all means to respond then but if lebanon becomes a hezbollah state then we wont have any restrictions in this regard
5877195 massive capabilities and tools during the second lebanon war that it refrained from using because it was fighting a terror organization not a state
5877196 there will no longer be a situation of distant fighting where major cities continue with life as usual the war will reach the cities and homes of israeli citizens and our enemys objective will be to target the homefront
5877197 we will be forced to bring an end to hostilities quickly at the smallest possible cost using our comparative advantage
5877198 you have to deal with the rain if you want the rainbow
5877199 what is really frustrating is to have a second devastating fire occur in the same area under basically the same conditions despite the amount of information that has been made available over the years through public education programs that promote defensible space
5877200 i wish they would recommend people would clean up their sage brush in their backyard
5877201 a garden hose like that doesnt do anything against a fire like that
5877202 my shirt caught on fire that year thats how hot it was i learned my lesson from that year

5877212 all this i have told you so that you will not go astray
5877213 ok so heres the deal your duty as a host is to provide as many of the comforts of home as you reasonably can your duty as a guest is to adapt to your hosts home without complaint and to thank them properly afterwards
5877214 thank you for letting me stay i had a great time
5877215 what is there to say i still love him but everything is different now im sad the money is gone and i wish it was there to help us now starting out but glen why would he do something like that without telling me and why wouldnt he tell me weeks ago when it happened
5877216 the only thing i could imagine is that he thought hed make 85 000 and then more and that youd be excited when you found out what he had done with your money
5877217 but i wouldnt have been excited glen id be almost as upset as i am now
5877218 this isnt about money at all of course this is about secrets and judgment and trust
5877219 exactly he doesnt see that even now hes already talking about how hes going to make it up to me by doing better next time
5877220 so i guess for him its all about the results its a game that you win or lose and he lost next time he thinks hell win it for you but even if he does which is a serious question mark right now will he keep you involved
5877221 thats the hardest part last night i asked him to help me get some of the chores done and he said this is about the money isnt it that hurts me too
5877222 he isnt seeing his wife in this is he hes feeling bad like a a doctor who failed to cure his patients cancer feels bad he is thinking of you as his client and hes notifying his client of some bad news he believes you are blaming him for your financial state its confusing too because you might be blaming him a little bit for that but you need to confront him and let him know that from now on you are a team and you must always communicate and pray together before you act there can be no secrets any more he needs to understand that now
5877223 i tried to do that last night glen he said he didnt want to talk to me about it because he thought id discourage him from doing it and i dont know if i would have maybe i would have asked him to maybe only invest half of the money i dont know but he says you have to play big to win big
5877224 well if he doesnt learn this now your marriage will be in jeopardy so you really need to get this right and you need to speak with love and compassion and remember that deep down hes full of confusion and self doubt and hes beating himself up
5877225 he needs to learn that from now on when he has motivations temptations desires goals and dreams he must confess them to you
5877226 its clear from the things hes saying that he does not yet understand this and frankly that means to me that he is not yet ready for marriage so youre going to have to teach him this and its not going to be easy and the worst part is he may never understand this and then you will suffer being married to him
5877227 please dont tell him that i told you all this glen hell be upset that im telling you about our finances
5877228 i certainly wont but you must it goes both ways there can be no secrets especially if they will disappoint or hurt him my dear this is the starting line the job in front of you is arduous and terrifying today is the day you choose to be naked and unashamed or you start wearing fig leaves forever

5877239 we came out this afternoon and worked a lot on special teams
5877240 we got maybe 40 minutes work on special teams and then some situations coming out from the minus 1 how to end the game in what we call kill the clock offense and get the ball back on defense and then two minutes then we did some walk through stuff for our opener so it was a pretty short practice last two a day so im sure that the players are fired up about that
5877241 we got a lot of really good work on special teams
5877242 a lot of detail work and then hit some things that you have to spend time on that you dont really have time to do like sky kicks onside hands team all the things you have to have ready for that first game
5877243 weve been working jarius wright back there joe adams dennis johnson
5877244 weve really got four guys working in the secondary at the safety position
5877245 we are trying to make sure that we know both positions elton ford and matt harris have been working a lot at free safety and matt also runs over at strong safety dallas washington is there at strong safety and is doing a good job he knows what to do at the jack linebacker position that we have now and rashaad johnson plays both so its really a four man rotation and we feel that all four will play and as for who will start now i dont know but all four will rotate in and need to stay fresh
5877246 he was from california and that the gangs there were the best
5877247 ive been trying to think of ways to spice up my life
5877248 calmness in the lebanese national scene is a national interest its not the interest of any specific party or side or group
5877249 if the aim waad to further one sides electoral gains then it has to be postponed
5877250 the convergence of usually different muslim or christian or muslim and christian groups should be in principle a source of happiness and comfort for lebanon since it helps us prove to the whole world that there is still a large space for dialogue and accepting the other and it shows readiness for cooperation between the lebanese citizens
5877251 il circondarsi di mistero pu avere anche unaltra origine oltre a quella manifesta di sviare i non iniziati alla realizzazione della pietra il vero segreto non ricorre mai a messe in scena misteriose per parla in modo misterioso allude a se stesso attraverso una variet di immagini che accennano alla sua vera natura non intendo con ci un segreto custodito personalmente da qualcuno e avente un contenuto noto alla persona che lo possiede bens un fatto o una faccenda segreta misteriosa cio nota soltanto per allusioni e accenni ma ignota nella sua essenza cos allalchimista era ignota la vera natura della materia egli la conosceva soltanto per allusioni tentando di indagarla egli proiettava sulloscurit della materia per illuminarla linconscio per spiegare il mistero della materia proiettava un altro mistero e precisamente il proprio retroscena psichico sconosciuto su ci che doveva essere spiegato obsurum per obscurius ignotum per ignotius questo non era beninteso un metodo intenzionale ma un accadimento involontario

5877256 he doesnt sleep if we lose trying to figure out what he could have done differently to help us get better it is about the team and the girls not about him

5877258 the expedition will be mentally and physically challenging but is nothing compared to what our armed forces go through for us
5877259 the walk is not about politics it is about helping those who are brave enough to serve their country and are wounded whilst doing so
5877260 if we met now i dont even think wed be friends
5877261 we typically think about new fitness goals and programs around the new year but the fall is just as timely
5877262 summers over and we get back into a more predictable pace theres a greater willingness to find a little time for physical activity plus we start realizing the holidays arent that far away and we want to look good in our holiday outfits
5877263 the key is to do something no matter how simple
5877264 once you make up your mind to pick up the physical activity its easy to find community resources like us to help you keep going
5877265 even though we have spent our lives in mexico our mother is a fan of that music and since we were very young we have listened to it so we think it is very special to sing it in spanish
5877266 we wanted to record in nashville because the best country musicians are there
5877267 after finishing our second cd mundos opuestos opposite worlds it was very important for us to take some time to keep silent and find out about our feelings what we wanted to say and how to say it we traveled a lot on tours before we were able to start composing the songs
5877268 traveling enriches your life as a person because you realize that this world is not just you your family and friends
5877269 you realize that there is more culture there are languages foods other ways of life and that helped us to grow and live
5877270 that song is about resignation because you realize your relationship becomes repetitive in order to avoid accepting the fact there isnt any love left
5877271 at that moment you have to stop to avoid living out of habit
5877272 we wrote it on a bus on our way to nashville to record after saying goodbye to our family in louisiana
5877273 the feeling we wanted to explore was the sense of being more independent at the same time that we value our family more
5877274 our golden dream is for this cd to cross borders along with us
5877275 the result of your action is that you are supporting the regime of a terrorist organization in gaza
5877276 the israeli authorities will ensure that the shipment reaches its destination via the land crossing points
5877277 is political and constitutes the legitimization of a terrorist organization
5877278 its not clear if the letter from the israeli ministry of foreign affairs signals a change of policy or is simply an attempt to open up an official dialogue
5877279 since the israeli foreign ministers office responded to our invitation to join us and said that we have good intentions we now fully expect to reach gaza

5877283 booth at first hates it but then he kind of turns around
5877284 says deschanel explaining that brennan a more sophisticated world traveler has an easier time of it working overseas
5877285 thats when our show is the best when people have to reveal their feelings in some way but we never get sentimental
5877286 hepburn and tracy kind of thing the witty stylish fond but confrontational relationship of brennan and booth
5877287 i think going into season four this should be the mark of what our show is you put these two characters in a misplaced environment thats where they operate best thats what brings out the best in their relationship
5877288 we are getting very good production value weve shot in places you cant believe we shot in front of the bank of england we are going to shoot right near tower bridge i thought it would be just a distant thing but its this close

5877293 the new york police department violated core constitutional rights when it arrested a group of peaceful demonstrators who were lawfully protesting against the commencement of the iraq war and those who stood to profit from it
5877294 we are gratified by the citys decision to compensate these individuals whose targeted arrests were without probable cause and intended to quell future protest in new york city this lawsuit and this settlement vindicates our clients rights to assemble and speak their mind free from the fear that they will be punished for their views
5877295 my question is why did the nypd send over 100 police in riot gear along with vehicles to block the street and disrupt the flow of morning rush hour traffic all to stop a legal peaceful protest when there are far more important matters they could be pursuing and why did they fight us in court so doggedly when they knew the evidence proved that we were arrested without any police orders to leave
5877296 we hope our victory helps convince the city to stop violating peoples rights as a matter of policy and stop wasting taxpayers money doing so
5877297 it should also serve as a reminder that washingtons illegal war in afghanistan and iraq is also being fought at home against its own citizens and in the name of war profiteers like carlyle and halliburton we intend to continue our resistance until this stops
5877298 no way man its china theyre the ones we gotta worry about

5877359 yes im away free shell never guess it was me
5877360 my clients are going to absolutely love this as much as i do
5877361 though lets be honest it is pornographic but in a very gentle way
5877362 we had a long history of quality goods and he wanted that name to be you know remain strong and thats why he took his passion of the bakery business to do it right or dont do it at all was his motto
5877363 we think by incorporating and having our own government and making our own decisions well be able to keep things how they are
5877364 its just a quiet lazy community we dont want condos we dont want tourists
5877365 but we would like to have a say so on how changes come about
5877366 i didnt plan to do that but once i had that extra drink i wasnt thinking
5877367 its an excitement an opportunity to serve others cause others have served you for so long now its time to give back
5877368 it doesnt matter where they need us we just go
5877369 it makes me feel worthwhile i know what its like not to have anybody in the area when we needed them
5877370 im just grateful i have the opportunity to do this when i get a chance
5877371 it was kind of a blessing i was injured the way i was because it gave me time to address that
5877372 then i got put on waivers so i had a chance to get home for my sons birth
5877373 a lot of the procedural issues necessary for instant replay to be implemented need to be worked out
5877374 major league baseball needs to step up to the plate and iron out these issues
5877375 im not going to go through these one by one i will tell you that on a number of them the comments are simply not accurate
5877376 for example weve had an understanding with the wua for some time that the crew chief and the crew chief only would be the one responsible for reviewing the video and making the decision on instant replay
5877377 there are other issues that remain to be worked out it is my general policy that i dont comment when im trying to bargain but i remain confident that were gong to be able to make a deal
5877378 thus there will be a lack of transparency and obviousness for the public as to what is going on when instant replay is under way
5877379 there may be situations where the umpires will have to leave the field in shifts so that everyone can view the video while leaving the requisite number of umpires on the field
5877380 this could create a laurel and hardy effect and may cause delay of game problems
5877381 he doesnt trust the teams to behave themselves in their absence
5877382 the umpires raised concerns and brought potential problems to solomons attention at least six weeks ago
5877383 no well traveled roads lead between man and animals but the distance is short evolution is not so much a ladder as an entire playground a number of communal spirits romp or grieve on the earth in different guises of fur or flesh or feathers to be born inside a random human womb and inhabit for a little while the erect rib cage is possibly no better and not much different than playing the game inside eagle wings or a dolphins slippery chest
5877384 the guaranteed stock piss pot storeroom their held if better self signort fit out acquired
5877385 if i never had to leave semmes again itd be fine with me
5877386 he wants the businesses that can put money in his pocket and take the tax base away from the citizens of semmes who are the ones who support these businesses
5877387 the guaranteed stock piss pot storeroom their held if better self signort fit out acquired
5877388 the guaranteed stock piss pot storeroom their held if better self signort fit out acquired
5877389 when youve been here and been through some of the things weve been through it would be a better atmosphere without nicole
5877390 she is quite negative about her experience in the big brother house
5877391 rachel has been really awkward with me she has been unusual
5877392 maybe its we just clash things doesnt ring right with rachel big brother she avoids eye contact with me and shell look away really quick
5877393 the brothers of astra heights grew up in texas but it took moving to los angeles for the power pop band to find its footing and land both a deal with universal records and uber producer david kahne paul mccartney the strokes to release last years good problems appropriately the bands sound fits right in with both of these artists classic catchy arrangements offering a blend of hooky radio rock that sits comfortably alongside diverse former tourmates like she wants revenge or even buddy guy judging by its tepid reception its unlikely to kick open doors the way the strokes did but astra heights proves that theres always room for another band built around classic pop played with a punky swagger
5877394 jesus mary and joseph i place my soul in your hands
5877395 i hope you will either quit this charade of catholics for mccain or actually get behind commit to and learn about the real policies of senator mccain
5877396 what about abortion marriage policies of obama what policy of mccains is of more severe proportion vocal
5877397 catholics for mccain censored at catholic voters conference in portland a report by carolyn wendell
5877398 the main problem is that they are guys for too long and never become men
5877399 they are i theorized stuck in the youth group culture the church has encouraged them to never leave that mentality and so it takes until about age 35 for them to extract themselves into adulthood land where the women have been waiting for years and have been steadily growing fed up men not raised in this evangelical youth culture ive noticed tend to be vastly different in maturity level
5877400 resolutions to start the war but i voted for those to send more troops over to die afterwards just like everyone else
5877401 i was one of the most vocal anti war politicians
5877402 meanwhile obama offered an artful dodge to the question of when a human deserves rights whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade he said like many of his responses that night it was a long careful nuanced plowing of middle ground he did not suggest that the only rights that matter are a womans over her body he also affirmed his moral dimensions of the issue he noted his willingness to limit late term abortions provided there is an exception if a womans health is at risk and he talked about finding the resources to help women who choose to keep their baby and about trying to reduce the need for abortions in the first place
5877403 im proud to be an american for the first time
5877404 i havent begun to narrow my list i like all the schools and am happy to be in this situation i have 29 offers and im looking at all of them
5877405 eventually probably around next month or a couple months from now ill look at what schools i want to visit
5877406 ill be looking for what every player wants the depth chart who is coming back who ill be battling with to see if ill see the field i want to become part of a family
5877407 ive known about it for a couple of days but im not one to talk about offers until i have them i came home from football practice around 2 15 looked through the mail and it was there
5877408 my favorites are probably south carolina south florida and rutgers
5877409 south carolina rutgers vanderbilt will be one of them after that im not sure
5877410 i have been talking to pittsburgh albany connecticut james madison and middle tennessee a lot recently
5877411 they have just told me that they want to see some senior film i know right now that some of those schools definitely have me higher on their boards than others
5877412 hicimos un buen trabajo colectivo estuvimos bien parados en todas las l neas y nos falt solo convertir
5877413 entendimos el mensaje hablamos durante la semana de que deb amos salir a jugar de una manera distinta y creo que se not porque en cada pelota fuimos a trabar como si fuese la ultima
5877414 entendimos el mensaje hablamos durante la semana de que deb amos salir con otra actitud y creo que se not porque en cada pelota fuimos a trabar como si fuese la ultima
5877415 fue un partido duro pero nos fuimos conformes con la actitud que demostr el equipo
5877416 si hab a un ganador tendr a que haber sido los andes
5877417 ellos vinieron hacer un planteo muy mezquino nos llegaron dos veces con pelota parada
5877418 con mariano nos conocemos bien con l no jugamos nunca de centrales juntos pero estaba al lado m o cuando era tres en el campeonato pasado
5877419 yo soy un jugador que por ah me agarra la locura risas voy a apretar adelante y l me cubre los espacios
5877420 the mystics have not moved one ounce in their 11 year history and weve got to start making some changes it is the only way this team is going to survive
5877421 in my 34 years in politics i never met a more dishonest person than george zoffinger
5877422 george swore he wouldnt do it again then hed do it again
5877423 george works the media he knows when he casts the only negative vote he becomes the story
5877424 there is a signed agreement somewhere and they havent found it
5877425 greg schiano in my opinion will go to penn state in a heartbeat
5877426 this is the meeting that talks about cutting edge military trauma medicine
5877427 attendees can get the latest ideas and medical inventions here things that change the future most of the key players in the field come here
5877428 its a way to bring the battlefield to the scientists
5877429 this is increasingly becoming the forum for new clinical systems and performance
5877430 it facilitates focusing our research into areas where the u s isnt doing research
5877431 coming here helps us decide where to get greater money for our own research
5877432 the single most valuable thing that comes out of the combat casualty care meeting held each year is that it brings together u s and international expertise
5877433 an example is addressing the plan for improved training and how the army in particular is going to ensure competence in the future
5877434 as the exceptional training goes away its vitally important to sustain their professional abilities
5877435 were building a crescendo of results of saving lives and reducing morbidity
5877436 combat casualty care will continue to push the envelope of saving lives
5877437 theres a dramatic decrease in mortality from previous wars because of the advancements made in trauma care
5877438 the key has been those medics those doctors and medical teams doing what they do in horrible conditions
5877439 make it more darker and not commerciallize sic just like the dark knight the writer and the director make some risk to the movie and look what happen
5877440 i had never heard of this girl before but seeing her celebrate after winning her silver i now love her
5877441 if you are not gay a man should not be wearing pink saying pink is a form of red is the same as saying homosexual is a form of male
5877442 because homosexual is clearly a flavour of delicious ice cream now serve me up soma dat mmm hmm chile
5877443 to come to the conclusion that i am homophobic from these sentences is far from the truth
5877444 some of my friends and colleagues are gay and if i was truly homophobic then i have picked the wrong industry
5877445 one day in prayer all by myself i asked myself the question what if its all not true
5877446 it was an earth shaking moment of spiritual terror such a profound experience it was such a sense of loss i felt my faith leaving me and never coming back
5877447 it quickly got completely out of my control now no one wants to call themselves a mormon filmmaker because youre associating yourself with a genre thats fallen into disrepute its like having porn on your r sum
5877448 one day in prayer all by myself i asked myself the question what if its all not true dutcher recalled
5877449 one day in prayer all by myself i asked myself the question what if its all not true
5877450 you are going to have to think of something else to say because that is just not helping me
5877451 i am buying you a spa treatment and whatever you want
5877452 i remember when i first got an e mail saying that the children of this wellington neighborhood wanted to hold a fundraiser to sponsor our we care packages by having a neighborhood lemonade stand
5877453 these children are truly setting an example to the american public and their humanitarian spirit is certainly a reflection on their parents and their upbringing
5877454 i truly hope that this sets a precedent for others in our community and throughout our country
5877455 we had donations from sheriffs that drove by dog walkers joggers landscapers and various service companies
5877456 we pride ourselves in arizona of being a statewide network that can assist with any type of emergency
5877457 this includes the federal county and state assets that are all working diligently to make sure the people of northern arizona are safe
5877458 i never want to live in a vegetative state dependent on some machine and fluids from a bottle if that ever happens just pull the plug
5877459 obviously well evaluate him every day he gets in here and see how his knee is holding up
5877460 theres still internal discussions about what were going to do and i should have something for you before we go to baltimore
5877461 we have to wait and see how some things come out and then ill give it to you on thursday
5877462 it feels a lot better than it has which is a good sign its coming out good the more i play catch the better it feels
5877463 its very rare that you get the opportunity to add a pitcher like greg even one time let alone twice
5877464 hes one of the greatest pitchers of all time and weve already seen what he can add to a team both on the field and in the clubhouse
5877465 going to smash my camera with a ball peen hammer
5877466 please keep this going so everyone can see what we are made of in this country
5877467 also think about this if you dont want to forward this for fear of offending someone you are part of the problem
5877468 im thinking of forwarding this email of mine a casting notice that isnt quite right for me but maybe mom would be interested or could forward it to her friends
5877469 make me the ugliest leotards possible i want shiny bunchy unflattering material make it look like cheap christmas wrap next add random squiggles sequins and rick rack bottom line i want something that can make even an 87 pound gymnast look chunky do it now
5877470 this is a chance for people in our region to promote local produce and for the first time local wine can complement local meals
5877471 in the light of continuing cost shifting from state to local government it is only appropriate that the iemma government steps in and guarantees the safety of ses volunteers
5877472 these ses volunteers put their life on the line in times of crisis and deserve a safe working environment
5877473 the nsw labor government has to realise that this state extends beyond the great dividing range
5877474 they need to step up to the mark and assist rural and regional councils in providing modern safe working environments for emergency service volunteers
5877475 the nsw labor government never seems to have any difficulty coming up with millions of dollars to employ sydney spin doctors but never seem to find the energy commitment or funds for vital local rural infrastructure
5877476 the state emergency service performs a vital role for the community particularly in rural regional areas
5877477 when we approached the house people where out the front and i was scared as to what was going on i didnt want to get out of the car
5877478 they replaced the dead grass with astro turf and it just looks great
5877479 the internet is one of the most powerful low cost mediums for promoting tourism destinations and cabonne country offers many unique experiences from bushwalking to fine dining hot air balloon rides to wine tasting the shire is so diverse and having a tourism website is a great opportunity to show the world what cabonne has on offer
5877480 tourism is very important for regional areas such as cabonne and the website will be able to reach out to many people planning a weekend break or extended holiday
5877481 take it off dont you remember 1968 you are a child why do you do that the soviets are here they will shoot again
5877482 a noruega por exemplo tem uma esp cie de fundo de pens o que pega toda a receita de petr leo e aplica no exterior
5877483 o governo ainda n o tem uma decis o estamos apenas estudando e temos ainda seis ou oito reuni es para fazer
5877484 if you vote for this youll be voting for a monopoly
5877485 i feel so sorry for him that woman tempted him
5877486 and you know she has terminal cancer so shes probably not meeting his needs either
5877487 i treat this matter delicately because this person needs privacy
5877488 there is not a single public health crisis in the history of mankind that has been solved by handing out brochures
5877489 a lot of the procedural issues necessary for instant replay to be implemented need to be worked out
5877490 major league baseball needs to step up to the plate and iron out these issues
5877491 im not going to go through these one by one i will tell you that on a number of them the comments are simply not accurate
5877492 for example weve had an understanding with the wua for some time that the crew chief and the crew chief only would be the one responsible for reviewing the video and making the decision on instant replay

5877496 this could create a laurel and hardy effect and may cause delay of game problems
5877497 he doesnt trust the teams to behave themselves in their absence
5877498 the umpires raised concerns and brought potential problems to solomons attention at least six weeks ago
5877499 it wasnt as bad as i thought it would be
5877500 im not much of a small talker and i dont think she is either i was a little nervous because i hadnt seen or talked to her in 14 years
5877501 everyone was making it out to be such a big deal that i think we both fell prey to having that affect us
5877502 i know shannen probably doesnt share the feelings that i have for tori but i love tori like my sister
5877503 i didnt want to go back to the doctors every four months for testing and squishing and everything i just wanted to kind of be rid of this whole thing for me this was the choice that i made and it was a tough one
5877504 by coming out and cutting it out she snuffed out cancer and the rumor mills at the same time shes nobodys bitch
5877505 she said shes starting a program to help women at high risk for breast cancer to meet the costs of an mri which is not always covered by insurance
5877506 the turnaround notice gave lawrence gordon productions the perpetual right
5877507 warner bros production and anticipated release of the watchmen sic motion picture violates 20th century foxs long standing motion picture rights in the watchmen property
5877508 we will be asking the court to enforce foxs copyright interests in the watchmen and enjoin the release of the warner bros film and any related watchmen media that violate our copyright interests in that property
5877509 dont expect them to go away for anything less than 25 million and they will take an amount like that now because they dont want to gamble either 100 of wbs profit could be 0
5877510 then how did you know how to make these they are fantastic
5877511 email spam 22 770 000 and the plain variety just
5877512 i dont think it would be productive for our football team you have to be a productive part to be an nfl player and theres responsibilities to being an nfl player its a privilege its not a right theres a lot that comes with being an nfl football player
5877513 the bengals tried for an extended period of time to support chris and his potentially bright career we had hoped to guide him toward an appropriate standard of personal responsibility that this community would support and that would allow him to play in the nfl but those efforts end today as we move on with what is best for our team
5877514 im just glad theyre willing to let the past be the past and give him a chance
5877515 i just hope that the cincinnati fans will give him the same type of chance
5877516 no se salvan almas que han decido morir por si mismas

5877526 probably the biggest lie told in schools though is that the way to succeed is through following the rules
5877527 lo que importa no es cuanta gente te lee ni cuantos comentarios quedan en cada post lo que realmente importa es cuanto de uno mismo se puede dejar en cada uno de esos escritos
5877528 im pleased to see some of you with very solid focus here today
5877529 i know this subject can be hard and some of you are clearly frustrated but are keeping at it anyway and so special kudos to you
5877530 for those of you who have never done this before thank you for giving me and this subject your time and attention and willingness
5877531 barry wonders why you think your kid is the cutest in the world when clearly his kid is the cutest
5877532 i think the semi final shows that fila wrestlings governing body does not play fair i didnt deserve to lose
5877533 theres so much emotion going through my head and so much excitement i kind of just want to see my mom
5877534 the beijing olympics has witnessed the greatest olympian of all time michael phelps of the usa
5877535 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
5877536 if you can handle eight gold medals you can handle anything
5877537 this will help in mitigating the global food crisis we are sure that it will work wonders
5877538 it will save half our grain and will also reduce villagers dependence on food stock
5877539 the only issue is how people react to rat meat but i think it will not be a problem
5877540 some socially deprived people in bihar have always consumed rat meat if they can eat rats why cant the rest of the people
5877541 there are many young strong single people in the athletes village and like everywhere some will fall in love or other things so we need to make condoms available
5877542 a lot of these young people are not married or in relationships so we want to make sure they have the information and tools to protect themselves if they have sexual encounters
5877543 we have people here from all religions and cultural backgrounds some of whom may feel uncomfortable or offended with condoms in their room
5877544 no one can see that you are carrying condoms to save any embarrassment
5877545 people are encouraged to take the leaflets and to take as many as they like they can use them or take them home for friends and spread the knowledge and awareness
5877546 im not a huge fan of people pranking me back so i just like to watch and get a good laugh
5877547 his physical abilities are unbelievable he has great leadership he obviously is explosive hes fast hes unbelievably strong
5877548 we look at it as an opportunity to get better to learn from james
5877549 he said i swear if one more little kid comes up to me and says james can i get your autograph
5877550 when you have such a great linebacker like james its tough to be in that spotlight but at the same time you get an opportunity that a lot of people want to see him play and youre able to showcase your talent
5877551 theres a lot of pros but i dont see too many cons if youre eager for that spotlight then maybe youre not happy but the good thing about us linebackers were not selfish guys
5877552 austin doesnt forget thats the thing it might take him a couple of days a couple of weeks youll hear him complaining but something is going to happen
5877553 anything bad that happens to him he thinks its me
5877554 maybe some times i get him but that was not one of my pranks
5877555 if youre a hard worker and you do the right things i think its bound to happen sometime
5877556 you may recognize her as the volta voices cover model from several months ago hard to believe it looking at her now but shes the little baby playing the drum
5877557 epilogue when i am old and grey and full of tears
5877558 her cantonese mother hollered from the end of the long hallway the shrill sound carrying through four walls and a tightly shut door
5877559 her mother ordered the flip flop slippers that she always wore slapping against the soles of her feet in the familiar staccato of agitated movement as she went on to wake amandas brat of a little brother
5877560 i clean and cook all day long and you dont even care
5877561 and i did have a date thank you very much but i actually behaved he was a perfect gentleman
5877562 yeah well i wish my dad could have been the same
5877563 weve known each other since we were in diapers just because
5877564 alright i wont and im not ashamed of who i am so dont start on that but all this drama between you and your parents its not healthy for you
5877565 but whats drama without having your own mother accuse you of being a slut right in the middle of the restaurant
5877566 oh yeah but shes convinced that im lying to cover up the fact that were sleeping together simply because were living together mind you oh and apparently you and i are wallowing in sin and you especially will burn in hell for making me tell my parents such horrible lies
5877567 i think so anyway i stopped listening half way through when she switched to cantonese
5877568 i think it was more out of disbelieving shock than anything else
5877569 because i look normal and i dont have a sign on my forehead that says im gay flashing in neon letters
5877570 your parents are about as old fashioned as mine howd you keep them from flipping out or better yet disowning you
5877571 i think it was because of the accident theyre just happy im alive and not some smear on the road
5877572 plus having three other brothers to carry on the family name helps too
5877573 you could learn a few things amda its not hard to keep your parents happy just give them face and pretend youre listening to them
5877574 but you dont see my parents flipping out and my dads more dai lam yun than yours
5877575 youre practically my brother i dont need to hear or envision the details of your sex life
5877576 just for that you owe me a movie whats playing
5877577 you werent the one who got your ankles clawed off because you wanted to take a shower first thing in the morning not knowing that the psycho kitty was sitting in the bathtub
5877578 its not your fault your mommy is so damn grouchy
5877579 if you lose any more hair youre going to have bald spots
5877580 sometimes mah makes me feel like id be better off dead
5877581 and sometimes sometimes i have to wonder if she would be right
5877582 i feel unwanted is it wrong to want someone to need me like they loved me
5877583 i just want to find someone who will love me for me i want to find someone who will

5877588 mamee dont have to be respectful you are my daughter mamee deserve your respect because i am your mother
5877589 respect isnt something anyone gets just by thinking they deserve it respect is something you have to earn mother or not
5877590 ive tried to respect you mah but i cant when you say such hurtful things to me
5877591 shouldnt have given the necklace to such ungrateful daughter like you you are such disappointment to mamee sometimes mamee wonder if it would be better if you were dead

5877609 to say that were not a media company would be hypocrisy
5877610 kita saling berbagi pendapat bertukar ide dan wawasan pengetahuan ilmu dan pemahaman
5877611 dan janganlah kamu berdebat untuk membela orang orang yang mengkhianati dirinya sesungguhnya allah tidak menyukai orang orang yang selalu berkhianat lagi bergelimang dosa
5877612 beginilah kalian kamu sekalian adalah orang orang yang berdebat untuk membela mereka dalam kehidupan dunia ini maka siapakah yang akan mendebat allah untuk membela mereka pada hari kiamat atau siapakah yang jadi pelindung mereka terhadap siksa allah
5877613 di antara manusia ada orang yang mendebat tentang allah tanpa ilmu pengetahuan dan mengikuti setiap syaitan yang sangat jahat
5877614 dan di antara manusia ada orang orang yang mendebat tentang allah tanpa ilmu pengetahuan tanpa petunjuk dan tanpa kitab wahyu yang bercahaya
5877615 tidakkah kamu perhatikan sesungguhnya allah telah menundukkan untuk kepentingan mu apa yang di langit dan apa yang di bumi dan menyempurnakan untukmu ni mat nya lahir dan batin dan di antara manusia ada yang mendebat tentang keesaan allah tanpa ilmu pengetahuan atau petunjuk dan tanpa kitab yang memberi penerangan
5877616 tidak ada yang memperdebatkan tentang ayat ayat allah kecuali orang orang yang kafir
5877617 dan supaya orang orang yang mendebat ayat ayat kekuasaan kami mengetahui bahwa mereka sekali kali tidak akan memperoleh jalan ke luar dari siksaan
5877618 dan di antara mereka ada orang yang mendengarkan bacaan mu padahal kami telah meletakkan tutupan di atas hati mereka sehingga mereka tidak memahaminya dan kami letakkan sumbatan di telinganya
5877619 dan janganlah kamu memakan binatang binatang yang tidak disebut nama allah ketika menyembelihnya sesungguhnya perbuatan yang semacam itu adalah suatu kefasikan sesungguhnya syaitan itu membisikkan kepada kawan kawannya agar mereka mendebat kamu dan jika kamu menuruti mereka sesungguhnya kamu tentulah menjadi orang orang yang musyrik
5877620 musim haji adalah beberapa bulan yang dimaklumi barangsiapa yang menetapkan niatnya dalam bulan itu akan mengerjakan haji maka tidak boleh rafats berbuat fasik dan berdebat pada waktu mengerjakan haji
5877621 sungguh allah telah mendengar perkataan seorang wanita yang meminta pendapatmu mengenai suaminya dan mengeluhkan nya kepada allah dan allah mendengar perbincangan keduanya sesungguhnya allah maha mendengar dan maha melihat
5877622 muhammad itu rasulullah dan orang orang yang bersamanya yaitu para sahabat ra adalah orang orang yang sangat tegas terhadap orang orang kafir dan sangat lemah lembut kepada sesama mereka
5877623 long half life results in a very stable subjective experience
5877624 tolerance occurs very rapidly i would expect tolerance also to the analgesic effects so theoretically it should not be a good pain drug because the rapid tolerance would eliminate the analgesic effect after a few days
5877625 in reality though patients will claim relief from suboxone for an indefinite period of time in many cases
5877626 suboxone certainly has advantages over other opiates if it is found to be effective the tolerance with buprenorphine is limited whereas the tolerance to a pure agonist has not limit so there is a lower amount of withdrawal if when the drug is eventually discontinued the stable blood level prevents the temporary highs the miserable lows and the cravings that can accompany the use of agonists the patient feels much more clear headed on suboxone compared to opiate agonists and suboxone can be dosed once per day which has a couple effects first it just is less trouble to take but more importantly the absence of as needed dosing all day long will help prevent the patient from focusing as much on the pain
5877627 many people have told me that suboxone seems to work as a mood stabilizer
5877628 chronic pain is a very difficult issue i encourage you to avoid opiates as much as possible there is generally little future in opiate treatment of pain since tolerance always chips away at the effects of the opiate over time

5877648 een kwartier van te voren zat ik met die redacteur te babbelen in de studio toen zei hij dat hij even moest bellen achteraf blijkt dat hij naar danny aan het bellen was daarnaast mocht ik het filmpje dat ze gemaakt hadden ook niet zien omdat het zogenaamd nog niet gemonteerd was achteraf blijkt dus dat ik gewoon naar de slachtbank werd gevoerd

5877666 eleven years after labour came to power almost two million children have left school without any good gcse passes
5877667 the problems with educational underachievement are concentrated in the poorest areas of the country it is in those areas that our policies for a swedish model of school reform to create thousands more good new school places can make the most difference only then will children from disadvantaged families start to get the same kind of opportunity as others
5877668 record investment and schools hard work have transformed the lives and prospects of millions of young people since 1997 the number of schools where less than 25 of pupils gain five good gcses has dropped from 616 to 17 a 36 fold reduction
5877669 and standards are also rising in higher attaining schools the number of secondary schools where 70 or more pupils gain five good gcses has risen eleven fold to 891 up from 83 in 1997 we are now putting 400 million of extra money into schools with the lowest gcse results
5877670 there has been an impressive increase in recycling of domestic waste in the last few years but that only represents a tiny fraction of all waste generated in the uk
5877671 it is time for the government to move its priorities from household waste to the far greater problem of industrial and commercial waste
5877672 we would also like to see the vat regime reformed so that products that have a long life cycle or can be easily and cheaply repaired rather than replaced are made economically more attractive
5877673 this would be an important step in turning away from the throwaway culture we currently have
5877674 it is unacceptable that children have the odds stacked against them simply by default of having poorer parents the government must put its money where its mouth is and end child poverty so that all children no matter their background have equal chances to achieve a decent education
5877675 there has been an enormous programme of social reform over the past 10 years that has lifted 600 000 children out of poverty we are committed to accelerating this and to do this we are narrowing the gap in educational achievement between children from deprived backgrounds and those who are better off

5877680 feminism is the theory that men and women are equal in every respect except for those in which women are superior the trick is to interpret every social indicator as though it demonstrates arbitrary male privilege or genuine female superiority fortunately a little bit of ignorance is all it takes to accomplish this feat
5877681 equality is an elusive concept but men and women will get along a lot better when women cease to be encouraged to tout every tendentious social indicator as a sign of their oppression

5877885 the truth has a great capacity to offend and injure and you will find that the closer you are to someone the more care you must take to disguise or even conceal the truth often there is great virtue in being evasive or equivocating there is also great skill any child can blurt out the truth without thought to the consequences it takes great maturity to appreciate the value of silence
5877886 one does not have to be evil to be hated in fact its often the case that one is hated precisely because one is trying to do right by ones own convictions it is far too easy to be liked one merely has to be accommodating and hold no strong convictions then one will gravitate towards the centre and settle into the average that cannot be your role there are a great many bad people in the world and if you are not offending them you must be bad yourself popularity is a sure sign that you are doing something wrong
5877887 the other side of the coin is this fall in love i didnt say be loved that requires too much compromise if one changes ones looks personality and values one can be loved by anyone rather i exhort you to love another human being it may seem odd for me to tell you this you may expect it to happen naturally without deliberation that is false modern society is anti love weve taken a microscope to everyone to bring out their flaws and shortcomings it far easier to find a reason not to love someone than otherwise rejection requires only one reason love requires complete acceptance it is hard work the only kind of work that i find palatable you will find that when you have someone to love that the face is less important than the brain and the body is less important than the heart you will also find that it is no great tragedy if your love is not reciprocated you are not doing it to be loved back its value is to inspire you finally you will find that there is no half measure when it comes to loving someone you either dont or you do with every cell in your body completely and utterly without reservation or apology it consumes you and you are reborn all the better for it

5877908 day after day every priest stands and performs his religious duties again and again he offers the same sacrifices which can never take away sins
5877909 therefore if anyone is in christ he is a new creation the old has gone the new has come all this is from god who reconciled us to himself through christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation that god was reconciling the world to himself in christ not counting mens sins against them
5877910 if we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth no sacrifice for sins is left but only a fearful expectation of judgment and of raging fire that will consume the enemies of god anyone who rejected the law of moses died without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses how much more severely do you think a man deserves to be punished who has trampled the son of god under foot who has treated as an unholy thing the blood of the covenant that sanctified him and who has insulted the spirit of grace

5877912 see if you put yourselves under the law and obey its edicts you will not be in danger of losing your salvation
5877913 but now a righteousness from god apart from law has been made known to which the law and the prophets testify this righteousness from god comes through faith in jesus christ to all who believe there is no difference for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by christ jesus god presented him as a sacrifice of atonement through faith in his blood he did this to demonstrate his justice because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished he did it to demonstrate his justice at the present time so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in jesus where then is boasting it is excluded on what principle on that of observing the law no but on that of faith for we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from observing the law is god the god of jews only is he not the god of gentiles too yes of gentiles too since there is only one god who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through that same faith do we then nullify the law by this faith not at all rather we uphold the law
5877914 see we arent supposed to nullify the law were supposed to uphold it
5877915 i have made past tense you a father of many nations

5878181 bagiku toloh fahri itu justru masih kurang sempurna harus aku sempurnakan lagi dia harus lebih berjiwa malaikat ketimbang yang sudah ada kupikir orang2 kita bangsa indonesia ini menilai fahri terlalu sempurna karena selama ini mereka tidak pernah disuguhi bacaan dan tontonan dengan kualitas seperti fahri orang2 kita selalu dicekoki tokoh tokoh jahat saja dan tidak diberi perimbangannnya yah kek sinetron2 itu laaah dan secara tak langsung mereka termakan dengan cekokan itu sehingga seolah olah dibenak mereka tidak ada lagi orang baik di dunia ini kalo ada yang baik sedikit saja dianggap aneh tidak hanya aneh tapi malah dianggap sok suci dan munafik ada orang tidak pacaran dinilai sok suci dan munafik ada kiai berfatwa benar dinilai sok alim inilah kualitas bangsa kita saat ini aku sangat prihatin kalo memikirkannya

5878271 leonardo avrebbe voluto rivaleggiar con la natura recreando un nuevo essere
5878272 su notoria incapacidad para finalizar las pinturas fue la consecuencia de una pr ctica art stica
5878273 pero el mejor de todos ellos fue rafael de urbino quien estudiando a los maestros de la antig edad como a los modernos extrajo lo mejor de cada uno y enriqueci el arte de la pintura con esa absoluta perfecci n que pose an las figuras de apeles y de zeuxis y m s a n si se me permite su colorido venci al de la misma naturaleza
5878274 cuando esta lucha alcanza a terminar con la primera ya la muerte es superada por una nueva existencia
5878275 oh maravillosa ciencia tu atesoras la transitoria belleza de los mortales que de este modo perduran m s que las obras de la naturaleza que son continuamente modificadas por el tiempo y empujadas a la senectud final
5878276 la pintura es inimitable porque hacer una pintura no es solo copiar la naturaleza sino conocer sus leyes internalizarlas conocer la norma ser lo que
5878277 vi la circulaci n de mi oscura sangre vi el engranaje del amor y la modificaci n de la muerte vi el aleph desde todos los puntos vi en el aleph la tierra y en la tierra otra vez el aleph y en el aleph la tierra vi mi cara y mis v sceras vi tu cara y sent v rtigo y llor porque mis ojos hab an visto ese objeto secreto y conjetural cuyo nombre usurpan los hombres pero que ning n hombre ha mirado el inconcebible universo
5878278 las ciencias imitables son de condici n tal que el disc pulo puede imitar al maestro y obtener de este modo similares frutos
5878279 his notorious inability to finish paintings was the consequence of an artistic practice that strove to make the work of painting embody the infinitely subtle working by which nature makes itself manifested to the senses in other words his technique embodied the principle of infinity to such an extent as to make it impossible to establish when a painting could be called finished sfumato thus radically dissociated painting from the work of the painter and gave to painting the status of an autonomous creation
5878280 la obligaci n y gratitud que los artistas pintores tienen ahora hacia la naturaleza que constantemente sirve de ejemplo a los que se ingenian en copiarla e imitarla en sus manifestaciones mejores y m s bellas se debe en mi opini n a giotto pintor florentino el solo aunque nacido y formado entre artistas ineptos por la gracia de dios fue capaz de resucitar el buen arte pict rico que se hab a extraviado y elevado a tal grado que se puede estimar como bueno
5878281 ninguna investigaci n humana puede recibir el nombre de ciencia sin pasar antes por demostraciones matem ticas
5878282 al g nero humano nunca lleg ni llegar un don divino mejor que ste
5878283 dado que la pintura depende del sentido de la vista el objetivo de la pintura es comunicable a todas las almas del universo pues el sentido de la vista tiene un camino hasta el sentido com n que es distinto del o do en virtud del cual la pintura no necesita de interpretes de las distintas lenguas como si lo necesitan las letras
5878284 se te gastar la pluma antes de que puedas describir plenamente lo que el pintor puede demostrar en el acto por medio de su ciencia antes de que puedas describir con palabras lo que un pintor puede ense arte en pintura
5878285 el pintor se ocupa de representar lo que se puede ver
5878286 es como el espejo el pintor que copia tan s lo a m rito de pr ctica y buen ojo ya que refleja en s las cosas que observa pero no tiene cabal conocimiento de ellas
5878287 el movimiento es el sue o del cambio en lo inm vil
5878288 luego en la historia me gusta que halla alguien que indique al espectador lo que sucede y ya sea que se ale con su mano lo que se debe observar o que con una explosi n feroz o una mirada amenazante invite a no acercarse m s como si quisiera que su asunto permaneciera oculto o que apunta hacia un peligro o cosa maravillosa en la pintura
5878289 la pintura abarca todas las formas de la naturaleza en s misma
5878290 si mi intelecto no alcanza a completar lo que era digno de m rito intentar deber n recordar que en los asuntos de importancia considerable el mero deseo de alcanzar lo que era m s dificil es considerado digno de elogio probablemente habr quien despu s de m venga

5878293 its a big problem actually we have people who will get so wasted and out of control and maybe if the age was lowered they wouldnt be so apt to do that
5878294 colleges by themselves can not address alcohol abuse among young adults its a community issue so by changing the focus to when should kids should start to drink really helps get the community get involved
5878295 its probably a good idea a better idea than 21 right now
5878296 maybe it would prevent like big parties the big weekend parties where everyone gets trashed because then maybe they could have a drink or two on a regular basis instead
5878297 we tried having 18 be the legal drinking age in the late 70s and early 80s and lowering the drinking age and people in the age group between 18 to 20 were dying on our roads in record numbers
5878298 as soon as the legal drinking age was changed back to 21 fatalities on our highways for 18 to 21 year olds dropped by 13 percent almost immediately
5878299 the amethyst initiative is not about lowering the drinking age we need serious sustained unfettered debate about the drinking age and the reality of life on a college campus and how these two things are aligned i signed the statement in hopes that it would encourage debate on our campus about the seriousness of drinking in general but more importantly the high risk drinking that has become so common on college campuses today as an educator i feel a responsibility to encourage a discussion about responsibility that responsibility rests with not only the students but with those of us who work to provide for their education safety and well being we must engage in civil informed and dispassionate debate and consider all policy alternatives no matter how controversial

5878538 private messages and to do lists were a godsend for one client this was a particularly challenging project for an extremely difficult client private messaging in basecamp gives us control of our clients perception of their project while still allowing us to be explicit with its nitty gritty parts all in one convenient place sometimes the work gets a little ugly but keeping a professional facade is extremely important to some clients basecamp accommodates this nicely

5878571 entrando ltimo matt ten a toda la presi n encima pero la manej brillantemente para alguien tan j ven estamos muy contentos
5878572 definitivamente era necesario tener un caballo con buena vista en esta pista
5878573 hay que montar la primera parte como si fuera un obst culo aislado y despu s empujar hacia los otros dos elementos si se entra muy fuerte alguna parte del obst culo se caer el recorrido es muy t cnico y liviano hay que concentrarse todo el camino
5878574 no es que no estemos acostumbrados a la presi n simplemente estamos muy sorprendidos hoy
5878575 ten amos el plan de usar la primera competencia para entrenar un poco el otro d a no es que no lo tom ramos en serio pero tal vez no lo hicimos bien vamos a tener que sentarnos y conversar sobre lo que ha ocurrido seguramente no es lo que esper bamos
5878576 bien armado pero cuando lo camin pens que el 50 de los caballos caer an en el agua hay una vuelta de casi 90 grados y a la combinaci n triple al final hab a que entrar muy corto s lo hemos visto un recorrido sin faltas hasta ahora es una pista buena y justa pero tendremos que prepararnos para la segunda ronda ma ana si es que entramos en los primeros ocho hoy si lo logramos no nos entregaremos vamos a salir peleando
5878577 no est f cil s lo hubo dos ceros hasta ahora pero hemos estado trabajando para esto por m s de un a o con un gran equipo de respaldo hemos sacrificado mucho y nos decepcionar a mucho volver a casa sin una medalla el secreto de los juegos ol mpicos es estar en el mejor punto en el momento correcto sapphire estaba menos sensible hoy e hizo un gran trabajo
5878578 no estamos seguros qu es lo que le le pasa puede estar acalambrado pero no pod a saltar as john est muy decepcionado
5878579 nuestros dos primeros jinetes no tuvieron un buen d a hoy pero van a mejorar ma ana nos vemos en el podio
5878580 si le entra un insecto en la oreja enloquece y empieza a mover la cabeza y ni siquiera ve el obst culo
5878581 en realidad no hemos tenido una mala temporada para nada
5878582 fuimos segundos en la baule y segundos otra vez en st gallen y no siempre hemos podido usar nuestros mejores caballos y mejores jinetes pero hemos trabajado muy duro para prepararnos para venir ac
5878583 esta es una copa de naciones y cualquier cosa puede pasar y s lo estamos a la mitad del camino
5878584 estoy confiado en mi equipo pero ma ana es otro d a y otras pista hay que esperar y ver qu pasa
5878585 s tenemos que seguir trabajando tomando las cosas d a por d a
5878586 comenz el piaffe muy bien de modo que realmente me sorprendi porque no vi ninguna raz n para lo que pas
5878587 l es un poco genio y a veces peque as cosas lo perturban
5878588 y tenemos que recordar que estos son animales de modo que cualquier cosa puede pasar
5878589 fue una cosa tonta y nunca pas en el entrenamiento
5878590 a veces uno quiere hacer todo tan bien y uno est un poco tenso pero mi caballo est muy bien entrenado y en rgico y estaba tratando de hacer la mejor prueba y eso es positivo
5878591 para que d lo mejor de s no hay que ponerle ninguna presi n y esta noche estuvo realmente hacia adelante y con una excelente respuesta
5878592 hablamos en los establos sobre c mo har amos las cosas l habla alem n as que me entiende muy bien
5878593 gran parte de la prueba viene de su interior de su mente tanto como de su cuerpo no se puede conseguir nada presion ndolo
5878594 cuando sal de la entrega de premios el jueves por la noche pude sentir algo extra o en su forma de moverse pero despu s parec a estar ok estaba excitada en el rect ngulo con el ruido y todo lo dem s pero no recuerdo que haya pasado nada especial as que me sorprendi ayer la revisamos nuevamente y todav a hab a alg n problema es un su mano est desparejo el movimiento pero espero que se recupere r pidamente
5878595 hice la preparaci n con galera y chaqueta y creo que simplemente tuve un golpe de calor y no sab a bien lo que hac a en la pista
5878596 mi caballo es naturalmente extravagante y creo que hizo una muy linda prueba estoy feliz de volver al rect ngulo y tener una gran actuaci n fue bueno para m y para mi caballo
5878597 hoy ten a m s caballo que en el grand prix y me queda mucho caballo para el freestyle
5878598 es la peor nota que he obtenido con l tuve problemas con el contacto y cometimos muchos errores fue un mal d a para nosotros qu puedo decir
5878599 fue un esfuerzo conjunto del equipo trabajamos unos para otros y nos apoyamos unos a otros estoy realmente contenta y es muy emocionante porque mucha gente no cre a en nosotros despu s del campeonato europeo del a o pasado pero realmente probamos lo que somos hoy
5878600 no estoy satisfecha con el piaffe pero en general fue una buena actuaci n a pesar de peque os errores puede ser que me estaba esforzando por lograr demasiado y termin obteniendo menos mi primer error fue en el primer trote alargado
5878601 no s qu decir me siento muy mal s que acab con el equipo
5878602 fue terrible y cuando llegamos a las piruetas supe que est bamos en un muy mal d a brentina estaba muy diferente en la pista de calentamiento me tom por sorpresa
5878603 quer a hacer mucho m s pero ten a que actuar seguro para el equipo en el grand prix special y la kur puedo tomar riesgos ahora no era el momento
5878604 despu s de ayer nos olvidamos de la medalla de oro
5878605 los primeros dos resultados de holanda no fueron lo suficientemente buenos pero el sorteo tampoco ayud por otra parte deber amos haber tenido una actuaci n mejor y otro pa s estuvo mejor que nosotras no es el final de mi vida aunque estoy decepcionada
5878606 me estoy haciendo mayor y ya he sido consentida con dos caballos incre bles a menos que alguien me ofrezca otro caballo maravilloso no me veo yendo a londres
5878607 estoy muy satisfecha porque durante tres d as max tuvo una temperatura alta y tuve que esperar para ver como andaba sin embargo en los ltimos d as estuvo mejor y supe que pod a ser competitivo estuvo casi demasiado en rgico esta noche
5878608 su cr a es orlov trotter y lo monto hace seis a os
5878609 pienso que esta noche sintio que estaba haciendo control de multitudes nuevamente porque no quer a caminar y no dejaba de mirar a su alrededor pero luego se calm y estoy muy satisfecha de c mo actu
5878610 heike nos dio una base positiva para comenzar y luego nadine tambi n hizo una muy buena prueba de modo que sab a que lo importante era montar seguro y no pod a darme el lujo de cometer un error
5878611 entr con una buena sensaci n porque las otras amazonas hab an hecho un buen trabajo pero ten a mucha presi n porque el a o pasado perdimos el oro con holanda en los campeonatos europeos y sab a que era hora de despertarnos no nos gust
5878612 holanda y alemania son en realidad socios porque luchamos entre nosotros y eso agranda el deporte pero fuera del rect ngulo podemos tomarnos una copa de champagne juntos
5878613 me temo que la medalla de oro por equipos ya est decidida quer amos ganarles a los alemanes pero hoy vemos que va a ser muy dif cil tendremos suerte si conseguimos alguna medalla
5878614 si un caballo de cualquier equipo comete un error grave entonces el resultado queda muy abierto
5878615 el trote fue bueno y el pasaje muy bueno pero comet un error al galope cuando hice siete batidas en lugar de seis
5878616 antes de entrar estaba un poco tensa pero en el rect ngulo estaba estupenda no se dio por enterada de la pantalla ni de las c maras
5878617 definitivamente no fue mi mejor prueba el caballo no cometi ning n error importante pero tuvo equivocaciones menores
5878618 los otros jinetes tendr n que conseguir los mejores resultados de su vida para sacarme del pantano
5878619 ha tenido d as malos desde su llegada pero hoy no habr a podido pedir m s
5878620 he competido en dos finales de copa del mundo uno escucha nombres como kyra y anky y se pregunta que est haciendo ah pero ahora estoy en los juegos ol mpicos con ellas y espero poder montar bien
5878621 pero creo que mi caballo no disfrut el calor porque no estaba en rgica como de costumbre se pon a detr s de la embocadura y pas la lengua pero pude montarla durante el apoyo al galope despu s coloc la lengua bien pero me cost muchos puntos no tuve grandes errores excepto cuando pas la lengua las piruetas estuvieron realmente bien aunque pudo haber estado mejor en el pasaje
5878622 ha sido un mes maravilloso conociendo a la gente del equipo brit nico y la experiencia ol mpica ha sido muy especial
5878623 estuve en atenas con otro caballo pero result un desastre para m
5878624 luego en los juegos ecuestres fei en kentucky y en armar un buen equipo para las olimp adas de londres en 2012
5878625 siempre tuvo deseos de avanzar y eso ayud a que hiciera buenos cambios de pie en el aire
5878626 estoy acostumbrada siempre me mandan primero porque saben que tengo nervios de acero
5878627 si bonnie respira profundo despu s del alto y exhala ya se que va a estar bien s lo tengo que esperar a que exhale y arrancamos

5878682 fairy tales and the brothers grim at it again attitude
5878683 as a debt collector often youre trying to get someone to do something they dont want to do
5878684 people think debt collectors are making a living off others misfortune but companies are going bankrupt because people dont pay their bills
5878685 we used to do a lot of lock ups on mortgagees estates
5878686 debtors would try to refinance but couldnt so the bank would repossess the house and sell it as a mortgagee auction its one of the hardest things in the world to do literally going down there with a sheriff and a locksmith and locking them out of the house a couple of times there were parents and kids around its tragic

5878700 anyone with a basic education should understand that if you spend money you have to pay it back
5878701 sometimes you find people who dont understand interest rates or dont know theyre in as much trouble as they are thats when compassion comes into it you explain it to them
5878702 you just have to keep reminding yourself this person incurred a debt should the client just forgive the money thats owed to them theres got to be corporate awareness as well as social awareness

5878860 suddenly inflammation has become one of the hottest areas of medical research hardly a week goes by without the publication of yet another study uncovering a new way that chronic inflammation does harm to the body it destabilizes cholesterol deposits in the coronary arteries leading to heart attacks and potentially even strokes

5878889 this variability in testosterone levels was really a physiological curiosity until androgel was approved
5878890 now every time the testosterone level is below 300 the question of prescription is raised
5878891 frankly i dont know where that number comes from or how real it is

5878915 i dont get it you cant be a positive person all of the time how do you do it
5878916 each morning i wake up and say to myself jerry you have two choices today you can choose to be in a good mood or you can choose to be in a bad mood i choose to be in a good mood each time something bad happens i can choose to be a victim or i can choose to learn from it i choose to learn from it every time someone comes to me complaining i can choose to accept their complaining or i can point out the positive side of life i choose the positive side of life
5878917 life is all about choices when you cut away all the junk every situation is a choice you choose how you react to situations you choose how people will affect your mood you choose to be in a good mood or bad mood the bottom line its your choice how you live life
5878918 if i were any better id be twins wanna see my scars
5878919 the first thing that went through my mind was that i should have locked the back door
5878920 then as i lay on the floor i remembered that i had two choices i could choose to live or i could choose to die
5878921 the paramedics were great they kept telling me i was going to be fine but when they wheeled me into the emergency room and i saw the expressions on the faces of the doctors and nurses i got really scared in their eyes i read hes a dead man
5878922 well there was a big burly nurse shouting questions at me
5878923 nope we just pack our stuff up once or twice a week so see how many boxes it takes heres your sign

5878936 one of the biggest reasons i left elkton hills was because i was surrounded by phonies
5878937 is to countries what self respect is to individuals a necessary condition of self improvement

5878939 a refreshing way to look at making necessary changes in your life
5878940 make changes that will nourish your desire spark your enthusiasm provide sensitivity to realize your true gifts
5878941 well its not like kids drink the water or anything
5878942 when we bought this house we were to stay here for 10 years hopefully build enough equity with the improvement and sell it for a profit and hopefully have a little nest egg for retirement
5878943 they qualified me for the loan just by my credit score alone
5878944 the idea of going into foreclosure for me from a midwestern viewpoint is you just dont do that
5878945 i dont think ill ever have the possibility of owning a home down here again or anywhere else for that matter and at my age that is even more depressing because you know if i was my sons age it would be different you can recover you can build up again you can give it another shot but im at a point in my life where you dont get that many more shots
5878946 i never fathomed that we would find ourselves in this situation
5878947 the situation is either here or our van and we are a family of four and we cant very well stay in our van
5878948 any time between monday and friday nine to five is the most nerve racking because of course the city is open and operable
5878949 were liberating units were not stealing anything these places are locked up and enslaved and we are liberating them
5878950 i think the law while the law certainly has some value i think there are times when you cant obey the law if slavery were legal i think we would be obligated to disobey slavery now we have vacant housing while there are homeless people with children living on the street i think we have obligation to make those units available
5878951 we need to take back land we need to take back housing and we need to take control of our own destiny and our own situation
5878952 there are a lot of government entities that are set up and designed to help us but they dont really want to do that their hearts are not really there they are just there for a paycheck and we found that out the hard way
5878953 i tried to stay in south florida i dont think anyone i talked to really thought i was going to move
5878954 listen if you cant afford to live and you cant afford to pay your taxes and youre living week to week or less than week to week youre not happy you cant say this on camera but you walk somewhere and you say hi and they say an expletive they grumble but here you smile and everyone says hello
5878955 i think we are going to find it my wife is pregnant here we are going to have a boy in south carolina
5878956 and in our market the average priced home is around 186 187 thousand
5878957 it kind of started slowly and none of us realized it was happening until all of the sudden every broker that i know had people in their office out showing property to families from florida
5878958 they are leaving high cost regions and looking for reasonable cost regions
5878959 south florida has a real big issue whats going to be of it i dont know im not a fortune teller but i know i wasnt going to wait around to be a byproduct of what happened i am going to make my own destiny
5878960 i dont think the middle class can survive here your nurses and teachers and postal workers and all of our middle professional people who arent upper management its like we dont have an option
5878961 every day its getting worse every hour its getting worse its getting harder and harder for people to survive there are people who commit suicide over the same situation its just that serious
5878962 i stopped paying my mortgage in october after shelling out about 70 000 in interest over 15 months
5878963 the time it takes to regain your credit score after foreclosure can be shorter than after bankruptcy
5878964 if they have to stretch to make mortgage payments for a home that will not recover its value then yes they may walk away
5878965 that makes sense if people are choosing to walk away
5878966 weve needed an extra day now for a couple of months because it is already unmanageable with two days and we expect the caseload to increase further
5878967 itll make you nervous if youve ever gone to the bank to have a cashiers check made you might get there and theres 20 people in front of you
5878968 by the time youre out of there with your check youre stressed
5878969 the buyer today is more aware people buy with more ease they can plan long term
5878970 there are still plenty of points for evolution because theres still plenty of demand
5878971 mexico doesnt have a credit issue we can still choose our borrowers because demand is so great
5878972 i always had in my head that the only thing you can give your kids as inheritance is an education and a house
5878973 but a roof is the best its your world your home
5878974 im standing in my backyard right now looking in my neighbors house which is essentially the same
5878975 my neighbor pays about 8 000 in taxes and i pay 23 000 and its just not fair
5878976 the taxes that i pay on this house are larger than my social security which i worked my entire career to build up
5878977 im one of the guys in theory they were trying to protect a senior citizen on a fixed income and its eating me alive
5878978 the reason its ripe right now is because the discrepancy and disparity has increased over the years so that it has created real inequity among the citizens
5878979 the river has gotten too wide for the crossing and we need to find something that does provide equal protection and doesnt discriminate against how long youve been living here
5878980 its constitutional i listen to florida lawyers more than georgia lawyers
5878981 were changing the constitution how can it be more constitutional
5878982 the challenge isnt a state constitutional challenge its a federal constitutional challenge
5878983 the lawyer the state hired to advise them warned us not to do exactly what were doing
5878984 i was told no were not going to do it that way and the senate presidents and mostly the governors office said they are confident this version is constitutional

5879007 what i wanted to do for the rest of my life
5879008 i couldnt help but wonder how things might have been different had i been shown the way while i was still in junior high and high school it wasnt that i needed someone to tell me what to do but it wouldve helped to have been shown a few different options and been guided to ask myself some probing questions about what i wanted out of life

5879027 well ah ah i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective
5879028 answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
5879029 this is something that i have not i think come to a firm resolution on i think its very hard to know what that means when life begins is it when a cell separates is it when the soul stirs so i dont presume to know the answer to that question what i know as ive said before is that there is something extraordinarily powerful about potential life and that has a moral weight to it that we take into consideration when were having these debates
5879030 a leader that god has blessed us with at this time
5879031 he loved rhyme and verse at age seven he wrote an acrostic spelling out the letters of his name this acrostic not only showed his brilliance but also the strong calvinistic theology which was characteristic of his life

5879033 when does a baby become entitled to legal protection when does life begin
5879034 thats above my pay grade although i am pro choice i am not pro abortion
5879035 consistent with our position last year naral does not oppose passage of the born alive infants protection act floor debate served to clarify the bills intent and assure us that it is not targeted at roe v wade or a womans right to choose
5879036 i brought pictures in and presented them to the committee of very premature babies from my neonatal resuscitation book from the american pediatric association trying to show them unwanted babies were being cast aside babies the same age were being treated if they were wanted
5879037 doctors really dont care about children who are being born with a reasonable prospect of life because they are so locked into their pro abortion views that they would watch an infant that is viable die
5879038 that may be your assessment and i dont see any evidence of that what we are doing here is to create one more burden on a woman and i cant support that

5879441 walking is a great way to learn about a place to get around and to get some exercise when the weather is nice youll notice shops parks and public art that youve been accustomed to zooming past and come away feeling like youve really gotten the insiders take on a neighborhood or city of course dont get too caught up in enjoying the sights please be careful and be particularly attentive in high traffic areas just like if you were driving follow road signs and signals along your route and use good judgment about streets that cant be walked

5879444 the philanthropic dollars provide us the money to experiment and try new things
5879445 philanthropy can fail in a way that government cant but we can catalyze government investment in growing what works
5879446 there are a lot of people in this sector who will get nervous about the federal government becoming too engaged in philanthropy
5879447 but theres also this other argument that we dont want an agency that is going to over regulate us
5879448 look at whats in the inbox of the next president

5879540 its just fundamentally ineffective in terms of improving school discipline
5879541 it doesnt teach kids why what they did was wrong it doesnt show them better behavior what it does is teach them to be violent
5879542 i had a pretty good suspicion that people who were well motivated would do well with the technique but you have to be committed to learning it for it to benefit you i suspected most folks might not be that committed and so we might not show terribly much
5879543 this is a good large trial it is good enough evidence for people to take it seriously
5879544 but at the moment the alexander technique is not available on the nhs
5879545 the nursing staff had evaluated the patients nutrition the review revealed no nutritional consult was requested and revealed no evidence the physician was notified about the inadequate nutritional intake

5879547 they wouldnt let me see him i think he died that day
5879548 thats happened to me twice in my career and believe me its disappointing but wanting to come back for one play to me is obviously the wrong reason to come back or wanting to come back to prove someone wrong or wanting to come back from what happened this offseason
5879549 the only reason i came back was i wanted to play its as simple as that
5879550 believe me i wanted to win the game but i give them a tremendous amount of credit and respect
5879551 thats over and done with obviously its a new year and a lot of things have changed
5879552 im not thinking about the past theyre the team to beat in this league and were just trying to get better this week
5879553 with every preseason game ive played in id like to play the whole game
5879554 if im going to come out here and practice i want to play the whole game thats just my mentality will that happen no were going to be smart about it and whatever eric wants to do we havent really talked about it
5879555 for the most part its the things that people dont see that weve got to get on board with in a hurry
5879556 sight adjustments audibles things like that whats the easiest way for me to get to those is it using a term thats already in place or maybe coming up with a new term and not to mention changing it up and having more than one term for a lot of things i mean its a work in progress and i think thatll be the case all year long
5879557 in our 2 minute drill today we made some real good plays a lot of signals were given today some things that i had recommended maybe we try
5879558 we kind of just turned it loose today we did good on a couple and didnt do quite as well on the other ones the good thing is that it was practice we can go back and look at it on film and make the corrections
5879559 i said well theres no substitute for game type situations the 2 minute drills red zone situations third down situations you cant do them all in one day but were trying to throw those in
5879560 he wouldve wanted me to play all along and im sure it wouldve been in green bay but hed probably be out here at practice every day raising hell with me what i could be doing better he wouldve wanted me to play until my legs fell off thats just the way he was
5879561 the only reason i came back was i wanted to play its as simple as that
5879562 you have no good features no boobs no and not a good face im glad my ex and u broke up cause at least now hes getting some action

5879567 jimmy bond had a big jet boat chase in live and let die
5879568 i did quite a few run throughs to practice and whilst banking on one such run the engine cut out i had no steering i therefore continued in a straight line directly into a wooden boat house
5879569 there i was as a fearless 007 hobbling on a cane to my boat and then pretending to be indestructible for the cameras who says i cant act
5879570 he was a huge bond fan and said that he would love to direct one of the films
5879571 hed recently had great success with jaws and close encounters and was considered a very hot property i was rather excited at this news and went looking for film producer albert r cubby broccoli to tell him
5879572 do you know how much of a percentage hed want
5879573 its always been policy that no bond director ever got a slice of the box office profits

5879585 the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
5879586 but i have to say its not an example of putting country first when you say president george bushs economic policies have shown great progress
5879587 mr mccain let me explain to you the economic disaster is happening right now maybe you havent noticed
5879588 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time
5879589 i really wish i was going to college one more fricking year
5879590 i never felt like that when i lost a computer
5879591 mind control the full device has cables that lead to a pair of receptor dics that suction onto the sides of the head its is likely that the ability to determine non default destinations has to be approved by genetic matching before the device allows it if that is so then we have no way of using this the way the intruders do becos we do not even know what they are so we cannot even synthesise a match for the same species let alone for the individual this was taken from
5879592 how do u switch from the non default destination to the default one
5879593 i dont know i was only able to come here because this destination was already set
5879594 well that doesnt help me because ill only come right back here
5879595 no no you are not now listen to me ive allowed you your little reign over the criminals and the corrupt and ive done it at considerable risk to my own position and my freedom but dont imagine by any stretch that i would allow you to take the whole of svaasbaklor in your hands to play with this is not part of your private war
5879596 it was never a private war you pathetic ingrate it was for the sake of survival for the sake of history not repeating itself so wretches like you can move on from those wars in which we ripped ourselves apart wars which cost us how much did it take to come to where we are from where we were at the end of the last great war how much did it cost us to make this planet stop destroying itself
5879597 cost you i know what it cost you dont tell me it wasnt about that dont tell me it wasnt personal
5879598 if it was about her old friend it is you and all like you that i would be hunting down it wasnt the ones like him that killed her it was all of you and the only thing that saves your miserable hides is that she loved you all this shell of a planet is my only connection to all that was before the wars and that is why i will not allow a bunch of ha incompetents to play with its future im going you can try to stop me but we both know how that ends im going argon
5879599 if we cud only figure out how to switch the destinations
5879600 but i think every time a non default destination is set it can only be used once once used it expires and the only remaining destination is the default destination which should be the case now if im right and if im not then youll only wind up back here
5879601 we cud forego the receptors and plug it directly to my brain
5879602 it wud open the gateway but it wud kill you it wud channel every bit of energy away from your brain and into generating the gateway and effectively put your brain to sleep for that period with every chance of it not waking up again
5879603 well at least were not content to put our tails between our legs and wait for orders
5879604 i need some scalpels i hope you have a medikit in this place somewhere
5879605 yes well never thought id take any help from one of you either
5879606 nothing but if not for that then this story ends here doesnt it

5879625 i have decided that in the best interest of both uconn and myself that i will not play college basketball this year
5879626 both uconn and i require 100 percent dedication to the sport and as of now i feel i cannot give that level of commitment it therefore would be unfair to the excellent program coach geno auriemma the team and uconn fans for me to play
5879627 its the most bizarre thing i ever heard to have an opportunity like that to play obviously at the best college womens basketball program in the world and she threw it away
5879628 her skill levels were unmatched for anyone we had seen at the age
5879629 the only person to compare her with would be australias
5879630 athletically the two are comparable but heres the difference high school is about skill in college you have to have the passion and it appears to people she has lost that desire about the game furthermore once you get to the pros you also have to be nasty
5879631 even though many think she was capable of going straight to the wnba she doesnt seem to have that trait elena is basically a very nice kid
5879632 i have finished my first day as a junior high pastor

5879637 then your light shall break forth like the morning your healing shall spring forth speedily and your righteousness shall go before you the glory of the lord shall be your rear guard

5879663 our earth is deteriorating and as much as we try to convey the message were still going to be using our cars were still going to be wasting our energy by showing people this exhibit it will educate people about what we can do
5879664 one idea is to have a lot of murals and public art
5879665 we were working with artists who really believed that art could bring the community together we wanted to bring together different cultures through public art we set up an outdoor stage for performers
5879666 there was this one girl who was into bringing a lot of culture i was interested in bringing technology it was interesting bringing all these ideas into one plan

5879690 i am pleased to elevate beverly to associate head coach she has been an integral part of the carolina softball program over the last 10 years as my assistant as well as distinguishing herself as an outstanding softball player here
5879691 her recruiting efforts have helped us put together six ncaa appearances in the last seven years and under her direction our pitching staff had one of our most outstanding seasons to date last year
5879692 its going to be a little different setup for our fans so we felt the proper course of action was to temporarily suspend charging for admission to fetzer until we get a little cleaner access to the front entrance
5879693 fans may still enter the stadium through the traditional front gate as well as two other entrances
5879694 the carmichael renovation is a major construction project which requires us to make some changes but we are going to do everything we can to make certain that our fans have a safe and enjoyable experience when they come to our athletic events
5879695 our fans are important to our success and we want to thank them for their continued support
5879696 i couldnt get in the right formation for anything for about two weeks i couldnt line up right coach john shoop was always yelling at me i was called a line up guy because i could never get in the right spot
5879697 kentwan said coach john blake theres something wrong with your boy marvin last night i was asleep and i just heard him saying get them off me dog get them off me big boy i need your help he said i was getting deuce blocked in my sleep
5879698 he was coming up hard and i was trying to block him it was like boom i was like dang ive never had somebody that strong come at me before i was supposed to cut him hit him low so he could drop but for some reason didnt think i needed to i thought it was an option
5879699 but after the first time when he knocked me back they were like you can cut him i was like for real so the next play i cut him and he dropped
5879700 if t j yates is calling a play and im like okay i know it and i know exactly what to do i dont have to think i can just go out there and do my assignment instead of having to worry if what im doing is right
5879701 it was a point second or third game where i started to get comfortable out there at first it was new i was crawling out there and i felt myself starting to walk a little bit i got my confidence up and i saw that i can really make an impact in college football and i still feel that way
5879702 i was like virginia tech starting i had to get my mind right the whole week that was a big deal playing in front of all those people
5879703 after that i just started playing comfortable because after virginia tech they had so many people that were so loud i was like if i can play at virginia tech i can play anywhere
5879704 fall asleep for as many laps as you can and just give it a go
5879705 i just kept lapping people and i couldnt keep track of whos who
5879706 the mood will be a thousand percent better in the building on monday
5879707 it was pandemonium in the locker room its the springboard that helps you get into recruiting and get into the off season
5879708 the road to tampa bay only 680 miles to go
5879709 coach davis has spent a lot of time in the nfl
5879710 we say hey guys these are the guys that invented these routes this is how you do it i think we do a good job stimulating our players a pictures worth a thousand words they like that
5879711 one of our top goals during the off season was to become a smarter football team
5879712 i love doing it i watch film so much and i study the quarterback so much i understand where hes going i had pre game nerves a lot at the beginning of last year but the more i played and the more i studied film the more confident i became in what i was doing
5879713 we help each other from each side of the ball were trying to disguise the play and theyre trying to disguise the coverage i can help him with some of the little things were doing to catch them off guard
5879714 its exciting how much smarter football players we can be this year
5879715 i love country cooking fat back and fried food when id go home all my mom would do is cook and fill the table shes a great cook and she works at the perdue plant so shes strong with chicken
5879716 i didnt take it as seriously as i should have the last couple of years id go crazy at mcdonalds give me three double cheeseburgers something like that i knew what i was putting in my body but it tasted good but if i want to be a good football player ive got to make better choices the weight loss has made a difference especially in the pass rush im quicker and i can go longer and harder too
5879717 some places take 85 football players and say do this and everyone goes and runs five miles
5879718 here they do a great job of tweaking the program to each players needs i didnt run as much because they didnt want me burning as many calories i lifted twice a day sometimes to gain weight other guys were running a lot because they needed to lose
5879719 i was 225 pounds trying to block a 265 pound defensive end it was tough i got overpowered a lot now i know the defense better and ive learned how to use my feet and hands i know what to do and can take the right step and once i get there im not getting blown back i have some weight to stay in position and i finish with leg strength
5879720 every single kid can find a role if he gives great effort knows what to do and can be trusted
5879721 not every kid can be a starter but there is a niche for kids to feel they are significant contributors on game day
5879722 you can get a lot of measurements height weight 40 times but one thing you cannot measure that separates all running backs is vision
5879723 some kids have it some dont a kid can have 4 3 speed and the hole is supposed to be blocked here but it actually develops one gap wider the emmitt smiths and barry sanders just see that hit the new hole and have eight yards other guys dont get back to the line of scrimmage shawn has that
5879724 a lot of the things we ask him to do on special teams have a defensive nature
5879725 all of the drills that he does the open field tackling all the change of direction in space those are things that relate to playing linebacker
5879726 but i think playing defense and learning to play linebacker can help me from the special teams aspect
5879727 im learning to play in space and break on the ball to stay under control and make a tackle those things will help tremendously on punt and kick off coverage
5879728 its fun to be out there making plays and i always liked the offensive side of the ball i feel like ive found a home i just want to do anything i can to help us win the acc championship
5879729 every year ive been here except this year people have picked us second to last or dead last in the acc
5879730 this year its nice to see people excited about what were doing here and what were starting to put together over time its great what the media think about us and write about us but it all boils down to what we put on the field what we put on tape
5879731 the long grueling hours of timeless effort and sweat that that goes in before the start of the season is what people dont get to see
5879732 its easy to show up on saturdays with 65 000 people in the stands and the blimp in the air and the tv cameras its the guys that pay the price during april may june july that run in 95 degree heat and the only person driving them is themselves and their teammates
5879733 how could he do such a thing to a dying woman
5879734 hogans heroes with him to try to right a struggling company a clash of corporate cultures erupted
5879735 he did many important things many years ago cheryl lea hogan told me before her fathers memorial
5879736 we always talked about other things she said other things like poetry and astronomy and just the right recipe for pancakes or pumpkin pie yes c lester hogan was brilliant his only child said but he was also huggable
5879737 maybe the best measure of a man is the regard hes held in by his family and friends sanders told me by phone
5879738 we are pleased that the president and congress worked together to enact meaningful legislation that protects and enables families in this country to continue to strive for and enjoy the dream of homeownership
5879739 this federal housing package represents a significant move in the right direction for california homeowners
5879740 the measure will not only help thousands of borrowers facing financial trouble to stay in their homes but pave the way for thousands more to achieve the dream of becoming first time homeowners
5879741 the housing legislation will give the states housing market the shot in the arm it needs for recovery
5879742 the federal housing bill will provide stability in our economy and help boost home buyer confidence it will also help many deserving homeowners who are facing foreclosure keep their homes
5879743 as home prices have adjusted to more affordable levels buyers have just the limited period of time to take advantage of these incentives
5879744 in the middle of the week we actually had to cross a river
5879745 it wasnt that deep but it got us excited there was no other way or else we would have had to go through private property we had to cross the river somehow
5879746 horses are like kids they like to push their limits
5879747 but you need to show them whos boss because they are a lot bigger than you and can hurt you
5879748 if you dont show them whos boss they will ride you
5879749 its a beautiful building that reflects who we are and what we do
5879750 it used to be before when kids came up it looked like a school it wasnt a camp the new building reflects what were trying to do now we have this beautiful garden out in front and trees and you come in and it has this nice rustic feel to it
5879751 were just so proud of the whole project being completed its been a long road
5879752 the camp is here to immerse kids in the world of science and inspire environmental stewardship
5879753 our goal is to teach science and through that understanding of science they will then go back and be able to do good we cant really talk to them about global warming without seeing the effects of it
5879754 the walden west experience made me want to conserve more resources

5879761 he gave me this homework along with instructions to either find a restaurant where i could use the kitchen and their health permit for my cooking a co op kitchen or a kitchen to rent since i couldnt legally cook at home
5879762 i like to play with different types of materials pearls and stones and glass
5879763 we have quite a few painters two pottery artists photographers and some weavers
5879764 theres even a man who does sculptures out of recyclable materials los gatos has a nice reputation so the show has a nice variety of different things
5879765 none of the art is mass produced or manufactured and its all the artists own work we also like the fact that the artists are there
5879766 by keeping it small we keep the quality up the artists are reviewed very strongly
5879767 i cut the log in half and make a rough bowl and then i turn it and then i put it in the freezer
5879768 after i retired i wanted to get more involved in art
5879769 but i was no longer interested in working with clay a friend took me to a woodworking show in san mateo and introduced me to wood turning i was immediately hooked

5879772 were hoping to raise about 14 000 which is about 10 percent of our annual budget
5879773 the best part is just seeing the crowd enjoying the atmosphere looking at art listening to music and sipping wine

5879828 the charter should be taken to a forum for discussion because the conference is not the place for its discussion right now
5879829 i have not had a good look at the agenda but i believe it is part of the agenda proper next week
5879830 that is why we have a group that is well versed with all these issues in the church and would be making a presentation on the charter issue once it is discussed next week
5879831 and it shall not support a military government which believes in cleaning up thus tormenting the people since the december 2006 coup and by forcefully removing a legally elected government

5879837 in a modern dictatorship however with its subterranean ubiquity and all embracing instruments of oppression a revolt means certain death to all who support it the future in modern society depends much more on the quiet heroism of the very few who are inspired by god these few will greatly enjoy the divine inspiration and will be prepared to stand for the dignity of man and true freedom and to keep the law of god even if it means martyrdom or death because they look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are unseen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things that are unseen are eternal

5879858 none is righteous no not one 11 no one understands no one seeks for god 12 all have turned aside together they have become worthless no one does good not even one
5879859 the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field which a man found and covered up then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field
5879860 if anyone would come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me 24 for whoever would save his life will lose it but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it
5879861 if anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters yes and even his own life he cannot be my disciple christ isnt interested in being tacked on he will not be one of our idols we must have no other gods before him we can think of it like this matthew left everything that would keep him from following christ god may not ask us to leave our jobs behind but we must jettison anything that hinders our devotion to christ for matthew repentance meant a change of professions he would give up his devotion to herod antipas and the roman regime and be fully devoted to christ we see another way matthew was showing his repentance 29 and levi made him a great feast in his house and there was a large company of tax collectors and others reclining at table with them he was now interested in showing his new treasure jesus christ to his friends the only people matthew new were other tax gatherers and other sinners perhaps these were some of the publicans that first heard about repentance through john the baptist at any rate publicans were now being introduced to christ through a converted publican jesus is showing everyone why he came to earth christianity is not for good people in calling matthew jesus shows us a great truth i have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance
5879862 why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners
5879863 now his older son was in the field and as he came and drew near to the house he heard music and dancing
5879864 but woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you shut the kingdom of heaven in peoples faces for you neither enter yourselves nor allow those who would enter to go in
5879865 woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you clean the outside of the cup and the plate but inside they are full of greed and self indulgence 26 you blind pharisee first clean the inside of the cup and the plate that the outside also may be clean
5879866 woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you are like whitewashed tombs which outwardly appear beautiful but within are full of dead peoples bones and all uncleanness 28 so you also outwardly appear righteous to others but within you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness jesus would rather have a helpless sinner than a self righteous person any day have you ever thought you were better than someone else have you ever thought that you were basically a good person the truth is we are all sinners we are sinners by nature and by deed heres what we have to get right we sin because were sinners sin comes from within secular psychologists want us to think that were basically good and that because of something from outside of us whether it be our environment parents whatever we do wrong things thats not true we are bad on the inside our corruption is from within mark 7 15 esv there is nothing outside a person that by going into him can defile him but the things that come out of a person are what defile him
5879867 those who are well have no need of a physician but those who are sick 32 i have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance
5879868 this is why i told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted him by the father
5879869 sinful man in need not of inducements or assistance to save himself but precisely of saving and jesus christ has come not to advise or urge or woo or help him save himself but to save him

5879891 surface water pro uses greenstar tm components that many of our customers already own
5879892 compared to a laser system that has high start up costs the surface water pro software is an economical more accurate alternative for managing ditches and levees
5879893 the survey mode records elevations of their fields for later use
5879894 survey points do not need to be recorded as a separate operation and can be collected while doing work in the field such as during planting harvesting or tillage all elevation information is recorded and saved on a data card and can be downloaded to desktop software such as apex
5879895 apex desktop software is used to manage the information collected for ditch track and levee track data
5879896 three types of maps can be collected and saved with apex including depression flow direction and digitized elevation maps
5879897 for advanced ditching operations weve also introduced surface water pro plus
5879898 integrated with the gs2 2600 display this new system takes water management to the next level and brings advanced technology for improved ditching functions
5879899 there are two methods to create a ditch with surface water pro plus
5879900 the first is linear drain which is much like a laser system because it uses a straight line to create a grade where the water is pooled and where it needs to exit the field
5879901 the second is a best fit drain which creates a non linear path by which the ditch will be cut the line is calculated so that the least amount of soil is moved to efficiently guide the water off the field this reduces time and fuel needed to create ditches and gives operators the ability to edit ditch track lines that were previously created
5879902 while the media tends to focus on the adverse and the dramatic americas beef producers continue to communicate the message that we are dedicated to producing a product that is of highest integrity quality and safety
5879903 we have a well regulated system in place to protect the american food supply taking it one step further in the supply chain the checkoff is now working to educate consumers about the safety of the u s beef supply ultimately helping our consumers feel more confident in choosing and safely preparing beef for their families
5879904 what man doesnt want to be the king of the grill however the checkoff wants to make sure that king comes equipped with a thermometer and 160 degrees cooking instructions
5879905 we have found after looking deeper that through ongoing frequent exposure to a message promoting the use of thermometers to ensure both a safe and delicious eating experience consumer behavior could be changed again at every step of the production chain producers are investing in checkoff programs that ensure our product is fit for a king

5879945 besides being an authentic native american he needs to have charm and charisma at this point catherine is more concerned about finding someone with the right looks and personality than she is about prior acting experience and he needs to be available for sequels this will be an amazing opportunity for one lucky teenager
5879946 it is always a challenge to find the right actor for a part that has lived so vividly in the imaginations of readers but we took the responsibility seriously and are confident with rob pattinson that we have found the perfect edward for our bella in twilight

5879955 its all about money with him it probably didnt matter to him whether it was real or not
5879956 they probably started out small as a way to promote their bigfoot tracking business and got in way over their heads

5879976 esto es solo un punto de partida y se necesitar n recursos por un valor 40 veces superior mil 700 millones de d lares para poder elaborar un paquete de desarrollo m s sustancial y completo de cara al futuro
